Also have a make-your-own salad option but it gets pricey if you want a lot of stuff. I think it's a better deal to get one of the specialty ones and they'll let you substitute stuff if you don't like something (some restrictions on stuff like hard boiled eggs but I've never had an issue doing veggie for veggie subs). You can ask for any dressing too. They also do phone and online orders if you're in a real rush or ordering multiple entrees.",

He was rude when I arrived at 220 and I asked if I could add something to my order.  He was even more rude when it was time to pay.
