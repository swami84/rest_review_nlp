Both the dinner platters were flavorful, with a variety of roasted vegetables.  The lamb was exquisite, tender and falling off the bone.  The baguette was crusty and the almond croissant delicate with just the right amount of marizpan baked inside.  La Jolie Bleue is family owned and service is personal and warm, with explanations of how the dishes are made.  This restaurant is a gem and a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.",
