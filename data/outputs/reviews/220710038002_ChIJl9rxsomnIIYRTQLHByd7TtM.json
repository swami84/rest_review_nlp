The way she approached us was simply \u201cwhat will you guys be ordering\u201d no hello my name is XYZ today special or this is a really good option just rudeness no smile nothing so that put everything in a weird awkward situation to begin with then I asked her about the drinks there was a bar list and there\u2019s also drinks that says they are $10 I asked her about a pacific drink that was on the bar list she told me I don\u2019t know what price it is and I would have to go look so I said once she find out the price I will probably order that but in the meantime I ordered a 10$ drink with cognac in it and Prosecco. Once she came back to the table with our sodas and cocktails she never told me the price of the other drink I was inquiring about so I just didn\u2019t worry about it we went ahead and put in the food order everything I ordered was absolutely good I will say that the food is very good however the service is terrible the waitress was rude I also ordered chips and salsa please beware this salsa is nothing like the authentic Mexican salsa it was strictly onions and tomatoes in it just looked horrible the presentation I did not like even though the menu item was only 4$ bucks it just wasn\u2019t something I was going on eat! so I did let the waitress know I did not like that type of pico and I ask for another item which was the mashed bolts balls (yum) So she said I don\u2019t know I will have to talk to my manager about that so she\u2019s came back to the table and said \u201c my manager said I can go ahead and take it off this time\u201d  so as the other menu items came the manager came to the table and say hi how is everything going I heard we had a problem earlier is everything OK? I said yes everything is perfect I just never seen that type of pico before I am a foodie I eat out a lot so it wasn\u2019t something I was interested in she said well I went ahead and took it off but if it was my manager they probably wouldn\u2019t have took it off for you, so next time know what you want to order!!! I told her exactly how I felt respectfully but this was a very uncomfortable experience for me and left a bad taste in my mouth once I told her everything and her choice of words on handling the situation she went ahead and told me it was her first time being by herself as a manager its not these girls fault maybe they need more training and learn how to deal with customers I have been in this industry before please note \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d it\u2019s nothing to take away a untouched appetizer and that was another thing the manager asked me if I eat any of it and I told her I didn\u2019t touch any of it the appearance made me not want any parts of it but who questions a customer especially asking did you eat any of it clearly I didn\u2019t touch any of it it was still in the same position it came out. So that\u2019s that hope the head mangers get this message",

Came for the brass band but it had been canceled. I had heard that it was the best. Grabbed some drinks while we were waiting on a friend to join. Got the Juno and a French75. The Juno speciality drink was awful and \" it taste like licking a stick of deodorant\". Not even kidding...was awful. The French75 was good but I was charged $11 for the French75 and then another $6 to add the Gin. Not sure why? For the appetizers, we wanted to get the chips and pico but they had just ran out so my fianc\u00e9 settled for the the chips and pimento cheese. I don't do dairy but they said that it was the best thing we had. We ordered some crawfish and they were cooked/seasoned well. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and when it finally came out it was fried and had a line of BBQ sauce on the pun. Was very confused as it didn't say it was fried on the menu. I don't eat fried food so I had to send it back. My waiter was super friendly and very courteous though. Ordered the bean burger and it came out half-frozen in the middle. The side salad I'm not even going to mention. In all...one big miss. Liked the vibe but either the drinks or food need to step it up. $70 total bill with only $15 quality/content.",

On the other hand: we don't drink but wanted to support their offering. We went in and orderes two Cokes: $8 and so terribly watered down we didn't drink them. Also, the band kept guilting the audience for tips and were stopping after every song to pass around their tip bucket and heckle. They even threatened to stop playing if they didn't get more tips! It just felt awkward and pathetic.  We were happy to support artists but I sure hope this place was paying them. And if they did pay them then hopefully the Yard will ask future bands to not be so hard on the patrons; it undermined the experience. Happy to pay top-dollar for watered down Coke OR tip generously, but we didn't care to do both and still be heckled to give more!",

I'm not sure what was even on it and I really wasn't that hungry but Oh My Gosh that was the best sandwich I've ever had!!!  I devoured the entire loaf of deliciousness. The service and patio were favorable too!",
