My was medium rare and juicy, my wife's was medium well and dry. And the entire table seemed to be one way or the other.  Aside from that, all the food tasted very fresh. The bar tenders poured a nice cocktail with a smile every time, and the event was clean. Definitely had a nice evening with my wife and her family.",
