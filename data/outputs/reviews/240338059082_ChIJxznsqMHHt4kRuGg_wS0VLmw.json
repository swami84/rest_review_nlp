I decided to rate this place 2/5 because I spoke to the manager and he stated that I could make another order and pick it up the following day. I thought to myself that was a nice gesture.

We have waited 45 minutes for our appetizer and another 38 minutes on top of that for our pots to come out and we were served cold seafood pots. I know this restaurant has a problem with bad comments all the time about the food that comes out. The Lobsters fall apart due to it being overcooked , they slide right out the shell with no taste at all , crabs having an aftertaste of fish and mainly it\u2019s due to the chef or whomever that is handling the food behind that kitchen. Parking there is two hours and for us to wait for another pot to be redone would\u2019ve taken another hour to come out. We left without eating.

Now, I am at risk of food poisoning. I asked the manager for my money back because you cannot serve customers cold seafood nor undone seafood. She graciously offered 10% of our total (unacceptable) or if we wanted to wait for the plates to be cooked again. We already wasted 1 hour and 30 minutes plus $60.

They do not offer 1/2 lbs of seafood options or create your own seafood bags like the other places I mentioned. They are in a high rent area so I get why the prices are higher but if you want to charge higher prices,  serve quality food and give people EVERYTHING listed that's suppose to come with the meal. I ordered the shrimp to go (which upon getting home had the head on, which isn't stated on the menu), ordered the mix seasoning and medium heat. It was bland and I had to add hot sauce and Old Bay. I was missing the sausage AND not given the option of rice/noodles/bread/etc (which I didn't get either). It was not busy so I dunno how that was missed. I also ordered the $12.95 gumbo and despite the price, liked that I could substitute the white rice with the jambalaya for only $1. The gumbo was ok but Hook and Reel makes an AMAZING seafood-filled gumbo for half the price. The jambalaya was good and very well seasoned but shrimp was thrown on top and didn't looked cooked. I put the shrimp in hot water hoping they would cook but they continued to be gray (which I have never seen before). The one bright spot is the customer service; the employees were extremely nice and attentive. I appreciate great customer service and they were excellent. Unfortunately I won't be back.",

Once i got there shortly after calling, i saw that the place was closed. Luckily I called and was informed that the kitchen closed at 2 but said that they'd make the fries for me. I dont know why the employee didnt tell me they'd be closing shortly when i called but I'm glad the woman worked with me. I got the garlic crab fries for $17. It took them less than 5 minutes for them to prepare it so the food was obviously sitting around. I expected a bit more crab for that price. It wasnt nearly as much crab as i seen on these posted pictures. The crab didnt taste like much. The large amount of garlic in the fries overpowered any taste that might've been there.I've never seen so much garlic in food, normally garlic is cut up fine but i had big chunks of garlic, so much garlic that i could've used it for another meal. If anything, i can say they definitely use fresh garlic. I've added a picture of all the garlic that i didnt eat. This will be my first and last visit here.",

The portions and quality of snow crab, shrimp, mussels and crawfish was well worth the money. I purchased again from this establishment last night and ordered the seafood jambalaya with a caesar salad. Words cannot describe how dreadful the seafood jambalaya tasted and was prepared. It was a bland mess with barely any shrimp, chicken or sausage period. They basically dumped a ton of raw tomato sauce atop overcooked mushy rice and barely included any meat items into this unholy concoction. It was completely opposite of what was demonstrated with my previous experience with the seafood boil. I actually had to doublecheck and see if I ordered from the same establishment, as this menu item was not even edible especially for the $15 price tag. It was depressing to know I wasted my money on a bowl of bland slop with barely any shrimp, chicken or sausage. This item is a disrespectful representation of Cajun food period, especially if you've had quality Cajun cuisine prior to encountering this tragedy. This establishment is clearly capable of producing quality cuisine as it was demonstrated in my previous purchase, but I'm at a loss this time around as I wasted $15 on the seafood jambalaya which I could not consume. The only reason I put 1 star in my review was due to the caesar salad that I also ordered being decent and tasty. This was not enough to overshadow the horrific result of the seafood jambalaya. This establishment needs to either overhaul or delete this item from their  food menu permanently. Hopefully any potential patrons of this establishment take heed to my warning and refrain from facing disappointment by purchasing the seafood jambalaya.",

The staff are friendly, expedient, and attractive (especially the guys at the bar and on the floor). I love the crab legs with the extra spicy mixed sauce. Definitely go for the fried baskets and the crab fries. The gumbo, jambalaya, and etoufee are not my favorite. The owners are very polite and will definitely have a conversation with you. Overall, I recommend that anyone who likes seafood and like trying new perspectives on original cuisine, should come to this place. Please don't try to compare it to HooknReel or Hot Juicy because they all do this differently. And if you grab a drink, go for the Rum Punch or mimosas during brunch!",

Everything we ate was amazing and the service was knowledgeable and very friendly.  We do not live in the area but will be making this a must stop on every time through here.  I truly loved the sauce and you can even buy a jar to take home which we did of course. Came on a Saturday and was surprized to find out they even had a happy hour on Saturdays which is an unusual find and saved us money on the drinks.

Ive never had an issue, service was always wonderful. The presentation is awesome. I had been looking for a reliable place i could go to for when I wanted something great and im glad i found it. If you get a seafood pot with sauce dont hesitate to order some rice along with it. The sausage and potato inside the pot with everything is divine. The crab legs arent small, the crawfish are good and so is the shrimp. The clam chowder is AMAZING! The crab dip i would give a 3/5 it should be chunkier and have a bit more meat in it. The shrimp tacos were marvelous. A little messy but everyone has a way of doing things. The fried shrimp basket was ok, a bit overcooked but the fries (garlic) (yes you can choose what kind of fries you get )rescued the dish. The atmosphere is peaceful and its a good place to for a girls night or a family dinner. The price range is anywhere from 15-100 and up depending on how many people and your add ons. The staff is very accommodating and I cant wait to go back!  TIP: when getting the lemon seafood pot tell them to go light on the garlic",

If you order lobster, you have to cancel the order and re-purchase. It will waste a lot of time.Today, I ordered lobster. They told me no lobster\uff0cand I have to cancel it by myself. After I canceled the order, I found that the restaurant was closed. So I called the restaurant. They told me that I could make a call uber eats support, they will help you to make an order. However, the staff told me that the restaurant was closed. This makes me very angry. Why can't the restaurant tell me  they have already closed directly?",

My son got seafood sliders for $6. You choose between catfish or shrimp. Sangria is on Happy hour menu, however they were out. So I asked our server to see IF they had Barefoot, Sutter Home or Beringer red wine. She came back to tell me that the bar had NO Red wine. I was blown. They had Chardonnay.

In the end we had food to take home because our eyes were bigger than our stomachs!!! Food was great, atmosphere was great, we ate at the bar. The bartender was nice, great customer service!!! Wanted to return the next day!!!! I gave four stars because it was warm inside, dont know what's going on with the AC, was here before and left immediately because it was hot!! Please when its 90 + degrees outside it shouldn't be 80 + inside!!!!",

They taste like the crawfish was boiled with out any seasoning in the boil then a ton was thrown in the bag and tossed around which smells and looks good but leaves the inside completely bland. I grew up on the gulf eating crawfish and I\u2019m a big crawfish person. I mean I grew up sucking the head of the crawfish for the juice these ones just taste of dirt. They really need to get the seasoning all the way through. The gumbo was just bland it taste of store bought premade gumbo. The roux was extra thick like gravy which doesn\u2019t make for a good gumbo cause none of the juice can be absorbed in the pieces inside the gumbo. The shrimp also came on the side and wasn\u2019t seasoned so when you put it in the gumbo now you have another bland element in it. It had a sweet taste but not the smooth spice that usually comes with gumbo. I am simply disappointed. For the price and what you actually get it doesn\u2019t match up. They need to learn to season all there food properly and not after the fact. This place is trying to be a nice restaurant and crawfish isn\u2019t that type of food and their trying to make it so. It just all comes off bad. But the inside of the restaurant is very beautiful.",

This was the only food i had tonite and I'm about to literally throw it up. Sad I have to throw up the crab fries too. What a waste of money. Their ramen with shoyu base was ok.",

The fish in the catfish basket was very flaky and crisp to perfection. Seafood bao only included two, we were expecting at least four for the price paid. The blackened catfish was pretty good flavor and the salsa was great. The blackened catfish was a little soft which made me think it was originally frozen. Lastly, the Seafood pho was our least favorite the flavor of the broth was a little off tasting. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and had great service.",

I was surprised that a knife and spoon wasn't given with what we ordered, but I'm sure they were available on request. I'd have preferred larger napkins to the small paper ones, but there were plenty of them. Our waitresses also have us latex gloves for our shrimp course.",
