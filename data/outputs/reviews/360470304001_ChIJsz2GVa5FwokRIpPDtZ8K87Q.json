The chicken wings came in these foil bags that just added to the already soggy fried chicken(it wasn't fried properly or they sent old/stored chicken wings). The egg rolls(ordered 3) were still immersed in their own oil to the point where if you got one out of the bag the oil seeped out of the egg roll it was disgusting.
