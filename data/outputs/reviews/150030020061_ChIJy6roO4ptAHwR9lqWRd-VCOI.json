When confronted with his violation of the law, he took my drink away, refunded me $5 of my $6 cocktail & kicked me out saying \"I\" had too much to drink. I asked him for water & he still kicked me out. I called 911 & reported to police as it is illegal to use an e-cigarette in a bar in Hawaii.",

This place has a unique charm all it's own.  Peaceful booths to relax after a long day, drinks are pretty reasonably priced and the wine cellar room is a must see.  The Good: Bartenders are very knowledgable on local drinks and trust me they keep them flowing.  Bar is dimly lit and can offer anyone looking for a space to unwind away from the hectic's of Waikiki will find refuge inside this bar. Bathroom is clean and well lit.  The Bad: Such a small place with only one entrance could deter those with a desire for easily escaping that creepy guy or gal you want to get away from.  Things To Try: Bartenders have a vast knowledge of the local drinks, but try The French 75, The Mind Eraser and the Bellini.  You wont be disappointed. Edit Remove Listed in: Best Happy Hour",
