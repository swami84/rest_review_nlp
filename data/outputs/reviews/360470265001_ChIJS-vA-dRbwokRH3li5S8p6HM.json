I live in Manhattan but have friends on Tompkins Ave but even if I didnt Macosa alone is worth the trip! It was good to-go but way better in person! The old wood and great art made for wonderful ambiance.  The apps of which we ordered several were crispy, creamy and delicious. The fritto misto had a deep, flavorful crunch and was wonderfully tender inside. The zippy calabrian chili dipping sauce set it off perfectly. Fresh burrata served over thick artisan toast with blistered baby bells and italian style salsa verde, not only looked divine but tasted even better. I eat a lot so I ordered two entrees. Homemade duck and ricotta raviolis finished with fresh herbs in a perfectly acidic and buttery sauce, were great. With lots of stuffing and tender homeade pasta I would order them again. But for me during a night of wins the big time score was the Guanciale a Manzo. Braised pork served with thick style bread in a salty and unctuous gravy was like the best braised short rib I've ever had but with even more flavor!! Truly gorgeous. I had a couple italian craft beers you wont find anywhere else, except maybe Rome and they were very tasty. Needless to say I was too full and satisfied to have desert so i ordered a tiramisu to-go and just had it. Surprise surprise, it was delicious. Creamier than others I've had and perfectly soaked I will be having it again. Sal our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly and a great compliment to the even better food. This place is a gem and when you're ready to bust out of your covid-induced shell this should be your go-to. Next time we will be dining on their outdoor patio. Cant wait!!",

        "caption": "Awesome place with ridiculously good food. We started with the Arancini, fritto misto, panzanella salad, mozzarella Carroza and a buratta special served on thick toast. All were excellent. The arancini was fried nicely on the outside and super creamy on the inside. Panzanella  was nice and fresh. The sauce served with the fritto misto was a zesty Calabrian dipping sauce (I asked the waiter) that I\u2019d never had before. It was very yummy. For main course I had the Rigatoni ala Norma with crispy eggplant. It was divine. All of the red sauce I tasted here was right on point. My husband got the guancialli a manzo - (I think it was braised pork cheek) and it was wildly good.  Like I wish I had ordered it. Picture the best braised short ribs you\u2019ve ever had- but with more flavor. Overall a fabulous meal. Will definitely be back!",
