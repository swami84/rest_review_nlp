        "caption": "Was excited to finally try this place - saw it recommended as one of Chicago's 20 Best Outdoor Restaurants (Time-out Chicago).  For those that don't know, this is a local (and popular) watering hole in Wicker Park, tucked into a mostly residential neighborhood. Great hole-in-the-wall appeal. We were fortunate coming on a Thursday (in March) just after 4:30pm. Not many customers yet at that time, we were seated right away (there were three of us). Covid protocols are good - with temp checks and required masks. The service was very friendly, from the wait staff to the manager. Inside was charming and ambiance was awesome, themed out in Mardi Gras with hanging beads, glitter masks, and lights!  The food was a bit hit or miss, though nothing was exceptional. We ordered a Shrimp Po'boy, Nashville Chicken Po'boy, and a Catfish plate with a hush puppies appetizer and beignets as the desert - with a couple of Diet Cokes for drinks. Everything just seemed like it was suffering from cost-cutting measures.  The hush puppies were deep south Cajun-style hush puppies with large pieces of peppers, onions, and corn. Despite all that mixed in, they tasted bland, dry, and somewhat stale, like they'd been sitting out or a few days old.  The french roll on the Shrimp Po'boy also tasted stale and they tried to disguise it by toasting it slightly. The shrimp seemed like it had been bought cooked and frozen, and then fried that way - it was very rubbery. It wasn't stacked with lettuce and tomato like they show in Google videos I'd previously seen. It was also dry - with not much mayo and with about an ounce of hot sauce. It didn't taste bad - and that's mostly because it didn't have much of a taste with an overall lack of seasoning.  The catfish on the other hand seemed undercooked and expired. It reminded me of fish you'd buy on sale at the supermarket because it hadn't sold in two weeks. It probably could have used another minute or two in the frying oil.  The Nashville fried chicken was good - tender on the inside and crispy on the outside with good flavor. It paired well with the Nashville Hot Sauce that was sweet and not that spicy (which we liked).  The beignets were great and easily the most authentic item we tried. Perfectly cooked, hearty and soft on the inside. Not too sweet, but a nice overall taste with the powdered sugar.  The Diet Coke was ok, tasted like it needed syrup and the fries were nothing special - just plain with some Cajun spice added. One minor quirk was the Po'boys weren't cut in thirds - didn't really make a difference, but every picture I've seen of food from here showed the Po'boys cut in thirds. Maybe their B team was duty this night, or maybe the cost-cutting is getting them through covid. Whatever the reason, it did not meet our expectations. But, not gonna write them off - perhaps it's something we'll try again in normal times.",

Then when I asked about the Jambalaya he stated that this had to be called in 24 hours in advance, however, there is no indication of this on their website or flyer. So when I mentioned that they might want to update the site, he stated \u201cI told them to update it so, like I said I don\u2019t develop the website\u201d. Furthermore, as I spoke amongst my family stating that this was very misleading, the General Manager told me \u201cIt is what it is\u201d. My aunt, shocked, asked him if this is what he said, and he replied \u201cYup\u201d. I then asked if there was a number to contact for someone higher or corporate and he was very snotty and said we don\u2019t have a corporate office, but you can go ahead and leave a review. He was very arrogant and was not pleasant at all! I wouldn\u2019t recommend this establishment!!!!!

I like how the seats/tables indoor were spread apart nicely.  We started with the Gumbo which was amazzzzzing and flavorful. We paired it with their DELICIOUS biscuits. Please give it a try!!!  We got the fried seafood tower and the catfish was to die for. Flavorful and everything came out hot and in a timely manner. Sooo worth it!  This place is a gem with delicious food! If you\u2019re not a fan of the small mixed drinks in plastic cups (because of COVID) then order a beer! Overall we had a great time and this place deserves your business!!! \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb",

I will start off by saying the staff was nice and friendly I did not have a \"bad\" experience but the execution of the restaurants dishes was poor and lacking in taste I would not return.  I went with a friend I ordered the boiled shrimp. Warning the shrimp is NOT DEVEINED and i could see waste oozing out of the shrimp as I unpeeled it.  My friend ordered fried chicken which was undercooked. We sent the chicken back twice and both times it was hard to pull apart and slightly pink on the inside.  The manager was nice enough to come out and check on us as well as comp my friends undercooked chicken meal and provide an alternative.",

The website say patio seeting open and dining room require reservations.  There is no dining room and no patio. There's a sidewalk with chairs and tables cramped on it and a room with a bar and a couple chairs. Completely didn't expect what I saw based on how they describe the place on the website. Then the host seemed to not want to add my name to wait for a table. Told us we couldn't sit at the bar only to later find out after oh maybe half an hour that the bar was open for seating. The host seemed to have a problem with people of color imo and as tempted as I was to just spend my dollar elsewhere I was starving and decided to just stay. The food was good. Southern style. Not the best sanitation going on behind the bar in terms of handling money then making people's drinks. Overall, get it together! People come and decide to spend their time and money with you under the current circumstances shouldn't have to deal with rude wait-staff and questionable drinks and sanitation.",

We asked the employees if someone could take our order. They stated someone would be with us to take our order. We waited around with no service again..... We ended up drinking a few cups of water hoping for service that never came. We decided to leave since we could not get service. A person who may have been a manager ended up following us into the street after a short while and caught up to us. She asked us what was wrong. I explained that we could get no service. We were invited to please come again. Will not try again. Do not recommend to others.",

It is a $9 hoax, no real cheese pulling away from the pasta, just spiral sauced  pasta in a small donut sized container. The oysters on the po boy was good although the let down is that there's like 10-15 fries that come with it and I had to toss the bread cause it was stale. Fam had the collard greens, no salt is tasted, just spice and an over powering mesquite smoke flavor. Fam had fried catfish and shrimp they said it was good but the bread that comes with it was stale. Overall review: Over priced and Boosted.  Again, this is not a BOE OR BOR, per Chicago Tribune the owner is Mark Domitrovich and the executive chef is Brian Jupiter from N.O.",

The NOLA hot sausage sliders, crispy cauliflower, and the crab and cheese fondue were all amazing.  Once I had the Fried Chicken, I immediately called my friend who considers himself a connoisseur and told him he needs to try this place immediately.  Drinks were good but a little on the small side for the price.  They were selling snow cones out of a side window but the line was huge so we passed on that.  Service was a little slow but certainly not for lack of effort - they probably just needed another hand.  I would say this is like a 4.5, but rounding up since it's probably the best Fried Chicken I've ever had in my life.",

My third visit was a take out and items were missing and there were menu discrepancies from what was shown online versus what was they actually had.  I chalked this up to a fluke and decided to give the restaurant one more try. Went back in for my fourth visit and the food was sub par at best.  The Hot Honey Chicken was over cooked and extremely dry (I've ordered this 3 times before and it used to be fantastic).  The biscuit was under cooked, flat and doughy.  I walked past the kitchen to use the wash room and saw a rack filled with the fried chicken and biscuits sitting out (restaurant had about 6 tables of people at this time) meaning that food was likely recooked in the fryer drying it out.  The fried shrimp tasted bland and not like it has in the past.  The only item from our meal that was somewhat enjoyable was the hush puppies.  Used to love this restaurant but the quality has declined over my visits that I will no longer be returning.",

Took a while to get initial service and 20 minutes to get my hurricane. It was tasty, but not sweet or strong which is kind of the nature of a hurricane. The baked oysters were very good, but $3.50 each. The fried oysters were also very good. I loved their potato salad. The gumbo was the least \"gumbo-like\" soup I've ever been served. They put cold potato salad (cross between southern and german) in the bottom of the bowl along with the rice which not only added a very odd flavor, but drastically brought the temperature of the soup down...it was barely warm by the time we were half way done. The shrimp and andouille seemed to be thrown in at the end, almost as an after thought....their flavors were really not present in the broth. Fried chicken was $14 for 3 pcs... a small leg, wing and breast. I liked the flavor,  but my hubby hated it. There was quite a bit of \"hot honey\" drizzled on top which made all of the breading pretty soggy.",

Finally got chance to check it out during a restaurant crawl. Let me tell you when people do crawls this is the a great opportunity for you to expose yourself to new people. They failed. I waited almost 45 for the 3 item smaller pictured below. Restaurant wasn\u2019t that busy and numerous people that arrived after me got served first. Food was just ok.  Definitely not worth the wait. Probably won\u2019t go back. Great concept though. Decor is cool.",

The catfish was well seasoned, the draft selection reasonably varied, but the house-made hot sauces were forgettable vinegar solutions. Expect this place to always be out of crawfish for about half the year as they do not use the frozen variety when the fresh are out of season.

The decor, food menu, and cocktail selections all wonderfully establish Ina Mae\u2019s Louisiana vibe. Sadly, the service and the quality of the food can\u2019t quite live up to the same high bar as the atmosphere. My girlfriend and I were attended to infrequently by the wait staff, and while the food was decent (we had the alligator Po Boy, the Cajun Elote, and the Fried Chicken), it was nothing worth coming back for. Overall, Ina Mae\u2019s is a firmly middle-of-the-road establishment that pulls you in with its Cajun veneer, but fails to make you yearn for more",
