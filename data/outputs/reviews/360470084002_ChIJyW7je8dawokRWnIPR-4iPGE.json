They really need to either hire people who know how to talk/deal with customers or teach them how to serve people. Every time I come into the store for a carry out they're always in the back just talking or chilling. They have the bad habit of ignoring customers and hanging up on them when they. Last time I had to talk to the \"manager\" because I sent my brother to pick up the food and they wouldn't give it to him because of security reasons. While I understand that it is important to prevent robbing and stealing, the way he handled the situation was absurd. He started telling me that it has always been like that when I know that's not true. I've been a regular customer for a couple of months there and most of the time I always send my brother. It's sad that they don't care about customer service because it's really bad.",

Just because u have a brand name doesn't make you the only pizza place to order from. Specially in this sunset park. Wish people would stop giving places like these business. You can spend a few more dollars for good treatment.  Update: I decided to order from them again after having family members arrived from pa yesterday. These delivery driver stated he doesn\u2019t feel safe to come out of his car and ring my door bell and because I didn\u2019t answer he left. My only guess is that he is discriminating because it a Spanish neighborhood and the driver had and Indian or Arab accent. It\u2019s not fair to the customers and for the store to call me back and blame me for them not ringing my door bell. He didn\u2019t know if I was in the shower that why I didn\u2019t answer.",

I would still come for food buy highly recommend that they star treating all customers as equals with the same persistence that they would use for orders that are ready to get those customers out just as fast. I understand that this is a fast food business just like any other and maybe there is some frustrations due to this but it doesn't excuse behavior that makes me question where my money is going.  besides that...dominoes is ok to me.

Also, their driver Eskander is lazy and doesn't want to go upstairs to deliver your pizzas. If you paid for delivery and are going to tip, I'm sure you'd expect them to come bring you the pizza, not you to come downstairs, pay delivery charges, and still have to tip the dude for sitting in his car. So if you have young kids and you're by yourself, if you see this man delivering your pizzas, be prepared to either leave your kids alone, take them with you, or get your order cancelled.",

When I spoke to the manager, about the driver refusing to bring the food inside because he \"didnt want to leave his van\" he continued to yell and tell me that I was wasted his time, and that the did not care if I got my food or not.
