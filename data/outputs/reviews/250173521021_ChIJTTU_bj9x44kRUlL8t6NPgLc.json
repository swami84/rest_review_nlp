That said I cannot in good conscience recommend the Lily P's due to their food. My friend and I ordered drinks which were great, unfortunately it was all downhill from here. We then had appetizers oysters and cornbread. She said the oysters were devoid of flavor and the cornbread was so dense you could bounce it off the floor. I was hoping the entrees could offer some redemption, however the Lily P fried chicken sandwich was tough, dry and very thin, honestly chic-fil-a and bojangles consistently give much better chicken sandwiches for cheaper prices. My friend got a salad with added grilled chicken, when the salad came out there was so little chicken that we actually asked the runner if the chicken was coming out separately, to which he pointed to the 4 smallest pieces of chicken you had ever seen. There needs to be serious redesign of the menu and items chosen if they plan on being known for their food.",
