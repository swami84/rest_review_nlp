This used to be a great location but apparently, a change in management and/or ownership has made this place the epitome of unprofessional service.  My review is not based on one bad experience; it is based on a few bad experiences during different times of the day with the same issues.  Today's order was supposed to be delivered to me in 35 minutes, according to the email order confirmation that I received.  Once an hour passed, I called the restaurant to inquire about my order.  The rude employee replied \"it's coming.\"  I asked the employee \"when exactly?\"  Then the employee replied \"the delivery driver just left the store.\"  30 additional minutes passed and I called the store back to inquire; then a different employee said that the driver just left 10 minutes ago.  This was an indication that the first employee did not tell the truth.  Then an additional 30 minutes passed and I called back for the third time; I was on hold for several minutes.  Being on hold for several minutes with this location is also very common.  Then finally, after waiting on my order for close to two hours, it was finally delivered; of course, the food was cold upon delivery.  This place is full of workers with poor work ethic and a nonchalant attitude about serving the customer.",

When I arrive they were leaving with an order for delivery and mine wasn\u2019t even there. I asked for a discount and the employee said she wouldn\u2019t. She was even charging me for delivery still. This store should be shut down. It\u2019s a complete embarrassment for Pizza Hut, I had to take my pizza cold.

I don\u2019t know what these other people talking about great customer service. I called again after the 2nd time and that\u2019s when Mario wants to tell me their short staffed. I could\u2019ve gotten food from somewhere else and just say forget it! Didn\u2019t even get asked if we wanted anything extra for waiting so long. Goodbye to this location & every other Pizza Hut location. PAPA JOHNS HERE I COME!!! PS...Too bad you can\u2019t choose no stars!",

I said yes please ask him because i never canceled my order and I have been waiting for my food for dinner for an hour and a half. He comes back on the line and states that the manager cancelled the order because the driver was at my apartment, called, didnt get an answer and \"left to make other deliveries\". I explained to him that i never recieved neither a phone call nor a knock on my door, the employee says \"theres nothing i could do about it what do you want\" and i asked if I Could speak to the manager. The manager gets on the line and says \"you wanted to speak to me\" and I said yes I would like to know why my order was cancelled and I was not even aware of it. I have been waiting for my pizza for dinner for an hour and a half, i never got a phone call from the driver and my phone had been working fine, he didnt even knock. The manager goes \"well our driver calls and if theres no pick up he leaves and im the one who tells him to do that\" i said are you serious? You call once which i didnt even get a call, dont even knock and never inform me that my order was cancelled?!? I was infuriated and all he could say was well you will get your money back on your card. Not even trying to resolve the problem or do anything for the customer as a good manager would do!! I made sure my order was cancelled and after so many times of ordering from this pizza hut I will NEVER order again!! Absolutely disgusting service! The manager should be FIRED and the staff should be retrained! Completely ridiculous! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PIZZA HUT!",

Driver was on his way back to location to pick up my order. Took 2 hrs. If I wasn't so hungry I would have cancelled. Not to mention pizza was cold as ice. Just disrespectful.",

THE ONLY OPTIONS WERE EITHER MCDONALDS OR PIZZAHUT AND THEY DONT LIKE MCDONALD'S NASTY FOOD. AFTER CALLING REPEATEDLY, NOONE ANSWERED THE STORE PHONE SO I COULD NOT DO A CALL-IN DELIVERY AND I DID NOT WANT TO USE ONLINE ORDERING SINCE I HAD ISSUES WITH MY CREDIT CARD WITH YOUR WEBSITE PREVIOUSLY. I WALKED THE 5 BLOCKS IN THE DARK AND RAINING WEATHER TO GET THE PIZZA AND THE MANAGER/CASHIER TURNED ME AWAY RUDELY AT 9:32 PM SAYING \"NO! WE ARE CLOSED! WE ARE CLOSED\". I WAS HIGHLY UPSET THAT HE WAS VERY RUDE ESPECIALLY SINCE HE DIDNT EVEN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE ANY SERVICE PRIOR TO CLOSING HRS. YOUR WEBSITE AND THE STORE CLEARLY STATE YOU CLOSE SUNDAYS AT 10PM. SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THIS FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF COMPLIMENTARY PIZZA OR COMPENSATION OF SOME SORT.",
