The pizza here looks great, but I went for the sandwiches for something new.  The Lazzo, this sandwich is filled will a lot of Italian meats (Salami, Capicola, Mortadella) and Provolone. The sandwich is very good, but expect it to be salty because of the types of meat. It is something I would recommend but personally I will only buy this once for fun and to try something new. Great sandwich overall... Next time I must try the pizza!",

Egg white, sharp provolone, mushroom and drizzled  of salt where placed . The bread was soft and thick as a cloud and it surprisingly complimented the simplistic ingredients (Egg white, sharp provolone, mushroom and salt) that housed rich flavors. In honestly, I paused about 7 times trying to comprehend it\u2019s so deliciousness.  Not to be obscene but this is the kind of meal you have after having and intimate night and or morning.  Superb!",

The meat was juicy but not dripping, which I prefer. It was cut a little thick for porchetta and because of that some slices had large pieces of fat. Otherwise, it had great flavor and was cooked well, really nice finished with some olive oil and sea salt on top. I only saw the sides but they all looked good and I hope to give them a try soon.",
