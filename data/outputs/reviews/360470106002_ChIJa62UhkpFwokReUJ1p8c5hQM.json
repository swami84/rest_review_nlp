The bacon mushroom is my all time favorite, it is sooo good!!!  My best friend and boyfriend really enjoyed their chicken wing but it\u2019s a bit difficult to eat since the whole wing on the stick.  I read other reviews that sometime they miss some of the items you order so I usually write down everything on my phone. If they do miss something I will have proof since I was reading off it in front of them.  I am definitely coming back in the future since their seasoning of their skewers are delicious!",
