I have two major complaints now and I will never give them my money again- they are RACIST and DIRTY!  The DIRTY- I ordered my sub and waited off to the side. While he (manager guy who wouldn't give me his name- He's of Asian decent) was making my food, I watched him take his gloved hands, and wipe them on a rag that is on the counter, near the food line, and then touched my sandwich. I asked him what was on the rag, and he told me it's bleach water. I told him he's not allowed (in a previous life- I was a food manager and went through the food safety training) to wipe his gloves on the rag and then touch my food. He began to argue with me, and tell me that I'm wrong, and he's allowed, and that \"I can call the American Government and ask them\"- I did exactly as he suggested, well sort of. I called the  DC Dept. of Food Safety, because he's definitely not allowed to do this. I am not paying $10+ for a sub covered in bleach. Matter of fact, I'm not eating a free sub covered in Bleach, I'll pass on all of the bleach meals.  The RACISM: The employees here are of Asian decent, no biggie in my mind. I grew up in the DC area, we have an amazing blend of diversity, culture and variety. The majority of the population here in DC is African American, one of the things I love about our Chocolate City. However, on many visits, I've noticed the employees become rude towards these same people who ask questions, or need help. The most recent incident that comes to mind. I ordered my same sandwich, was waiting in line, and two African American ladies came in, came to the counter, and didn't know how to order. I could tell they've never been there, and didn't really know the area. Normally they have out their little order book where you can highlight or circle the sandwich options you want to order. It was close to closing time, so they took that away and were cleaning up. The ladies were trying to ask questions about the menu, and what they could get. The Asian man behind the counter didn't take the time to explain, acknowledge, or assist them in any way. He got irritated with them quickly and brushed them off. They didn't do anything at all to deserve this treatment. I've seen this type of behavior more than I'm comfortable with. I stepped forward and recommended they eat at another restaurant around the corner that didn't treat their guests the way this man was treating them, they agreed and left.  Never again will my money go to their pockets and I hope you chose the same!",
