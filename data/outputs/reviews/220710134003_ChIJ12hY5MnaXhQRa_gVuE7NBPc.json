He kept asking me if i wanted vegetables and I specifically said, only how it comes, not extra vegetables, just replace the beef with tofu. Of course when I get the food instead of Massaman curry I get some kind of spice-less sweet curry type vegetable mixture with like 2 pieces of plain tofu and rice. It was literally a mixture of canned vegetables like canned baby corn and canned mushrooms (gross) with pea pods and celery. Like what the hell is this? Plus, it tastes gross. Doesn't even taste like curry. On top of that, when they rang me up my total was nearly $20 for the order of lunch special curry and an order or spring roles (which btw were also disgusting and tasted like they came straight out of the freezer), when online the lunch special prices were less than what they charged me for each item. I pointed this out and he didn't even offer to refund my money for the difference. What a rip off. Nasty food made wrong on top of being over charged. I dont even know why I agreed to pay for my meal tbh. People, avoid this place and go to Sudkho Thai instead, its WAY better.",

Ordered a appetizer (spring roll) and a yellow curry. Extremely salty.  Sauce was barely edible with the curry due to the over salting and I didn\u2019t pick up any anything authentic in terms of flavor with the rolls.  It\u2019s in the city district, ok.   Attracts business people alike to come at lunch and I figure they don\u2019t like things too spicy or foreign to their taste buds.  But I was hoping to go in and get something ethnic and true to Thai flavors.",

It was completely empty upon entering which concerned us a bit about how our dinner would go. However we were seated and our drink order was taken promptly. We noticed they do ALOT of take out. Which made us feel better about our expectation of the food. I had she fish panang special with extra veggies instead of rice. The fish was very bland but the sauce was flavorful. He had the shrimp basil and said it was good but not super yummy. Basically I get why the restaurant was empty in the crowded NOLA downtown area, but I also get why there were tons of take out orders. The food is definitely take out worthy",

I have eaten here on three occasions either before, during, or after the lunch rush. Each time it was extremely difficult to get the attention of the waiter, even when the restaurant was nearly empty. Our water glasses were never refilled and the \"clean\" tables upon arrival were very sticky. The last time I went we sat in the nearly empty restaurant, around 1:30pm finished our food, and then waited with empty plates and glasses for 45 minutes. We tried several times to flag down other waitstaff not assigned to our table and were told that they couldn't do anything for us because they were not our assigned waiter. It was very unpleasant and we were late getting back to the office. But the food was delicious.",

There were also not as many veggies or pieces of tofu. As I'm eating, I notice a piece of tofu with a greenish tint - which is so NOT normal. I've had this plenty of times and never got an off colored tofu. Disgusting!! I want to throw up!! Singha Thai has lost my business for sure.",

The online photos of the interior look better than the real thing. The outside was low key. It's not trying to catch the attention of people passing by. I suppose it could be interpreted as having confidence.  Service: 3. I came after the lunch hour rush, so I didn't have to wait for a table, just someone to acknowledge my presence :-[  No one came  forward to greet me, so I started to wonder if I was supposed to seat myself :- The person who finally showed me to a table appeared to be the only waitress on duty, so I guess it was good that the bartender took my order.  He was attentive, accommodating about a side order,  asked what I thought of  the food, and didn't keep me waiting for my bill :-)  Food: 3. Don't expect the food to be sublime. It's basic no-frills cooking. The dish presented had no carved vegetables nor finishing touches. I've had better and worse. If you crave a taste of Thai, it gets the job done,  Value: 3.5 Pricing was fair for both the food and service.",
