Only complaint is about my most recent visit-- it was so difficult to get the attention of staff to order anything. We were ignored for so long, didn't get bread until we asked, then were ready for main courses after appetizers and had to flag the waitress down again. I don't know if they were a little short-staffed but they didn't seem super busy. Also, the crudo tastes AMAZING bu the amount of fish you get for the price tag is laughable, it's like 4 bites and gone. The giant lasagna makes up for that small portion. I'll be back though, just maybe not for the crudo!",

The food was incredible and the wine pairings perfect. The tiramisu was the best I have ever had. The service was exceptional. Maria got to speak italian and I was delighted by how comfortable the outdoor environment was. For eating outside in the dead of winter the heaters were perfect and all their servers kind to move them when asked. Overall 5 stars.

However, the smoked spaghetti was INSANELY good. I have not been able to stop thinking about it since I left. Just writing about it now is making me want to go back, and I probably will.

If you\u2019re an outsider, be prepared for outstanding Italian experience. LaRina has built a reputation that everything on their menu is a worthy consideration, you\u2019ll be taken aback with the very intentional care with each unique offering. The dishes are prepared with precision, attention to detail, and thoughtfulness; the proof is in each delicious bite. In regards to antipasti, the burrata is a rich, creamy and delectable starter. All of their pastas are made to please however they\u2019ve received a lot of attention over their smoked Spaghetti Aglio E Olio which tastes like your eating this dish fresh off a smoker. Unreal. The lasagna, is expertly constructed and the dance between the bolognese and the b\u00e9chamel offers a satisfying array of flavors in your mouth. The lasagna is great option for those seeking an entree on the heavier side as many of their pasta dishes are modestly portioned. For desert, I recommend the salted caramel Panna Cotta, the cool creamy finale is a refreshing way to end your LaRina rendezvous. One trip to LaRina and you\u2019ll quickly realize why there has been so much positive buzz in the neighborhood regarding their dining experience. Perfect option for date night or for a meal that will be extremely satisfying without blowing a hole in your wallet.",

Cute little spot, but tables are a bit cramped. Here's what we tried:  BURRATA $17 (basil pesto - ramps - pistacchio - grilled bread) This was VERYYYY good! The burrata was sooo soft, loved the consistency. The pesto and pistacchio were perfect complements to the burrata, super flavorful.  SPAGHETTI AGLIO E OLIO $19 (smoked spaghetti - garlic - olive oil - calabrian chili - hazelnuts) I was really excited for this item, but unfortunately it tasted just a bit undercooked. You could tell when you chewed on it and the fact that the noodles looked kinda broken in the bowl. I could see how this could be a standout dish, but it didn't deliver today. Pretty simple, no meats, really just garlic/olive oil.  MEZZELUNE $24 (blue crab - saffron bisque - chives) This one was really interesting, the bisque was nice and tangy which helped make the dish a lot lighter. There could have been more crab flavor, but there was a good amount in each pasta pillow haha.  PAPPARDELLE DI SEGALE $23 (beef short ribs - green peas - mint) yummmm probably my favorite. The pappardelle was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I wish the short ribs were more seasoned though, if you ate it on its own, you'd probably find it extremely light compared to the pappardelle.  Closer to a 3.5 star review, but not bad. On my next visit, I'd like to try the Lasagne Verdi. I've also heard great things about the artichoke app but it's no longer on the menu (bring it back!) ;(.  *FYI - do NOT go on a hot day...they do not have AC that is strong enough, it really felt mostly like the ceiling fans, which is completely not enough. They have a really cute outdoor seating area, so yeah...wait until it's cool out!",

Came back for my mother's 65th birthday with my family and we ordered two appetizers: the mission fig salad and fried zucchini flowers.  The fried food came out cold but, we let it slide.  We ordered everything at the same time and my brother's cold entree came out first (20 minutes after the appetizers) then my boyfriend's lasagna came 10 minutes later, then 20 minutes later my parents food came, and then 10 minutes later my pasta dish came.  So at no point did we actually get to eat together.  The waitress was pleasant but, did not tell us what went wrong and didn't inform us on the long wait.  Other tables were seated 20 minutes after us and were served before us.  I went in to try to talk to someone about how we were waiting to get the rest of our food (only 2 of 5 dishes were on the table) and a very rude server named Michaela said in the most condescending, apathetic tone that she had no idea what was going on with our food and that it was \"probably coming out.\" They comped our desserts and hastily gave my brother another drink at the end of the meal and charged us for the rest of our drinks and took off my pasta.  I've never written a restaurant review as I've also worked in the restaurant industry for a number of years but, this experience was truly terrible and stayed with me for days.  I live in the area and my friends were going to eat there after us but, we explained what happened.  They lost over 10 local customers based on the poor service and sadly, the food.",

Salad was delicious (raddichio heart w beet and beet puree) and the ravioli was probably the best I'd ever had. Pasta special was good but not my favorite.  Service was also very good.

The husband and I came here for what we thought would be a nice, quiet afternoon bite. We were greeted by a friendly employee who told us to sit anywhere we liked and brought us water and menus.  I wasn't very hungry so I was going to order an appetizer and husband ordered a main. I ordered the Asparagi and he, the Lasagna which was per the waiters recommendation. We also ordered a glass of wine and a cocktail.  The restaurant was fairly empty with a couple of other patrons there so it was weird that the drinks took over 5 minutes to come to us but we let it slide. But then when the food took a while to come too it became a little frustrating.  Anyways, food arrives and we begin to eat. The asapargi was OK. It was roasted asparagus with a poached egg, parm and some other blob of something cheesy atop. My husband was really enjoying his lasagna when all of a sudden he digs in and his fork catches a hair that was seriously cooked deep into the dish. I may or may not have gagged but ugh, you know, it's everyones worst nightmare.  We stopped eating and asked for the bill. When the waiter came back to the table we showed him the treasure we found and he was really sorry. He did take the dish off the bill and if it was anything less than a hair I'd give them more stars but I can't get passed that. It is unhygienic on all accounts and I don't know what else goes on in their kitchen.  I will not be returning anytime soon or ever for that matter.",

I could not decide what to order as everything sounded so good, and what  an excellent  wine and drinks list!!!! I had aubergine panzanella and buckwheat conchiglie with 'nduja, goats cheese and smoked aubergine. Delicious!! All paired with a lovely bottle of american wine. The service is top notch, friendly but still very professional. The place is pretty new, it opened about 2 months ago in a very nice area in Brooklyn within easy reach from Manhattan ( just 18$ from Midtown with Uber!!). The courtyard is absolutely beautiful, such a great atmosphere. What a place!! Well done to the young owners and all the staff. Keep up the good work. I will be back!!!!",

My husband and I had been waiting for Larina to open, walking by every couple days to check on their progress, curious to see what they'd bring to the neighborhood -- and after walking by earlier this afternoon, we'd learn LaRina would be open this evening & made a plan to check it out with a friend.  So glad we did.  Without question, LaRina is my favorite new restaurant in the area -- and among my favorite dining experiences worldwide (seriously folks, it's that good).  To begin, the decor is near perfect...a cozy mix of old & new -- considered, yet unfussy.  Nice enough to feel fancy, casual enough to show up in jeans.  LaRina's menu approaches Italian fare like  Alexander McQueen designed clothing.  As considered as the interiors & branding, Chef Silvia's creative menu avoids cliched, staid dishes (no spaghetti bolognese here) and instead crafts a new Italian -- a sophisticated yet accessible fare cool enough to impress your clients, relatable enough to keep visiting parents happy.  We tried three appetizers (a fresh burrata served with peanuts, a delicious cold beet & fig salad served with prosciutto & selection of fried pickled veggies) and decided to share a sampling of 5 pastas (all made in house) as part of a tasting menu chosen by the chef -- each completely outstanding in their own right -- and incredible paired alongside a house-made focaccia (the best way to scrape all the goodness from the bowls).  We finished it all off with a yogurt cake topped with a house-made fruit relish & fresh cream & an equally delicious biscotti served with a lemon ricotta custard.  Alongside a pitch-perfect atmosphere & top-10 meal came service that was both warm & enthusiastic -- clearly this team is proud -- and they have every right to be.  Their hard work has definitely paid off (and I hope it continues to pay off in spades) as you end up feeling like you've just spent the evening at an established favorite rather than the newcomer it is...making it my new favorite.  Welcome to the neighborhood, LaRina -- we're glad you're here.",
