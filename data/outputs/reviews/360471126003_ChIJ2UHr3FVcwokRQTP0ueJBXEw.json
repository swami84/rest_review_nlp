I would like to take my time and write about it, because I don't want you to waste your money their like I once did. Their food is not efficient at all; for fries they give the maximum of 17, for rice they give you an order that should be fed to an infant when you order large. Don't waste your money on that store it is not even worth one dollar from your pockets. If you cannot find a close chinese food store by your area check google maps.",

Due to the fact, that I did not see another Chinese food store i went there almost ever week and even when i told them put more they complained severely.
