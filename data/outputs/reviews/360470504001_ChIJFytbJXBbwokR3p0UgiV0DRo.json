Tacos were somewhat warm and my enchiladas had the tinga chicken which wasn\u2019t bad but I am not used to having them like that. We will probably go again and give it a second chance.

The reason I'm only giving this three stars is due to the very small portion of food provided for the family-style tacos that were advertised as being for four people. The meal was also advertised as including sides of rice and beans, but as you can see in my picture, they were very small condiment sized portions. There was also not enough of the meat for four adults. However, the food itself was very good as previously stated. Our waiter was fairly unattentive as we had to physically get up and go find him to get drink refills and more tortillas.  This place has major potential and I'm hoping to return soon!",

We ordered the small taco platter (for 4), which came with two sizable portions of meats and a tray of toppings - and FOUR tacos tortillas (they did bring more when asked). There was easily enough for 8-10 tacos. I wish there was a little more toppings, we ran out of creama pretty quickly, when asked for more they brought out a tablespoon worth. The kids meal, quesadilla, was actually a great value and looked great.  Service was quick, but pretty infrequent checks. Luckily it's a small space and you can stop them as they whisk by.  I'll go back in a few weeks.  Also nearly all the tables had \"reserved\" signs on them. And there were only 2 napkins at our table. At least bring a few more when the food comes, especially when there are kids.",

My husband is a chef in the Hotel Trades Industry so he pays close attention to every  detail. The service was fast and very friendly. The food was delicious and presentation was on point. Servings were just right and ingredients were quite fresh. The only thing I would say is that the quesadilla was not cooked to the crispy texture I prefer and the sangria could use a little more fruit like peaches and grapes. Other than that, we loved it. We were in and out in about 1/2 hour which I loved. Our daughter had gone previously so we decided to stop in. Since we live down the block, we will definitely stop in again. Love that you can walk in and order to go too. I look forward to them expanding the menu a little in the future. Overall, great to have them in the neighborhood.",

The homemade chips were extremely salty. We had to rub all of the salt off of them. The chicken tinga was pretty good, and I was excited to try the two vegetarian options, mushroom and rajas. Neither was great. Rajas taco was ok, but the mushroom taco really lacked flavor. We also got the steak bowl, which was very small, and the sour cream was on top of the tiny portion of meat, which made it hard to taste. We enjoyed the sangria, but it seems a little overpriced at $40/pitcher. Overall, very disappointing.",

Unfortunately no server was in sight so the bartender took our order, also greatly appreciated but then was no where to be found when the place got busy because he was bartending. When asking a different server for help we were told they can't interfere with other people's already open checks, so my boyfriend had to walk to the bar every time we needed something. Quite annoying. The complimentary tortilla chips were as hard as a rock - after speaking to the server, he said their fryer broke & they had to buy their chips which made no sense because they were soaked in oil as if they just had fried them? So are you buying chips and then re frying them? Two out of the three tacos I ordered we're not available. I'm not quite sure how you sell out of your food at 8 pm on a Friday night which is prime dinner time! The tacos themselves were delicious however they only use 1 tortilla so as soon as you pick up the taco they fall apart in your hands and the juice is all over you; this could most likely be prevented if they doubled up on the tortillas. $13 for a margarita that barely has any liquor in it - calm down Cena, this isn't the W Hotel. One thing I did like was that they're using portable kiosks for payment but the server stood there and waited until we pulled out our money to pay on the spot instead of allowing the customers to decide how they want to pay amongst themselves. What if you're on a date for the first time with somebody ... you have to make this decision while someone is standing right in front of you? He should have left and came back in about a minute, it was very uncomfortable. I really hope that they take this post as helpful criticism. We will come back in a couple weeks to see if they have ironed out these kinks.",
