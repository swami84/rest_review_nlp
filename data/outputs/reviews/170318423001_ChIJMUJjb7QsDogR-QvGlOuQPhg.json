They falsely advertised prices that were lower on their site than what I was charged, so I challenged the price of my order. They advertise \u201clunch\u201d prices on their full menu on their website and when I called they didn\u2019t ask for size preferences so needless to say I was a bit shocked by a $30 price difference. The women asked for my order back so they can take back the food and make it a small portion since thats the prices that are listed on their site(but not specified).  When I questioned if they were going to throw away the food and complained that my food would be cold by the time I got it home, I  caught them then reheating my order and putting the extra food back to serve to someone else I\u2019d assume. The woman said they weren\u2019t reheating, yet there was steam and flames coming out of the wok and she said they had to use that to reportion. I asked for a refund and the woman ignored me and then handed me the food back.  To add the food was mediocre at best and because of the price debacle, my food was hardly warm. I had the Mongolian beef and the beef looked questionable and all it had was onions and they were loaded with it.  I took one bite and threw it away.  The orange chicken was flavorless and more breading than chicken. The cashew chicken was the only thing that was semi decent.  Stay clear of this place. Poor business practices and horrible customer service.",

Good price for the amount of food and you can watch the chef prepare your food in the wok.  It is a small, quaint restaurant. Clean environment and friendly staff.",

Every other review is poor and surprise surprise... they complain about the same things i had a problem with.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!  Came in after seeing a \"soup & entree\" lunch special on the chalk board outside.  Sat down.  Was the only person eating in there.  The staff (including manager) sat around chatting not even acknowledging me.  After some time, the waitress realizes I'm an actual customer (some dude sat me and gave me a menu), and asks me if I'm ready to order.  I told her I'd have the lunch special with (can't recall which..) a specific entree and wonton soup.  She looked at me with disdain and said there wasn't a special that came with soup.  When I told her that there was, she got rude and pointed to some OTHER chalk boards inside, each with a different \"special\".  After explaining I had seen the special outside, she informed me that the deal outside wasn't a \"special\".  Whatever... I ordered the lunch described outside.  Food comes after a while.  No one comes by to check on me.  Had to ask for chopsticks.  Had to ask to get the bill.  Had to ask to get them to take my credit card.  Food was below average.  Super saucy.  Place also serves hamburgers and other american fare.  Not sure what this place is trying to be.  Told people in my client's office about my experience.  Everyone was like... Oh yeah, no one ever goes there; it's terrible.  Guess I have to agree.",

Upon delivery it smelled delicious, don't be fooled, this food is the bottom line stain of society. Before you order I suggest you call your doctor, setup your impending funeral because be prepared to receive animal testes wrapped in dough for fried dumpling and your dead grandmothers hair for lomane. They are lucky the lowest level I am allowed to rate is 1 star. My roommates and myself are currently on top of the hotel contemplating jumping due to the horrocious quality of garbage that was delivered to our hotel door.",

Hot and sour soup is neither hot nor sour, it's a thin liquid with a hint of stock/generic soup flavoring. First time I've ordered from here. On top of everything, customer service is just terrible!!! I will NEVER EVER EVER order from here again, I suggest that you don't waste your money either!!!!!   Avoid at all costs, the worst Chinese food I've ever had...",

I'm supprised that no one speaks chinese here, and wonder if it's the real chinese food. I ordered a small soup and regular chow how from lunch menu. The taste is ok, but when the bill came to me, they charged me for a dinner's price. I asked the owner, and she said that she made the order bigger for me!! Ok, without my permission, and no communication, and she ordered dinner for me for Lunch??? And please, it's just lunch's amount, not big at all. By the way, the washroom is very ugly and dirty. Any way, very disappointed with this place, will not come back any time.",

One of the most important things to keep in mind about this place is that some of the recipes may be a bit different than you're used to from typical Chinese places, but I've liked the twist on everything I've had here. For example, the General Tso's Chicken was different than I've had before, but had a great gingery sauce and tons of chicken and vegetables. The shrimp and lobster sauce is more traditional, while the egg rolls have a unique recipe, but have become some of my favorites. The chicken fried rice is some of the best I've had \u2014 lots of large pieces of chicken, a nice mix of vegetables and has a rich flavor. Portions are very large \u2014 I can typically get at least five meals out of two entrees. I would agree that the food does tend to be a bit on the saltier side, but I personally like my food saltier \u2014 and Yu Shan has been accommodating on allergy issues in the past, so it may be worth trying to request less salt. Delivery service has always been fast, with the food arriving very hot and much faster than the estimate provided. While I understand people expect certain things when they order Chinese food, it may be worth keeping a bit of an open mind and appreciating the recipes used here.",

Let me first say, even after living in Hong Kong and Shanghai, I'm still not an American-Chinese takeout food snob. It's never going to come close to the real thing, it is what it is. We ordered Crab Rangoons, Chicken Pot Stickers, Szechuan Green Beans, and Kung Pao Chicken.  The Crab Rangoons were very 1 note, not much flavor. Lots of wrapper, not much filling. Tasted slightly...off. The cheese seemed a little grainy. No sweetness whatsoever. Avoid.  Chicken Pot Stickers were cooked pretty well and had a good filling to wrapper ratio. The filling however...also very 1 note. I couldn't distinguish any green onion, garlic, or ginger. Almost like they just stuck ground chicken into the wrapper. Avoid.  Szechuan Green Beans came with a mix of other vegetables in a sauce. LOTS of sauce. Flavor wasn't terrible, kudos for throwing in some 5 spice, but the abundance of sauce killed it. A simple saut\u00e9, with szechuan peppers, garlic, ginger and shallots would do wonders for this dish. period. Until they change it, avoid it, like the plague.  Kung Pao Chicken...the only highlight of the evening, and I say so with a grain of salt. Calling it a highlight when comparing to the rest of the meal doesn't really say much for the dish. Lots of veggies, cooked well with a good amount of chicken. Flavor was nice, but the sauce! TOO MUCH! Also, try roasting the peanuts a little.  Will I ever order this again? Probably not. Not until I see some positive reviews. I should have read these in the first place and taken a clue. Silly me. Looks like I'm going back to getting delivery from Dragonfly Mandarin.",
