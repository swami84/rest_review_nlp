During in person, it would take at least 20 minutes to get my order even with mobile orders. Now that we\u2019re online, this place is usually pretty empty. I like to use mobile order so whenever I walk in they just completely ignore me. The staff are always gossiping and they never pay attention to their customers. They would always have my order ready on the counter but I cant ever get it because the staff ignore me completely. It takes at least 8 minutes for them to notice that I\u2019m waiting for my order. I find that some staff are pretty mean too. There\u2019s only like one or two people that are really nice and welcoming.",

The reason why I came here was because the library next door was closed. It seems like they have a thing for keeping the music loud like a concert hall!!  I've often wondered why they keep the music loud, because I'm sure it's not appealing for most people.  The good thing about this location is that it is clean and they seem to have more comfortable seating than other places. Finding a sest on the other hand can sometimes be a challenge depending on the time of day. Today I ordered a regular grande coffee, and it tasted alright. The service was adequate and it was fast. The hours here are not always consistent, and they may be different depending on the schedule of the university. Everything else about this place is great, I just wish that someday they make it more relaxing and quiet.",

I have been an advocate for individuals with Autism for years now and immediately noticed that there was a customer who was high functioning but non-verbal. He was growing impatient with the long wait, which was about 25 minutes to get a drink. I went up to him and asked him what his name is and what his order was, and he showed me his phone (it was a mobile order). I asked the barista if he had the order ready, and he said it was being made right then. About 2 minutes later, the man got his drink and thanked me with a smile and a handshake. About 2 more minutes later, he came back into the Starbucks and walked over to me and pointed at the sticker on the cup. He was pointing to the word \"warm\". I asked him if the drink was too hot, and he nodded. I got the attention of the barista again, and the man pointed to the sticker again to show him. AWithout any hesitation or questions, the barista swiftly remade the drink for him at the right temperature. The man was so grateful and shook the barista's hand and walked out of Starbucks with the largest smile as he drank his hot chocolate. I am amazed with the barista's ability to work in a situation where he has people yelling at him all morning for their order taking so long when the store is at maximum capacity and still have the temperament to handle a situation requiring his patience and kindness with an Autistic individual. This barista's actions are how every barista or server should respond to such an instance, but that often isn't the case. I don't think I can ever really complain about the wait again after this.",

After staring at her for a few more seconds she asked me what I wanted and when I said I wanted an apology she rolled her eyes and said she was sorry.

When there is a line in the morning, it tends to move fast.  The condiments area is always stocked with milk and sugar, and the bathrooms seem to be in good shape!  Also, I've never had any problem finding a seat inside.  Usually my thing is just regular coffee, so I'm not too keen about late and mocha drinks that they serve up.  Sometimes I do need the Cafe Frapacinno fix to get me through a hot summer's day.  All-in-all I like chilling there and I do manage to get Facebook work accomplished.",
