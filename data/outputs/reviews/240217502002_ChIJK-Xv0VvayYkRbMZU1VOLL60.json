We had reservations for new years and they called us back after we made reservations and told us that they would only have a set menu.  So no problem right? Well the 6 course meal was 100 dollars! Still not a problem, but they offered frog legs, and small dishes.  The gentleman who spoke to us who was the manager was rude and was more interested in selling wine for the night.  I can tell you we have personally been to wine kitchen over 20 times and refer tons of people to them, I think we will have to find a new favorite spot.  Not because of what they offered but because of the rude manger.",

This restaurant food is usually amazing and the staff is typically very friendly and eager to help those who may be newer to this level of dining.  On my last visit, while the service was above par I was less impressed with the food I have had in the past. This past visit I ordered the butchers special which happened to be lamb. Lamb is a favorite of mine if prepared and cooked correctly. Unfortunately the lamb fell short of my expectations.  In the past I have had amazing dishes here. And while I could tell the lamb was prepared with care whomever was cooking did not execute the dish as I had hoped. I'm sure I will be back as the food was still good. It was just not amazing as it had been in the past. Time and taste will tell if this was a fluke or the new norm for the wine kitchen.",

I find the food to be great, meanwhile the service is hit or miss--too expensive of a restaurant to have hit or miss service. We spent 10 minutes looking over the menu only for the server to tell us they were out of specific entrees AFTER my husband ordered one of them. Why not tell us when we were handed our menus?  Overall server acted as if she was going out of her way to wait on us. Not at all personable, never came back to ask how our food was or if we wanted more wine, and when she asked if I liked a soup (oh, how nice of you to care), I said it I didn't love it, explained why, and she came back and with a bit of an edge (although maybe this was just her personality) said that they only charged us for half of the cost of the soup. I had not even asked them to do this.  Everything was just off this evening. One couple got up and left, another table complained about their service as well. I'm in no hurry to go back anytime soon.  EDIT (sorry this took so long to edit) - owner reached out after I posted and sent a gift card and it was so appreciated. We've since returned and have eaten out with them several times during COVID to support local restaurants. As a matter of fact, just last night we carried out dinner. The chicken cassoulet was AH-MA-ZING. Thank you!",

The fried green tomatoes were quite good too. Be careful the first bite may be hot temperature wise.  Parking and finding the restaurant was tough. I parked in a massive garage near the library. Therefore the third floor on the parking garage. I paid $3. I could not see the restaurant from where I parked and I had to walk a waze to find the spot, which was a bit uncomfortable bc I did not know where I was going.",

We arrived on time and noticed that all the outside tables were taken.  When I asked the Host how long the wait would be he said and hour or more.   Before I go on I do want to say the the host was very polite and professional.  However, I did ask how can the wait be so long if I have a reservation.  He advised that they do not hold reservations for outside tables.   I was confused as I specifically requested an outside table.  He offered to get the manager so she can explain.    The Manager did come out and she seemed agitated and defensive during the discussion.  She falsely stated that the reservation sites (open table and google reservations) clearly state outdoor dining is unavailable.  They do not and I even went back to check to see if I overlooked this.  She stated we have never held reservations for out side, but I know that to be untrue as I have done this before and was seated outside immediately.    But more disconcerting the manager made no offer to make things right.  No offer to place us at the next available outside table to compensate for the confusion.  Her excuse was we did not notice your request.  We ended up leaving and cancelling our reservation.   To put icing on the cake her last sarcastic words to me were \"have a great life\".",

My wife and I have enjoyed this restaurant for any and every occasion over the past five years, and we seize any opportunity to recommend it to other locals, entertain guests, or just drop in for a quick drink or dessert.  The entire team here caters to every want - whether a specific request for a special occasion, a dietary restriction or preference, or an accommodation for a party - they will ensure you have a memorable experience coupled with the best food that Downtown Frederick has to offer. The menu offerings are flawlessly executed by Chef Jeff and his team, and the dining room is managed with the utmost attention to detail by John and Laura. As a Long Island native, I recommend the duck in any preparation that the chef offers. For wine, you absolutely cannot go wrong with any of the flights.  We look forward to many more memorable evenings with friends, family, colleagues, and your wonderful staff. Cheers.",

Knowledgeable in detail regarding drinks, menu items, specials and desserts!  It wasnt just our table, I observed him with others and he was checking in, engaging with the patrons, just frequent enough, but not over the top.  My friend and I both shared the mussels, ordered the fish special (amberjack, I believe from Hawaii), had amazing house special cocktail and had a wonderful peach special dessert!  The mussels were amazing and the broth preparation and garnish were different and so good!  The fish melted in our mouth. Cooked to perfection. The califlower vegetable was also delicious.  Honestly, this was the best fish, I've ever eaten and fish is my go too, since I dont eat meat.  Kudos to the chef, presentation and the food was excellent!  Kudos the pastry chef as well. Her desserts are not only beautiful, fresh ingredients, but taste amazing!! Save room!  The Wine Kitchen is a must, if you are foodie like me and enjoy a great meal and dont feel bad walking away paying for it too!!",

Overall the food was satisfactory.  We opted not to have dessert for the reasons below.  Bad:  Service was very slow and almost nonexistent.  From the time we went in,  it took 1 1/2 hours to be served.  My husband is a pretty good tipper.  He gives the wait staff generally 40% - 50% if there are no problems.  Instead he gave 20%.  I would have left 15%.  I would say the service was the biggest drawback.  We both do not want to return because of it.  The place is incredibly noisy as it is all hard surfaces.  We couldn't even have a conversation.  Noise is something they can't do anything about but was a deal breaker for me.  Wine is over priced.  Ugly:  Part of my view from my table was an open storage area and a coat rack.  Really?  A door would have been nice or even a curtain.  View also included a booth and at the end of said booth was an area below the seat that was painted white with dirt all over it.  This was a birthday celebration and it fell flat.  We will drive to Bethesda or DC if we must to find great food and service.  Hopefully we can find a great Frederick restaurant.  The Wine Kitchen on the Creek was NOT even in the ballpark.",

When the steak arrived I cut through to ensure it was cooked properly and clearly noted it was completely raw in the middle.  Requested the waiter to fix the situation and they took my plate away.  Shockingly, a few minutes later they brought back my steak which i cut into - instead of preparing a new steak, they simply threw my existing pieces back on the grill.  That is terrible - anyone who knows steaks, understands you cannot cook a piece of meat two times.  Given my frustration, I requested to speak to the manager.  Instead of apologizing, their stance was that the steak is still cooking on the way out to the table - this is NO excuse for serving raw meat.  Additionally, have they forgotten a steak needs to rest for several minutes before serving?!  It was absolutely terrible that they tried to defend their raw steak.  I had to tell the manager that I should\u2019ve gotten a new steak after being served a raw one - why should I be penalized for the chefs mistake for a $58 steak?  In the end, the manager did not even offer any reimbursement or to cover any drink or appetizer.  I wouldn\u2019t write a negative review but this is the second occurrence at this restaurant - the first time the waiter dropped an entire pitcher of water on my fianc\u00e9, apologized and again, no mediation or resolution from management.  Piss poor management at this restaurant - which I hope they resolve immediately for their own sake.",

Offered to change it out for us which we welcomed. However, we were told that we were mistaken. Sorry, I'm familiar with what oxidized wine is like. Guess I made a mistake ordering a red on a summer day... That said, they brought me a different wine and it was ok. Ordered one of the Salmon specials and a burger. The Salmon was ok, nothing special though and a bit bland. The burger was a bit over done. Had a new menu \"for the season.\" Didn't really see anything that we wanted and missed the old menu. Sad, as I knew I could count on taking guests to the WK. Well, as Meatloaf said, \"2 out of 3 ain't bad.\" Hope this was an exception, not the new norm.  Visited The Wine Kitchen again. Now using compostable containers for take home leftovers!!! EXCELLENT. Oh, and the food was delicious, again! Steak, duck, burgers, all great.  A limited menu, but in a good way. I had the pastrami sandwich. Was the best pastrami sandwich I've had in many years. Simply put, the food is fantastic. They also offer an innovative choice of wine flights. Fun to try a selection. Can't wait to try the rest! We'll surely return.",

They really were attentive and polite. The view was nice on the creek, but it started to rain so we moved inside. No available seats so we ate at the bar (not a problem for my wife and I.)  *Octopus - Beautiful looking presentation,  way overcooked and rubbery.  We eat this every place we can find it and purposely hunt restaurants that have it on the menu.  *Fried Green Tomatoes - Awesome! Some of the best I've had. Perfectly cooked and served simply.  Get these when you go.  *Filet - Excellent.  Like butter. Cooked perfectly.  *Scallops - Cooked perfectly. Great flavor. (Went well with the steak. My wife and I split the 2 entrees).  Drinks..  Despite the name I stuck with bourbon/ryes and they have a nice selection of Whistle pig. Prices are a bit higher than I'm used to seeing, but not totally over board.  We might come back. We might not. It's worth a try and their other food looked nice.. but I wasn't blown away and there are a lot of other options around to try before I give TWK another chance.",

We reserved a few weeks ago and used a gift certificate for a 3 course wine-paired dinner for 2.  Our highest complements to the daytime bartender, Laura,who poured us two glasses of Kava (sp?) to begin our celebration; the chef, Jeff Beard, for the delectable cuisine; our undying gratitude for being treated like royalty by the manager on duty,  Justin, who was our server;  and we have to thank the young man keeping our water filled throughout the entire evening as well.  Kudos to the Wine Kitchen on the Creek for giving us one of our best anniversary dinners to date!",

We didn\u2019t make reservations so they asked us if it was okay if we were done by 6 (it was around 4pm) due to Valentine\u2019s Day week. We should of known better but we were lucky! Our waitress, V, was fantastic! Beautiful girl and awesome personality (not just with us-she was great with all the tables around us). We had a Frederick mule and a pomegranate cosmopolitan to drink. Delicious! Mussels and beet salad as appetizers\u2014whoever thought of combining cocoa cardamom with beets is a genius of taste buds! My husband had the duck breast and I had rockfish and we both loved it! I often need to use salt&pepper shakers but I know why they weren\u2019t present at the table: everything was seasoned perfectly! My husband doesn\u2019t like sweets so I got the apple cake for myself! I\u2019m not a big fan of chamomile (it was topped with chamomile ice cream) but the combination of the ingredients made it a great dessert! Definitely will be back! And definitely will recommend to friends and family!",

I'm not sure if it was cold in every part but we were seated next to a window and all of our feet were freezing to the point that we had to bring our legs up off the floor to continue eating. Some of my party never took their jackets off.  We mentioned to our server and he was apologetic and nice but it wasn't something he had control over so unfortunately we had to push through it. I hope they figure it out during this cold winter but even though I enjoy their food I might wait until spring to visit them again.",
