Our server was Luigi, and I can't stress enough how great his service was. Super nice and funny and very personable. The burrata was divine. By itself, it's a very silky mouthfeel, and when topped with the honey and truffles, it unleashes the inner sweetness of the cheese. The bed of greens it lied on was the perfect earthy flavor to ground it and make sure it didn't become a cloying taste instead. I love it. We were also recommended dishes with porcini mushrooms since they are currently in season, and I was glad. The risotto I had was delicious. And of course, the tiramisu of Al Tiramisu is the smooth, creamy, perfect finish to the night.",

The Papperdelle mushroom pasta, chestnut soup, housemade limoncello, and Chianti were the highlights.  The complementary fluffy focaccia and rustic bread were tasty and served with olive oil and tapenade. Off to a good start!  Chianti (5/5) - Enjoyed a couple of glasses of Chianti over the bread and pasta. Perfect pairing of food with wine!  Zuppa del giorno Soup of the day (5/5) - The Chestnut Soup was creamy and bursting with flavor. Glad I ordered it! The bread was perfect for mopping up the soup. Worth ordering and saving room for.  Scamorza affumicata gratinata su crosta di pane con acciughe (2/5)- Bread smothered with cheese. Fun to try, but very rich and cheesy! I would save your appetite for the soup and main course.  Pappardelle Strappate Su Ragu Di Funghi (5/5) - The wide noocdles were cooked al dente loaded with tasty mushrooms.  Ravioli Di Caciocavallo Podolico E Foglie Di Bietola in Burro E Salvia (4/5) - Ravioli stuffed with burrata in butter sage sauce is a simple dish which my hubby thoroughly enjoyed, while I preferred the Papperdelle.  Sfalde Di Salmone Con Salsa All'arancia (5/5) - My hubby enjoyed the fresh fish.  Tiramisu (3/5) - Doesn't quite live up to the restaurant name. It was a bit dry and could use more liquor to make the dessert more moist and less dense.  Limoncello (5/5) - The house-made limoncello was a hidden gem, tasty and potent! Fun way to end a meal.  Highly recommend! Off the beaten path on P street, worth trekking over for a great culinary experience!",

APPETIZER: Burrata del Salento con miele e tartufo nero $18 burrata from Salento / local honey / black truffle bits *I was hoping the burrata would be really creamy and have lots of truffle flavor but the whole dish fell flat and definitely didn't have the creaminess of a burrata and barely any truffle flavor.  The slaw that came underneath didn't really add anything to the dish.  ENTREES: Maine Lobster Linguine *This was the best thing I ate and it was because of the lobster not the pasta.  The linguine tasted like box pasta, it didn't taste homemade, I'm not sure if their pasta is homemade.  The lobster was cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce was very simple and didn't overwhelm the lobster.  This menu item is usually listed on their daily specials and I would recommend trying this dish especially if you're a lobster fan.  You also have the option to do risotto instead of linguine.  Spinach & 4 Cheese Ravioli *Mostly pasta barely any filling, it was like sad deflated raviolis pretty disappointing.  You'll still be very hungry after eating this.  DESSERT: Tartufo al cioccolato Frozen zabaglione covered in chocolate gelato, hazelnuts and cocoa *this was pretty tasty reminds me of an ice cream version of the ferrero rocher chocolate. *I also opted not to the get the tiramisu because so many Yelpers mentioned it was small and mediocre.  SERVICE: Consistent throughout dinner no complaints here, water and wine glasses were always full.  The server verbally went through the daily specials, I wish they had them printed out just because there were so many to listen to and remember.",

My server, Luis, brought the main dishes out with the first dish, our pasta. The main dishes on the menu are clearly marked Secondi. When I questioned why he did this he said because we we're splitting our pasta dish. Ridiculous. So our main dish sat in the middle of the table getting cold while we ate our pasta.

The food was brought out way too quickly for it to have been made in that time, and prepared, heated food at this price is unacceptable. But the train wreck didn't stop there as the dish we were served with was literally tasteless. The bland food made me thankful for the fact that the portion sizes were laughably small. Obviously, our complaints have been made to the servers, but they didn't really seem to understand them. No compensation was offered on our bill either. They did offer desserts, although it wasn't made clear whether those were supposed to be the compensation, but it didn't matter, as after all of this, we had no intentions of staying there any longer.",

Tried it after the initial place were headed was booked solid with hours of waiting time. Immediately we were greeted at the door by 2 very friendly people and even though we didn't have a reservation, it wasn't a problem.  The food was amazing, (lobster linguine and blazed duck breast), with many specials for the evening off the menu as well. Service was equally amazing as they constantly checked in on us, had pleasant conversation and even spoke to our young son in a kind manor (even when he was acting his age once in a while). Al Tiramisu was a very pleasant surprise and I would completely recommend it to anyone who might have a chance to visit.",

He said do you have a business card and I told him only managers have cards at my property and I'm a concierge and I don't have one, but he can call my property and confirm. He kind of embarrassed me infront of my friend saying you could be anyone and didn't want to do any further thing for me. He should have responded in another way maybe saying unfortunately we don't have any discounts for anyone or another appropriate way.

Restaurant is rather small, and narrow; acoustics very poor and make it almost impossible to have a conversation. Upon ordering, appetizers arrived literally within a minute; obviously not freshly made but were fairly good, better than adequate. 1 of 3 dinners brought to table was wrong meal; waiter insisted it was what had been ordered, but because I do not ever eat what was served, no question and I told him to take it back. Waiter agreed to have the correct meal (red snapper) prepared, but after a long wait and after others in the party were through with their meals, and only after I told the waiter to bring the meal or cancel it, it was brought to the table (on an extremely hot plate!) It was at best a mediocre, and extremely small portion of red snapper. Then a large party was seated closely behind our table, and additional chairs brought to that table which necessitated my moving where I was seated. And finally, despite our very unpleasant meal, no accommodation was made or offered on the bill. I do not mind paying $400 for a $400 meal (for 3).  This was not worth it; not even close. This restaurant claims to cater to the rich and famous. They can have it!",
