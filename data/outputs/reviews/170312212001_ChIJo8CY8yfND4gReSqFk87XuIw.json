I was driving by this evening wondering if I should grab Subway real quick or support a local business. I opted for the latter and instantly regretted it as soon as I walked in. I did not get greeted or even an acknowledgement. As soon as the guy behind the plastic decided to stop having his back to me, he responded with a rude tone and not one friendly word to say. I work with the public all day for my job and I would be terminated immediately if I behave the way they did. Not very good food, even worse customer service. I will not being giving them another chance. Go elsewhere.",

Coal fire was our go to while downtown but now in Evanston so it\u2019s a bit of a hike. Been ordering from Jimmy\u2019s Cafe lately but wanted to try something new, and a friend recommended Dante\u2019s. Sadly it was not what we had hoped for. While we like our toasty crust to get a nice fold it was burnt in several places and that overwhelmed the taste. We ordered half bacon and while the cheese half was ok, the bacon side tasted off, primarily from the bacon. Was hoping this would have been another favorite, unfortunately it was a disappointment.",
