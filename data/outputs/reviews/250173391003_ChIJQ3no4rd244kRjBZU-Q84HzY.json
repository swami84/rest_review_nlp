Favorites are the Chicken Karahi, the lamb okra, the chicken tikka massala and the dishes with spinach... chicken or lamb palak. We find it hard to keep branching out with all these dishes we really like. Rice is included, breads are freshly made and very good. Patronize this place!

I ordered chicken tikka boti, lamb nehari and lamb biryani and all the three dishes were tasteless and awful.  The chicken tikka boti was dry and tough like chewing leather. The lamb nehari was tasteless and 1/3 of it was just oil. Even after specifically asking to avoid adding oil in the container. The lamb biryani was not good too.  I had ordered the last two items once before too and except the oil issue in nehari everything else was good. So decided to give it a try again. I don't know what changed but I won't take that risk again.",

I was a chef and worked in the food industry for well over 20 years tho so when I speak about food quality I know what I\u2019m talking about.  I ordered paneer tikka masala, garlic naan, and vegetable samosa to try this place out. My wife read an article that said it was the \u201cbest Indian food in Boston or the surrounding area\u201d and with that praise I had to try it. I was not happy to say the least. Let me explain why and also a little of what helps me write such a review.  Mind you I eat paneer tikka masala 5 days a week for lunch and have done so for the last 6 months and I frequent many Indian establishments in search for my perfect bite of paneer tikka masala I have come to love so so much. This place made the food quick and it came hot. Beyond that I have nothing else positive to say. The sauce was curdled and broken, greasy, and lacked any real flavor of garam masala or any of the wonderful spices I have come to expect. The only real flavor was grease. The paneer was not marinated in any kind of seasoned yogurt and definitely had no crust applied by pan searing. Instead I got cubes of paneer thrown in a hot pan, browned on one side and sauced with grease. The paneer was undercooked and had no \u201csweet garlic\u201d flavor that was mentioned in the menu. The samosa looked and tasted like they were left over from who knows when. I absolutely will not go back. I hope that anyone looking for good Indian skips this place and goes to Lexington instead because the place I go to there knows how to get down in the kitchen and if that\u2019s to far then stoneham has a good spot too. Do yourself and your wallet a favor and skip ZamZam entirely.",

Karahi was decent and so was chapli kebab. Our mixed grill platter had two tiny pieces of tandoori chicken in which one was a loaf of fat we couldn't break. One sliced chapli kebab that had no mention under the description of platter and lots of sliced seekh kebabs. They were all cooked from before and soggy. When we complained about proportion of chicken tandoori, the manager said \"its all chicken anyway\". When I told him how the grill is not fresh (which I am 110% sure that it was'nt cause we have a bbq machine at home and we know how fresh bbq feels like) he was swearing upon Quran that it was fresh. This was when I just lost it. If only he had not brought in the holy book for his false claims, I would have let it go. These guys are going to close down very soon if they dont serve better food. Will never recommend this place even after how he said in the end we don't need to pay after seeing our pissed faces.",

The spice hits you but the flavors are immaculate. I highly recommend their Tikka Masala and Karahi. If you are looking for a more spicy-tangy gravy, try their achari (pickle) gravy. About their kebabs.... not the best seekh, Chapli or tikka boti kebabs but very very close to the best I have ever had. My family just devoured all the kebabs. I am not a big fan of pakistani style biryani's however their shrimp biryani was surprisingly good, albeit a little different (as expected) from the indian hyderabadi style. We are definitely going back here!!!",

Food was excellent, nicely spiced and served with a lovely long-range rice. My daughter loved her mango lassi and my wife and I devoured our lamb korma and paneer Tikka masala. The only disappointment was the chai, but that's probably more a matter of us expecting something spicier. We'll be coming back again.",

It was Ok. We ordered the following: Biryani - 1/5 - was cold and we had to ask for it to be heated. It couldn't possibly have been made fresh. Chicken Tikka - 3/5 - was the best dish we ordered.\u00a0It was warm and flavorful. A little different than most Pakistani joints will give, almost a cross between \"Broast\" and Tikka. Saag Paneer - 2/5 - was ok nothing to write home about. Naan - 5/5 - were the saving grace along with the tikkas. Warm, buttery, and had a \"qulcha\" type feel to them. Really liked them.  Service/Experience/Atmosphere (1/5): South Asian joints aren't known for service, but even with those expectations the service here was pretty bad. Our orders were mixed up, we didn't have utensils. Food came out cold, indicating that it wasn't made fresh, and i had to approach the counter to ask for stuff instead of having the server come by our place (it is a full-service restaurant).  Overall: With a dearth of good south asian eateries in the area, we had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately we left disappointed. The food wasn't great and the service just added to the bitter disappointment. I hope they improve.",
