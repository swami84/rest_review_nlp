We had the stir fried rice with pork bits and garlic shrimp, the Khao Soo Gai (northern Thai curry with chicken and egg noodle), and the beef brisket Panang Curry, and they were all very delicious.

The stars of the meal were the grilled pomelo & shrimp salad, and the spicy chicken in banana leaf. Both had layers of flavor and brought a nice spice. An excellent green mango salad and a crispy pork belly on fried rice rounded the meal out. Dessert was a griddle cake and was addictive.  Such an amazing meal and a total bargain at $60.

A tip a good friend showed me... set your oven on the lowest warm setting and leave the Kanom Krok in the oven until you finish your meal. Comes out perfect every time. We love Baan Siam!

Their version of green curry is called \"Young Coconut & Chicken Green Curry\" and it's spicy (and good!). The beef panang curry is also spicy and tasty. If you like mild, the green mango salad is good and uniqe.  - Service: Ordering online for pick-up was easy and it was ready on time. When we picked it up, the staff were helpful and kind.  - Space: It's HUGE and beautifully designed. They have a sidealk patio for safe distance outdoor dining.  I recommend this spot for quality Thai food in Washington, D.C.",

You can't go wrong. Delicious food.  First, major applause for opening during a pandemic. Talk about having to deal with an unprecedented wrench thrown into the plans.  I ordered the northern Thai pork curry and the spicy chicken in banana leaf. I personally thought the flavors were out of this world. Truly phenomenal. I love spicy food and I was sweating after eating these at their \"normal, as ordered\" spice level. I loved it! I don't think there's another Thai restaurant in DC offering these kind of flavor profiles. I recommend both dishes as well as the pineapple chicken bites appetizer. All delicious.  Cons?  The food was a bit too spicy for my wife. We both thought that quantity for the price point was low (but this was Covid takeout). Also, they could stand to add more vegetables in the dishes as well as offer more interesting vegetable/gluten free dishes. Like a simple spicy eggplant tofu with string beans would be nice. More leafy greens: more broccoli, spinach, etc.",

The two standouts to me were the mango salad (made with ripe mango, not green mango... not sure if it's usually made that way but it was still delicious) and the spicy peanut noodles. The banana leaf chicken was missing acid, but had a nice amount of heat. Grilled beef salad was decent but not great, the meat itself isn't very seasoned, probably because it's served with such a salty-sour sauce. Wish it came with more veg as well. Overall this place is fantastic and you should definitely check it out. Excited to return.",

We got 3 items 1. chicken in banana leaf- it\u2019s a must try item order it without any hesitation. The chicken was super tender and the glass noodles along with it were very soft. The dish has an amazing flavor profile. It\u2019s not that spicy. 2. Roasted duck curry- this is another gem, very different than the Thai curries I had. Amazing flavor with lots of veggies and the duck was cooked great. It\u2019s a bit on the spicier end. Oh btw, the brown rice that came with this curry was out of the world. 3. Egg noodles- this one was different, not spicy but still had a unique flavor. I highly highly recommend this place. Fantastic job chef. Finding parking can be a bit of bother here..!",
