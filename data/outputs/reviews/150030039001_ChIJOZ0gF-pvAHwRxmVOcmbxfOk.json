Reading the signs I just had to explore it more and when I did I was hit by the massive amounts of food choices. Left Wing was my pick and their garlic chicken sandwich meal is a must get for those hankering an easily affordable, non-fast food chain chicken sandwich which is cooked fresh. I\u2019m planning on eating the menu in the coming months so this place is a definite must try!",

Have always ordered the boneless, but recently noticed they added a sandwich and don on the menu. Excited to try them soon! If you don't like spicy, maybe stick with the chili soy sauce or original...you really can't go wrong.",
