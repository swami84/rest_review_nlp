        "caption": "For starters, Pizza Policy\u2019s pizza is just the gateway to their menu. Daily meal specials (think meatloaf, tomato soup, etc.), salad and sandwich varieties, wings (they have Mumbo), desserts and more encourage your return for more. This said, make sure to comb their SPECIALS section(s) before going straight to their mainstays. On my short list for some time, I recruited my brother to truly flesh out... Our order (including a few pics with review):  The Oath *special pizza The Transfer *special pizza The Recess *special pizza Cheesesteak Cuban Grilled Cheese Pizza Grilled Cheese Fried Chicken Sandwich *special Grab-N-Go sandwich Parmesan Truffle Fries Tiramisu *limited special Pop Tart (Strawberry)  Yup, just the two of us and after having enjoyed each of these, there is no need to tease yourself by just ordering a pizza. OK? Ok.  The pizzas, although DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT from one another, shared one thing in common: quality ingredients you could taste. The Oath boasted butternut squash and kale propped up with roasted garlic and caramelized onion. The Transfer shared mild pesto, feta and roasted tomato with the bite of Italian sausage and calming mozzarella. The Recess, despite being a straightforward BBQ chicken pizza, retained a familiar, tangy sauce coupled with hints of red onion. All enjoyable and the last takeaway? Foldable. Do not get discouraged when you read \u201cthin crust.\u201d These aren\u2019t crackers like we have in the area. P. Policy\u2019s pizzas have just enough dough to tread that fine line and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased.  The sandwiches were good. Not bad. Not great. Good. Give a gold medal for that Fried Chicken one though. The cheesesteak (w/beef tenderloin) was clean and lackadaisically flavorful. Not traditional but I ordered a cheesesteak from a place called PIZZA POLICY (a W. Millar & Co. Catering project). YMMV The grilled cheeses (pizza and Cuban) were creatively memorable. The pizza grilled cheese was the standout here even though it was the most basic. The Cuban left quite a bit to be desired despite not skimping on fillings. Both were on thick\u2019ish sourdough. The Fried Chicken Sandwich is a cool/cold sandwich so be mentally prepared when ordering. I was not and my raised eyebrows definitely showed this. The order prepper goes, \u201cYour order is almost ready. I\u2019m going to grab your fried chicken sandwich out of the fridge.\u201d I should have asked in advance but this IS a Grab-N-Go Sandwich. My B. Nevertheless, the sando temp did NOT impact how good this MF\u2019ing thing was. Jicama slaw accompanied by tabasco mayo in between a pillowy, Brioche(?) bun. GTFO (that\u2019d be Get This F*cking Order)  Parmesan. Truffle. Fries. Oh, parmesan truffle fries get me every time. Pizza P.\u2019s doesn\u2019t hold back and will probably be a staple side order next time, every time. FWIW, they seemingly layered the parmesan in the bag and not just dumped on top like various other establishments.  Finally, we have the desserts I knew I needed to try. Their limited Tiramisu and their Pop Tarts. Cookies next time based solely on how good their pop tarts were, not the Tiramisu.  As a firm believer that local Pop Tarts have been on the gradual decline, PP\u2019s renewed my hope that not all is lost. My strawberry filled order came complete with a smooth, yet playfully flakey pastry outer. The first bite made me instantly regret not ordering more. Also, they have other, rotating flavors I\u2019ll be returning for so take note!  For the Tiramisu for 2, I came across this add-on thanks to their daily updated IG Stories (@pizzapolicydc). Since it was my brother and myself, it felt appropriate. This was light and direct. There were no strong or bold flavors. Nothing overpowering nor overwhelming and would be better accompanied with a glass of milk, not a wine or coffee. The VERY reasonable price reflected this and was a welcomed order, I just wouldn\u2019t recommend it is all.  So yea, 5 for Pizza Policy. I\u2019ll definitely be back to work through their pizzas, the occasional special and naturally, Pop Tarts. Now I think about it, it is about time for lunch\u2026",

The salads are also a great value and includes a healthy portion of the salad toppings (for instance the Greek salad had plenty of the olives, cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes and feta on the romaine bed).  Of course the pizza is also amazing but I love how much they have expanded the menu!",
