Our mimosa box eventually made it out at the hour point. I ordered the beni, was told they ran out of prosciutto and it would be crab cake and then it came out with sandwich ham on it. It still tastes good so I didn\u2019t send it back, for fear we would be there another hour.   Our waiter kept disappearing on us. It finally took about 30 min to get the check.

Tonight was especially busy and we all know that when it\u2019s slammed even the best of restaurants can fall short on service. That is definitely not the case here.  Shout out to Maria...She killed it tonight. There wasn\u2019t a single moment where I didn\u2019t see Maria busting her behind to make sure every little detail was in order. It\u2019s the details that turn \u201cgood service\u201d into a memorable experience, and Maria made that happen tonight! This women needs a raise and a promotion.",

Research between other options led us to the Riggsby\u2019s Fitzgerald Room. Events Coordinator, Stenise, walked me through final plans for our dinner party, from start to finish, on the telephone, and confirmed on email.She assured me that from the moment our guests arrived, our event would be taken care of and handled with the utmost care and finesse.  The day of our event, the GM, Adam and our head waiter, Kareem, assured us that we would be cared for and receive exceptional food, drink and service. The Fitzgerald Room was perfect for our twelve guests, with the candlelit table and background music. Kareem \u2018s personality lit up the room, and the wine and food selections were beautiful as well as delectable.  Everyone involved in the planning and execution of the evening are owed our heartfelt thanks. Not only was the evening special, the staff and location provided a lifetime of memories, not only for the engaged couple, but their parents and guests as well!  Five Stars!!!",

The menu is very diverse with excellent seafood and meat options for both starters and entrees. I wasn't very impressed by any of the starters that I shared amongst my party, but my entr\u00e9e was beyond excellent. Their Australian lamb chops is such a well-balanced meal. There's tons of flavor with a good amount of fat and acidity. I'd come back just to have this dish again. Service was also very friendly. It'll make for a pricey dinner once you add multiple courses and drinks, which I don't mind if I'm having an amazing dining experience. The Riggsby gave me 70% of an amazing experience, so I wouldn't deter anybody from giving them a try.",

The brunch menu, for example, includes duck confit hash. It's great, but is a far cry from corned beef hash!  Servers are friendly and efficient without intruding inappropriately upon conversation. They keep an attentive eye open for a customer's look or gesture and are quick to respond.  Prices are mid range, but not prohibitive. All in all, it is a delightful place to meet and share a meal with friends.",

Maybe he was having a bad night but we definitely had tension and he should have done something to alleviate it.  The dining room was loud and we had to ask about some of the offerings.  He was visibly agitated.  The table was not steady and he scolded us when we tried to tell him about it.  He never apologized for his behavior.  He dropped a drink and bumped into me a number of times.  Unfortunately the story of the evening wasn't the birthday, it was the rude waiter.  The hotel lobby, bar and dining room are all very cramped.  They do a good job with it, but it is not comfortable and I felt claustrophobic.  I don't think we will be back.",

        "caption": "The food here is outstanding and the service is excellent.  Several things about it are quirky, from the waiters that walk around just to put a piece of bread on your bread plate to a coat-check style take-home box system where they give you a ticket for your box.  My wife and I went with friends and tried a couple appetizers.  I am not the biggest seafood person outside of some basic things like shrimp, salmon, and crab, but the calamari here was really excellent!  I ordered the pork chop which was one of the best I have ever had.  It comes pre-sliced, though you will cut it up more, and then smothered in a great European-type sauce that includes spicy sausage, potatoes, onions, fresh garlic, and other ingredients.  It is spicy as were several other dishes.  My wife ordered the roasted chicken which I thought was cooked incredibly well and just outstanding.  A friend ordered the bronzino, which was a wonderful, smaller plate with a great green sauce and a well cooked piece of fish.  We save a little bit of room for dessert and no one could decide between three desserts, so the four of us ordered (though we failed to finish) all three--a brownie bottom sunday pie, rhubarb pie, and banana pudding.  I can be weird about creamy textures and am not a pudding fan, but the banana pudding was incredible.  I could go back just for it.  The strawberry rhubarb pie was outstanding and gave me a nostalgic feeling for home, down South.  The brownie sunday thing was really great, but so big and intense that you couldn't really get through all of it.  It was stacked so high you almost had no hope of getting ice-cream and the very-much buried brownie in one bite.  We were all very impressed as the just how good all of the desserts were--three swings and three hits!  On a final note, we all ordered drinks as well and the old fashioned there was just outstanding.  It was one of the best, top two, for old fashioned's I've had in the District.  Our waiter was also phenomenal--very attentive and great with a group that was prone to talking to him.  This place is expensive, but very much worth it.  I would go back for a special dinner, date-night, or a special occasion.  They seemed to be able to deal very well with bigger tables of people.  Hopefully this review will associate with the pictures I previously posted so you can see some of the items we had.",

I was staying at the Kimpton Carlyle in DC and, because of the weather, didn't want to venture out to find food. I checked the ratings on the Riggsby and was impressed, so I went for it. What a pleasant surprise! Excellent food, superior service--and all at a reasonable price (for DC). I'm not much of a review writer, but I'm motivated to tell people about this gem in Dupont Circle.",

We even had to take our bill to the hostess stand to pay because we were left there waiting for so long! The  food was tasty, but did feel we had to wait a long time there too.  Side note- we sent a review to the hotel and Riggsby and have yet to hear back from them...another disappointment.",

Going 0 for 5 is not an easy feat, but the Riggsby manages it without batting an eyelid.

Dishes were replaced, only for us to wish we toughed it out with our previous selection. By the end of the evening, my wife decides to throw caution to the wind and got tipsy. I'd like to say she started to enjoy her food, but at least she started seeing the funny side of their veal. And their deviled eggs. And their sea bass.  Edible if you don't mind not having sex that night because of the unpleasant burps that hark back to the veal. Cooked in what I assume was fish oil. Veal. In fish oil. Seriously.

        "caption": "Absolutely superb place! Great ambiance/decor, exquisite food and service, and, most importantly, it is way better than Lupo Verde (they are super rude, don't ever go there).  The drinks were unique and great tasting. Brunch menu hit the spot; perfect for our Sunday morning woes. Natalie, our delightful server, was great. Bloody Mary, something I am very picky about, was beautifully made. We used DC-made gin instead of vodka. I hope the hipsters doing ruin this place*.  While we were there for brunch, the bar seems like a perfect place for the end of your 17th Street, Saturday night fiesta. This place will help you deal the deal.  * - Hipsters: go to Lupo Verde on 14th Street. I highly recommend it for you.",

I've even ordered the goat cheese cheesecake to go.  The food is delicious American.  One time we just ordered half the appetizers on the menu because we couldn't decide on an entree.  The staff was friendly and made us feel relaxed and appreciated.",
