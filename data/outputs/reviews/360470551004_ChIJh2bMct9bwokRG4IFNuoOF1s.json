I had the brisket and the pulled pork. Brisket, mind-blowingly delicious, oh that flavor, that tender meat. Delish. Swoonworthy in fact. However, the pork was just meh. Instead of birthday cake, I chose to get their pecan pie. Sweet Sam Houston, yee ha...excellent pecan pie. The cornbread was adorably served in an individual rectangular pan and that honey coating was amazeballs. The cole slaw was awful, in taste and weird texture. The 4 stars is because of the lousy cole slaw and the lack of chicken. Boo. But brisket was fantastic, really worth a return visit. Oh and the pickles were fantastic and also worth a return just for those thin, sliced pickles!",

One thing here kills me though: the lack of sauce. I get that any pitmaster in Texas will tell you that brisket should be had sauceless. That said, having been to a broad swathe of the Texas barbecue scene (Franklin's, Louis Mueller, Killen's, Kreutz Market, La Barbecue, Pecan Lodge, Salt Lick, I can go on...) with the exception of Kreutz, they all serve sauce. In Kreutz's case, it's a matter of tradition (it's a 100+ year old spot, but even they serve sauce at their newer branch). For Delaney, it just comes off as an affected and cloying attempt at authenticity, and worse, disregard for the customers. At the end of the day, sauce is delicious, tradition be damned, and while Delaney is good (maybe even great), it's not too good for sauce.",

When food came out, I asked for BBQ sauce...it was stated that the sauce is in the meat and the owner learned from pit masters in Texas and that sauce isn't real BBQ. Wait I'm from Texas and while yes great BBQ doesn't need sauce it kinda goes hand in hand just like you would expect cornbread or white bread at a BBQ joint...all in all I wouldn't go back for BBQ and this place doesn't have 1 high chair in the building, maybe it's a New York thing",

The last time I went there we weren't too happy with the way they portioned the slices and the service wasn't very good at all we had said we weren't even going to go here again. We decided to anyway and today was different. Today I had discovered a bug on my empty plate and watched it crawl off. I notified the waitress and asked for a new plate I didn't really care about the bug and wasn't going to leave because the brisket is that amazing. And we fully expected to pay. The waitress then told us she was taking 30% off we were more then happy with that and then gave us a slice of delicious chocolate pie on her as well. As we got the check I guess she told the manager the situation and then she came back and said the whole meal was on the store. We were shocked honestly cause the 30% was fine but they exceeded our expectations and just comped the whole meal. Now that's customer service. They completely redeemed themselves and I will definitely return for brisket again. Love this place!",

In mid-June, my partner and I took my parents out for their anniversary.  The restaurant was trying a new dish, Fried Chicken.  Unfortunately the way the chicken was prepared and fried out in the dining area made it very uncomfortable.  My mother and I both were so teary eyed that we had to step out in front of the restaurant multiple times to get fresh air during dinner and rushed through the meal because it was unbearable.  The manager, Angela told us she was going to send my family a gift certificate for all of us to come back and have dinner after the Fried Chicken season to make up for this evening and let BrisketTown redeem themselves.  We didn't receive the gift card until mid-August and it was for $75.  When we were there in June, my partner and I spent $130 for 4 people.  How can $75 cover all of us to come back for a redemption dinner.  I contacted management again and this was the response I received from the bookkeeper, Tamikka :  \"In every respect, we understand your deep annoyance during your previous visit and your dissatisfaction with the $75 gift certificate issued to compensate for the meals eaten during that visit, however, we feel the gift certificate adequately compensates for the meal.\"  I am very disappointed that this restaurant believes they are adequately compensating me for a 4 person meal that cost me $130 in June with a $75 gift card now at the end of August.  I waited all this time since June to write a review with the hopes of BrisketTown following through on their original promise, but unfortunately I am left to write the truth, which isn't as positive as I hoped it would be.  Sharing my experience; hoping yours won't be the same if you choose to dine here.",

The last time I was in NYC, I visited Hometown Bar-B-Que in Brooklyn. It was a toss-up between Hometown and Delaney Barbecue last time so this time we were heading to Delaney. It is also known as BrisketTown. Owner/pitmaster Daniel Delaney learned his craft from one of Texas' best Wayne Mueller of Louie Mueller Barbecue.  When we got to the address of the restaurant, I was like where is it? You would have not guess a barbecue joint was there. They smoke the meats off-site. Amber, my sister, and a friend of college, and I were going to do the Meatfest, but they were out of the hot links. Instead, we got two pounds of moist brisket, a pound of pork ribs, and a half pound of pulled pork to share. We also order sides of collard greens and macaroni and cheese.  The brisket had a simple rub of salt and pepper that you often see in Central Texas. Phenomenal. That is my description of it. It rivals some of the best in Texas. The smoky meat was so tender. The flavor and texture were on point. The pork ribs were solid. You can taste the sweetness from the molasses coming through from the rub. It had a nice clean smoke taste but was a little chewy. The pulled pork was outstanding. It was smoky and juicy. It also had a sweet undertone. I ate most of it because I could not stop. The macaroni and cheese was the best I ever had. It was rich and creamy. The choice of pasta and cheese with the jalape\u00f1o kick made it out of this world. You cannot order this dish to-go. I could see why. They would never have enough of it available. I did not try the collard greens. The house-made pickles and potato bread were a nice added touch.  I give Daniel Delaney a lot of credit. He came to Texas to learn from the best. He made Delaney Barbecue into something legit. I eat bad and average BBQ often so when I come across a place like this, I am delighted. During warmer weather, Delaney serves up 'cue on the High Line at the location known as the SmokeLine. So far my barbecue experiences in the NYC have been great.",

The pulled pork was so overly salted that it was painful to eat. I should also note, as the bride, that was all that was available to me by the time I had a chance to eat. The plates they promised us were never made and I had to have a friend make us our plates, only to be told that the pulled pork was all that was left. And that was a lie too!! My groom found the staff packing up food that guests had been told \"we ran out of that\" (food that was supposed to be packed to go for us because we had paid for it). The biggest issue we had is one that should NEVER EVER happen with a professional catering team. The staff drank from our bar, and not just a drink or two..... there were a few of them that were flat out drunk by the end of the night. They didn't even try to hide it!! They drank with our guests and allowed our photographer to take pictures of them ALL taking shots!!  After going to Dan with the problems we had with the staff, he told us that he was very sorry and due to our wedding they had put some new procedures and rules in place that would prevent that from happening again. (As well as denying us a refund) That was not good enough, I don't get a \"do over\" of my wedding, so at the very least I hope this review prevents another couple from having the same terrible experience on their big day. We anxiously await the day that your wedding catering services has its own google page to write reviews on, because we have lots and lots of friends and family who can't wait to write about the experience at our wedding.",

Brisket was dry and salty, pork ribs were hard and salty, pulled pork didn't do a thing, the turkey was just okay, hot links were greasy! Collards were so salty I'll have to drink water for the next month just to get it out of my system, the potato salad \" I don't have words to describe how nasty it was! The saving grace was the $4 root beer my daughter had! I'm glad I didn't come for my birthday as I had originally planned! Texas BBQ? Do yourself a favor and stay far far away! Il never ever come here again. I'm posting this as I sit here. For those that will go by all the 5 stars don't be fooled either they are friends of the owner or their palates are so shot they couldn't tell what they ate! I stand by my review! I will say that the bartender was very friendly and so was one of the wait staff, we didn't have him as our server but I heard him explain the menu much better to the table in back of us. He did refill our glasses a few times and was genuinely concerned if everything was fine!",

I found myself there on a Sunday afternoon, just before they ended brunch service.  The space is cool, but odd, primarily because the lighting transports you to the 50s or 60s.  The servers/service is fantastic and the menu, while limited, is a tad expensive given the non-Manhattan location.  We had the brisket and coconut cream pie, which were both great.  The brisket had some moments of perfection, but was not consistent throughout.  I'd still come back, but the location is far from idea for us city-dwellers.",

After studying from the masters, testing and refining the process through pop-up BrisketLab events, and a sellout crowdfunding campaign, Dan Delaney finally opened his smoked meat home base in Williamsburg.  A tiny space it is, where the man himself can often be found at the counter dispensing the goods.  After a stop to grab some communal white bread, pickles, and onions, jostle your way to a seat (if you can) and the world melts away as the peppery, smokey, beefy brisket melts in your mouth.  Realize you ordered way too much and take the delectably greasy leftovers home to enjoy as a late-night sandwich or in a decadent breakfast hash.  Or come back to Delaney's for a breakfast taco (soon to be featured in its own popup TacoTown).",

She told us to remain on line, go to the counter, order our food, and she promised we would have a table to sit and eat dinner. The only thing left was brisket. Oh, we were elated. We order a pound of brisket: half juicy, half lean. We ordered potato salad, chili, and collard greens. You could make your way over to a small jar of assorted pickle slices, sliced onions, and potato bread. There is a choice of red or green hot sauce. The brisket was out of this world. Very juicy. It melted in our mouths. The outside had just the right amount of spices: pepper, a little bit of red pepper, salt. Perfect. The chili is made from brisket and pork ribs. The potato salad was not the usual fare. A little tangy. The only thing missing was Russian dressing. Prices are moderate. You serve yourself. The counter staff was extremely friendly. Great place.",

I stopped by the other day and tried a brisket taco and bacon taco and between the fresh onion, cilantro, egg and a bit of spice I was set for the rest of the day. A solid meal, well prepared and the guy at the counter was super friendly, it was like we were old friends even though we just met.",
