We had our two children here and were a bit nervous at how they'd behave in this restaurant. Fortunately the staff understood our elevated stress levels and did everything that they could to expedite & elevate our dining experience. We were immediately greeted by the busboy who had childrens water cups for us.(thank you!) Then the server was fantastic getting us in and out as most parents would appreciate and hope. the team here anticipated our needs even before we asked! I stood up to take my son to the restroom and again the busboy came up to us and shower us the way.  The food was actually very delicious and my picky little eaters enjoyed every minute of it. The in house margarita was fantastic and perfectly timed during our visit. I would certainly come again!",

Two things that are afterthoughts at a lot of restaurants, water and bread, couldn't be executed better anywhere else.  Their fruit infused water is cold and refreshing and is perfect to wash down their incredible food, if you're not getting the Thursday night $6 sangria special, of course, and the rolls they serve are hot and delicious with a garlic and herb infused olive oil that I would literally shower in, it's that good.  I usually get one of their delicious salads (they have several salad options and all are amazing +$6 bucks for steak added is definitely worth it) but any of their pasta dishes has also been exceptional.  The atmosphere is cute.  Darker woods and earthy tones dominate the scene and set the stage for a romantic date night in the dining room, or just a night of Al fresco dining with the doors open on the bar side.  Do yourself a favor and check out a hidden gem of the Lincoln Park neighborhood. You won't be disappointed.",

We sat in our booth for over an hour after we finished our meal while our 4-year-old son napped, and the staff was extremely accommodating (we had just flown in from SC, and he was exhausted). We were met with the kindness we needed after a stressful morning! There are also plenty of vegetarian options. It will be a new go-to spot for my family when we visit Chicago.",

        "caption": "We were looking for an affordable place to have dinner along Clark St, and even though there were a plethora of choices, we settled on Basil Leaf Cafe, with one of the deciding factors being that it was really close to the bus stop and we didn't feel like walking too much that day :)  I had the Linguine Meatballs and it was superb both in terms of quality and quantity. The meatballs were quite big by normal standards, plus they were really well done. The meat was tender and juicy, not overcooked. The outside was slightly crispy and the inside moist. The linguine was also nicely done, not overdone so that it tasted mushy, but cooked just right so that it had a full body of flavor and texture. I asked whether they made their own pasta but unfortunately, they did not. Nonetheless, they did a good job of cooking it.  The atmosphere is perfect for a quiet conversation, or a romantic night out. It's cosy, with warm lighting and wasn't too crowded when we were there. The service was also quite prompt, with my requests attended to quickly. I personally liked the bread that they served as starters as well, coupled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, it was a great start to the meal. The bread was warm, freshly baked, just the way I like it.  If you're looking for some affordable Italian fare along Clark St, this should be one of your options.",

The decor is charming without being overwhelming, the service is decent, and the food is deliciously light and fresh. I'm an especially big fan of the salmon Caesar salad. The fish is crispy and perfectly cooked every time I order it. If you're in the area and you have a craving for some simple, no-frills Italian, this is the place.",
