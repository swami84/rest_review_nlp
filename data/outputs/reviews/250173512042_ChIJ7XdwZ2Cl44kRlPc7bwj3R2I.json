To start, I called up and asked about different items and what the pickup procedure is, and the woman who answered the phone was so kind and warm.  Later that day, ordering on the phone was easy as can be. The food was ready and waiting before we even arrived; it was greatly appreciated that the staff actually waited to make the drink we ordered so that it didn\u2019t lose its quality just sitting on the counter. How many places put that much care and attention into their orders?  The food is superb. It\u2019s just amazing how many similarities there are between different spices and different dishes between cultures, and to try an Egyptian version of all these nutritious dishes was such a wonderful experience.  Earlier in the day, we experienced such an infuriating mixup with a vegan-friendly spot in Boston that served non-vegan items they assured us was vegan; so when you are seeking guaranteed vegan food, provided by a tremendously warm and friendly team, at a high quality and incredibly affordable price, you absolutely must come here!",
