We also tried the dumplings, \"fries\" and the cheese balls. All I can say is...we couldn't stop eating even after we ate everything in our main dishes. I would absolutely love to go back ASAP.",

Highly recommend the pork belly (spicy with sauce on the side is \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc) and the KFIRE spicy chicken. The soy/ginger beef is also amazing. Always made to order but incredibly fast and never had a bad experience after ordering from here 10+ times. You will regret not giving this great Korean spot a try. I always go for the delicious kimchi and pickled daikon for sides because they are honestly some the tastiest veggies I\u2019ve ever had and I don\u2019t like veggies haha. Kimchi honestly could use a little more spice maybe but the flavor is delicious and not overpoweringly salty like some kimchi you get. Honestly everything is good. Go try it now!",

There\u2019s something for everyone here: meat lovers?  Check.  Vegan? Check. Kids menu? Check.  I had the pleasure of eating here with wife and kids twice since their opening and I\u2019ll be headed back again soon to try more of the menu.  Another bonus is that Kfire is conveniently located near the highway and street parking is readily available so traveling from the suburbs has been a breeze.",
