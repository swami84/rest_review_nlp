One arepa paired with the yucca fries is a solid meal. But you don\u2019t have to stop there.  My partner and I took an order of tamal home to split for lunch the next day, was also really good! We kept it wrapped in the leaves and reheated it by steaming it.  I will be bringing friends here whenever they come to visit me in Williamsburg!",

My favorite arepa is the quinoa with beef, stacked all the way with all the sauces and fixings. I always feel at home with palenque. And I highly recommend bringing home frozen quinoa arepas. Such a great option for when your fridge is empty and you want to eat healthy. Buen provecho!",
