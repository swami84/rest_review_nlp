We had to ask for menus for food. When she took our order she never asked how we wanted our eggs or which options we wanted and was just rude like we were an inconvience to her standing around. After over an hour of waiting for our food and I asked her if she could check on it her response was we are busy if you didn\u2019t notice. And we did notice  at the fact there was an entire new group of people around us with their food and we still didn\u2019t have our food. She continued to make smart remarks and I left they then proceeded to call the police on my 64 year old father and said we were threatening. When I asked to speak with management they were young and dumb with nothing to say. Worst experience of my life and we definitely won\u2019t return to the hotel or their dining.",

Stupid folks, wedding parties probably come in and need the tone set.  My wife is a born/bred suburban chick so she thought the bartender hated us. We chatted with him a bit and once he realized we were not douche-bags he treated us like returning regulars. I'd definitely go back, I'd love to see how they deal with real A-Bags! :)",

The host stand at the hotel entrance was the only one open and the hostess was busy, so it took us a few minutes to get seated. The hostess got us water immediately and we then waited close to 20 minutes for our waitress, Elizabeth. She was one of two waitresses with a decent crowd for a Saturday night. After taking our drink orders, she brought one of our party the wrong beer and didn't check back with us until it was already too late. She did split the checks for us, but rolled her eyes and scoffed at my tip. I can't comment on the food, but the only reason this didn't get 1 star is because it does have a good beer selection. I definitely will not be returning to this place ever.",

We enjoyed the Jumbo Pretzels and Chicken Wings as an appetizer. The pretzels were good and came with both a cheese sauce and house-made dijon honey mustard dip. The chicken wings were underwhelming - baked and encrusted with what could be described as kin to barbecue potato chip crumbs - however I may be missing something more refined palates would enjoy. I ordered the Wild Mushroom Bisque as well as Fish and Chips. The Bisque was tasty, quite enjoyable, however a larger serving would have been liked for the price ($8). The Fish and Chips were delicious, fried perfectly and lightly, however there was too little house-made tartar sauce provided for my tastes. The fries were unmemorable and I did not finish them. Overall, the atmosphere is comfortable and is perfect for meeting lunches and other outings. I would not personally visit again due to the prices charged for what you get.",
