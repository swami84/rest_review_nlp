The interior was super clean. I loved the fact that they attended their customers by first name. The empanadas are a great price ranging from $2.50 to $3.50 (specialty empanadas). The chicken empanada was very moist. My favorite was the shrimp empanadas! Love that we could order online. By the time we got there, our order was waiting for us! Can\u2019t wait to go back and try other flavors!",
