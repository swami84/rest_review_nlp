I placed the order at 7:10pm. It was scheduled to arrive by 8:30pm or so, which seemed like a long time, but we decided it was worth it. At 7:29 the tracker said the pizza was cooked and was being inspected. By 8:30 the tracker had not updated, so we called the place and were told \u201cSoon, soon\u201d. By 9pm we still didn\u2019t have our order and called again. The man said the driver was on the way. At one point the tracker said he\u2019d arrived but nobody was there. It got to be 9:45 and still no order. We tried to call again to cancel but nobody answered. At 10pm we got a call from the driver that he was outside, but we didn\u2019t see anyone through the window. We told him it was too late, that we\u2019d waited almost 3 hours and didn\u2019t want the order anymore. The tracker then said \u201cOrder complete\u201d even though we refused the order.",

I came in and waited in front of the counter to ask for a menu and even though multiple staff members walked past, none acknowledged me. It took 10 minutes to get a menu finally. After deciding, it took another 10 minutes until I finally left because no one would come to take my order. Other customers were waiting behind me. Another customer came up next to me and asked staff for a menu and without even looking up, they said, \"no we don't got a menu.\" Why wouldn't Dominos have menus on hand?? I tried again to say I hadn't even made my order yet but the staff was simply not paying attention and so I just left after wasting 20 minutes there. I'm not saying anyone should be let go because everyone deserves to make an income, but it's so clear the staff absolutely does not care at all. They need serious training.",

Being specific I found out if you're disabled, live in an apartment building and want your order delivered to your door no matter if you are in an elevator building.....the deliver guy will not deliver it directly to your apartment. The delivery person will  only remain downstairs in the vestibule of a dwelling. If you're alone and have no other person to call upon to get your delivery.....you are screwed. Be ware if you're layed up in bed and make an online order. This had to be written for those who are homebound and incapable of going downstairs to pick up their order. I write it as there's no documentation of this rule and you'd be surprised to find out after the fact.",

After an uncomfortable exchange with the delivery driver staring at my girlfriend as she took the pizza out of his bag for him. She had to get a pen to sign her receipt. She felt bad that he had to walk up the stairs because he seemed off. So, she tipped him generously. He then proceeded to text her phone and tell her about his spiritual massage YouTube channel on which he frequently massages women's butt's in public. Instead of apologizing, the manager (I did not get her name) said that it's normal to hand out business cards. No. It's not. If any of my employees ever said that to one of our customers they wouldn't have a job. she neglected to apologize, or even offer a modicum of compassion. I followed up with the district supervisor (Islam). He did nothing. I reached out to customer service and they referred me back to him. Nothing has been done, and it's been weeks without an apology or compensation. If you like sexual harassment and uncomfortable exchanges this is the Domino's for you.",

That being said , none of this is a reflection upon the delivery drivers or the employees in general. I think the manager or dominos is dictating the portions they put on.",

If you liked it before, you'll probably like it now.  And if you liked it before, you should search for pizza, and find some with higher ratings, because they're better.  The sauce tasted vaguely improved from what it was, and that's about it.  Also, there's a delivery charge apart from the tip.  Really?  The terrible awful Papa John's has a stupid delivery charge too.  I guess all those places that talk about free delivery are actually saying \"We're better than Domino's and Papa John's!\"  Great.  The delivery guy was sort of dumb, though the online delivery that they have is actually cool.  And the pizza was edible, just not something that I'd ever choose.",
