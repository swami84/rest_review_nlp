In each of the large containers of curry were FIVE PIECES OF CHICKEN!!!!! We are aware there is a meat shortage, that's why we did not order beef or pork, we were trying to be mindful and get a cheaper meat, but I'm sorry, I've never been so skimped out when I spent $40 with tip. When I've eaten at like China Dragon, theres so much chicken, we usually have left overs, and while I definitely don't expect that of other restaurants, FIVE medium sized chunks of chicken in a 16 oz container is really pretty bad. I thought the curry was good, the soup was good, but that was pretty ridiculous and left a bad impression on us, as new customers. I am half Thai, and have been looking for an authentic place close by to be a regular customer, but this was a bad first impression. We wish you and your business all the best, but come on, I can't pretend that this is ok!",

Not only this but I've made a lot of these dishes myself.  To me the first thing I always check out from a new Thai place is the pad thai.  I am of course more than willing to come back again to see if perhaps this was just an off night.  But the pad thai was extremely bland. There is no sign of the quintessential pad thai sauce that gives it its flavor. In fact when I took it home I had to put in my own pad thai sauce which I keep a bottle of in my fridge.  Also the eggs were cooked separately which really you need to cook the egg in with the noodles it's part of getting the flavor to mingle in with everything else which just doesn't occur when you cook it separate.  I would highly recommend marinating the tofu a bit more possibly?  I'll admit the price is actually pretty nice but I would actually be willing to spend a dollar and a half more for a bit more taste.  I'm sure this place is probably fine with folks who don't have as much experience with Thai food but if you are a bit of a Thai food nerd you may find this place lacking in flavor.  It could have been enough night though? I think I will probably come back here at some point to check it out again and if it's gotten better I'll gladly edit my review. Because living in Pilsen it's the only Thai place around unless you go over to Chinatown.  So far though the best Thai places I've had are hands-down mostly on the north side.",
