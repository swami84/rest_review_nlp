Received email and text confirmation. Food never came. I want in a rush but I waited 2 hours so I called back and the lady on the phone was extremely rude.  Kept telling me that they don't have online ordering, only over the phone. Which is clearly incorrect. I got off the phone so I could give her my confirmation  number and call her back. Very rude again. Then someone went in and cancelled my order thirty minutes later to save face. Which I have screenshots of. Won't be ordering again",

So glad I did. I ordered the steamed potstickers, an egg roll, and the Dragon & Phoenix entree. Everything was hot and fresh, the staff was fantastic, and the atmosphere was relaxing.

Big fan of this dish and it's big enough for 2 people. We ordered at peak dinner time so it took about an hour to be delivered. The driver was courteous and the food was hot like it was just made. They do a good job of packaging their food. The chicken had a nice crispy breading and was served in sweet and spicy sauce. I will say all of the sauces seem to be more on the sweet side and it tends to make the chicken soggy after a while. Next time I would get it on the side. Fried rice was tasty and not to salty. They have really good egg rolls as well. We will order from again.",

Food arrived almost 40 minutes after the promised time, over an hour and a half wait in total. Food was cold, drowning in sauce, and only half of the order was correct. Called and requested either the correct order brought back or a refund. I was told I would be refunded for the kung pao shrimp (which was requested not spicy and only contained 6 pieces of shrimp). Never received a refund. Super disappointing experience on several levels. We won't be back.",

The menu is not as all encompassing as other more traditional Chinese restaurants in St. Louis, but good enough for the location. It is a bit cramped, but the atmosphere is good for St. Louis city and it definitely tailors to the more American Chinese food tastes. The portions are decent for the price, but pictures would help with menu ordering. However, service was prompt and nice enough.",

I thought by getting basic dishes they would be a guarantee but they just did not taste authentic, very American. They offer delivery though which is nice considering that's actually not that many places that deliver to my area. But with that being said, they made need to reconsider the delivery service they use. Unfortunately the man delivering was absolutely horrible at directions. After I had explained in the option for special directions on how to get to my door, 7 minutes were very annoyingly spent on trying to explain where I was located though I live on a very known road. He was rude about it and I still had to meet him outside.",

The lady on the phone was very nice and took the order then repeated the order back to my daughter. I heard the order being placed and heard her repeat the order. Picked up the order 30 minutes before they closed, got back to the hotel, parked and went up to our room. Upon getting the food out, found out they completely skipped my daughters food. Called the restaurant 15 minutes before closing time and was hoping they would deliver her food since it was their mistake. Lady refused to deliver it, kept saying she didn't charge me for it. I explained I'd happily pay for it, but my daughter needed food. She refused to make it, deliver it, or anything at all. Just kept arguing that she didn't charge me for it. Will never even consider this place again. Rangoons were like rubber with no flavor and the Chili Oil Beef was like processed beef with no flavor. I expected better, but I'll go back home and get decent Chinese food for a lot less.",
