We were the only customers in the joint except for another group of what appeared to be Vietnamese (please correct me if I am wrong) men hanging out just shooting the sh**. Very low key place to dine with a simple easy to understand menu of various options.  When I picked this place I was under the impression from the pictures posted by previous guests that this place sold alcohol, this is not the case. This restaurant is BYOB. Which is AWESOME because they are literally next to a liquor store...that gives out free samples I might add...just sayin'!  The food we had was pretty good for the most part. They were able to accommodate a wide variety of dietary restrictions. Some of my friends ordered the beef tips, another ordered the crispy chicken, and a few of us ordered the seafood boils. I had crawfish with the original sauce. It was awesome. Southern style seafood boil with an Asian flair. Very unique, but also very good. All of the food was delicious, and the couple running the restaurant were very attentive and friendly. Jokingly asking us to rate our Japanese beer choice compared fo the Vietnamese beer choice...(we chose to keep the beers Asian to go along with the food).  All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant. Again, great place, friendly staff, super chill. I will definitely be back.",

We got the crayfish, shrimp without heads, mussels,  corn, and potatoes with garlic butter and original spice mixes.  The waitress plunked this big steaming bag of seafood on our table.  They also dropped off a bucket, gloves, and a roll of paper towel.  We thought this was so fun.  We had to wait a little bit before eating, everything was SO HOT.  While we ate, we talked about inviting friends to share this fun place. We left feeling very satisfied.  Shortly after dinner, we both had noisy tummies.   We wished each other luck before bed.

You can stop by for a beer and some crawfish or shrimp - The best to close out a busy date with friends. They also serve a variety of vietnamese dishes. The wait can be 5-20' depends on the time. Price is very inexpensive but food quality is average to high. I don't think you can find anything more affordable in this area. The surrounding area is nice to explore. Parking is available around, but getting hard to find around lunch time on weekend. This area is getting better and better for asian and especially vietnamese foods and drinks.",
