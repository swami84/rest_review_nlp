I ordered sandwiches worth $42. The cashier was such a good person. A black lady was preparing our sandwiches she was to nervous and angry. After she finished preparing our sandwiches she thrown our sandwiches in a dirty box and through napkins and told to come grab my food in a very disrespectful way. I asked her if she can put my sandwiches in a bag she started yelling at me. I asked for the manager she said that she is the manager. She kept talking while I was putting my sandwiches in the bags and making fun on me and kept disrespect me in front of my kids. I kept silent and left. This not acceptable at all. I will do my best to shut down this place while they hiring such a horrible employees like her.",

Anyway, I tried them and they soaked my sandwich with Mayo when I didn't ask for any and don't like it, otherwise I would've eaten it cause I was starving. So I called and they said they would deliver a new one. Sure enough the new one was no better, missing ingredients. I get the whole freaky fast slogan but if you're NOT gonna get my order right then maybe you should just take your time. JS I ate the sandwich ONLY because I was starving but after waiting so long to eat, it kinda sucked having to eat something I wasn't really enjoying. ((Thumbs down))",

I had to put extra mayonaise to soften and add flavor to my sandwich. I travel for work and frequently eat at different JJ's across the country, on average 20-30 times a year. I have never rated JJ's in the past as I have never had much to complain about. This location however, has left a sour taste in my mouth. I will not be coming back here again, even though im in Tampa for 10 more days of work. Also, staff was not very intuitive. Definitely not customer oriented. Don't really want to throw them under the bus as they are probably minimum wage employees and need their job. Perhaps the owner can help them to be more professional.",
