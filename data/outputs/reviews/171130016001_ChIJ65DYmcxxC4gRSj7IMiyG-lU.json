If you want a cheap meal, this is not your place.  This is quality food prepared expertly. The experience is only $35. I've seen restaurants offer a similar experience for $50+.  The cocktails are amazing.  They are about $10 each but I feel that is very on par for the quality and compared to other upscale restaurants.  The charcuterie board is generous.  The sexy butter is a must try.  This is a perfect place for a romantic dinner, a special occasion or if you just feel like splurging. I look forward to coming back soon.",

I was literally hit by a wall while waiting to be seated, because no one informed me I may get hit by a swinging wall where I was standing. I was on a date and we were seated at the family table, which is the first thing you see when you walk through the wall-door, not the most romantic location. The dining area to the left when waking in, I think would have been much more intimate. I made late night reservations, because I was confused as to how the earlier \"experience\" even works. I was under the impression it was a family style meal to be shared with other patrons, but have come to find this is not the case. The late night menu is incredibly limited. I ordered \"Parmesan Truffle fries\" and a signature cocktail whose name I cannot recall, both were lackluster and tasteless. My partner's burger tasted like a literal farm, cow patties and all. The best tasting thing of the evening was the slice of heirloom tomato on the burger that no chef can take credit for. The smoke from whatever was happening in the kitchen was so intense that I had makeup all around my eyes by the time I left from tearing. And please do not get me started on the music-- I felt like I was in purgatory with this obnoxious, insanely loud and repetitive piano music over the speakers. I gave two stars for the concept and decor including the ladies room which is selfie perfect. I would have liked to gone back for the \u201cexperience\u201d, but given the smoke, music, and lack of consideration for a couple (who had reservations) I can't say I will be back soon.",

Overall quality of the meal was outstanding, but our experience with the person waiting on us was miserable and makes me never want to come back.  We came for \"the experience\" which is a multi course meal. The food was great. At the time of this review, it is not mentioned anywhere that this is considered a 3 hour endeavor. Had we known that coming in, that would be fine. We unknowingly walked into a 3 hour dinner, which was actually 3 hours and 45 minutes including wait time, despite having reservation made well in advance.  Our waiter was informative about the plates, but was condescending when we were curious about our wait. We were sat, had the appetizer, waited 75 minutes, had the main course, waited 75 minutes, etc...  We were lied to several times about our food. We were routinely told its being plated right now, to just wait more. And more. One party in our group had to leave early, because they weren't expecting the wait. They were then told, very condescendingly, that if they didn't want to wait the 3 hours through \"the experience\" then they shouldn't have gotten \"the experience.\" which again, at the time of this writing, is not stated anywhere on the menu, website, or anywhere that I have looked. When we left, we were told that they mixed up the checks, and the party that left got the wrong check, so we were told we had to make up the difference. We were also blamed for the time it took to serve our food. One person had a nut allergy, and one of the desert plates had pistachios on it. We were told our deserts were plated and ready, then half hour later we were told they were redoing the desert since they put pistachios on it, then a half hour later we got a desert plate that had... Wait for it.... Pistachios on it.  I really wanted to believe that the person waiting on us was horrible and ruined my impression, but I'm not willing to take the gamble on my time and money to try again.",

For the full service, I would not consider it just a place to get a meal, it really is more of an \"experience\". Some people might appreciate that more than others. For those who just want to have a small bite and a few drinks, that seems to be the best thing to do in the bar area.  For the full dinner service, once you get over the fact that this isn't going to be your typical restaurant and understand that you're going to need to keep an open mind going into it, you can really appreciate what they've done here.  Epiphany Farms's restaurants are the most competent, well-rounded restaurants we have in this area, and Bloomington-Normal is better for it.  My wife took me here for my birthday and we chose the NY Strip Steak for the 2nd course, and ...wow, easily cut that thing with a fork and it was cooked perfectly med-rare. The level of attention to detail here far surpasses the previous standard in BloNo. I'm looking forward to to going back",

I knew what to expect going in thanks to my insider connections and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. The design of the restaurant definitely captures that speakeasy vibe and the attention to detail was well executed. Didn\u2019t experience the piano player upon visiting but had good music on the speakers that captured that speakeasy vibe as well. I would reccommend having some sort of speakeasy band play late at night to really capture the spirit of the 20\u2019s.  One thing to keep in mind.... it\u2019s going to be expensive. College students beware! Unless you stick to appetizers. My pork flatbread was incredible and the cocktails were creative and delicious and worth the price. I could tell some time and effort were made to make the drink menu and as someone who makes their own cocktails I was very impressed.  The only negative was that my flatbread took almost 25 min to get to our table but overall had an amazing time and plan to come back again.",

They provide the perfect amount of attention and friendliness in their service and the food is delicious! I enjoyed eating foods and drinks in unexpected combinations and preparations. They also tell you about everything they are serving from what it is to how it's prepared and from where it came. The food is prepared for groups of two to share. Be prepared to pay at least $100 or more for two people if you get drinks and any add-ons. I recommend The Bee's Knees and the pickle bowl for a drink and extra. The whole experience is definitely worth every penny!",

Now, with that said, it's worth every penny. The food is absolutely phenomenal. It's as good as ANY high end restaurant I've been in anywhere (including Chicago, New Orleans, California, I'm an amateur foody I guess). The menu is adventurous and it pays off. Even dishes I wouldn't think I'd like are excellent. For instance, radishes, I abhor radishes...they not only made them palatable, but very very good.  I can't rate the food highly enough.  The other thing is the cocktails. Again, these aren't your standard bar fare drinks. They are clearly crafted with love, and it shows. Try something on the edge of your comfort zone and you will be pleasantly rewarded.  The real draw though is the atmosphere. They're going for a 1920's prohibition style speak easy. They nailed it. Everything from the hidden door entrance, to the piano player, to the drinks, to the overall look. It's all very well executed and something completely refreshing for this area.  The final word...try this place. I can't recommend it enough.",
