I called Rumi and the manager, Moe was extremely accommodating and apologetic on behalf of Door Dash even though it was zero fault of Moe's or Rumi\"s. He sent Rumi's delivery driver to deliver fresh & warm food (they must have remade the food since Door Dash completely failed to do their job and the previous order was probably cold). The food was great! I highly recommend Rumi, but save yourself time & energy and order directly through Rumi as their customer service is beyond great! P.S. get the Baklava!",

My wife and I thought it was better than nearby Sultan's. Their spicy sauce is just hot enough with a little sweetness to take the edge off. Almost couldn't decide whether I wanted more sauce or to just appreciate the falafel sandwich and the interplay of the toppings: purple cabbage, seasoned raw onions, hummus, tahini, cucumber salad etc. The feta fries left something to be desired but the fries themselves were good and crispy. We didn't get drinks bc there wasn't an option that isn't overly sweet. Hey Rumi owners, add a lightly sweetened drink to the menu for those of us who like a beverage but don't want the sweet stuff!",

The staff is very friendly, and helpful, I decided on the \"All-in Platter\" Plate to get a feel of the diversity of items on their menu. This seems to consist of Gyro Meat, Chicken Swarma, what I believe may have been Lamb Kabob, Falafel, Basmati Rice, half of a pita and some sort of Mint Salad. (please note order yourself an extra full pita if you like to eat pita with this type of food the price for one is pretty cheap :P)  I found the meats of the plate tasty, and left a pleasent long lasting spicy flavor on my palate that I have not experience quite a while. That I would consider mildly spicy. The only thing that I didn't really care for was the mint, just not a big fan of mint in general, so I can't really attest to how good the salad was. The pitas are excellent, get yourself an extra one.  The menu is 100% Zabinhah Halal according to their website. I would say definately go if you want  a different take on this region's type of food.",

I called and asked to order a tabouli salad with chicken shawarma on top Since I do not eat bread or rice for my diet. The girl that answered the phone said they cannot do that. I then asked her how much is the chicken kabob skewer a la carte, she said $3.50 (I was thinking to jus order that with tabbouleh. But I told her I will look at the menu online and call back. I did call back about ten minutes later, before I took my lunch break and the same girl answered, I told her I would like to order one small side of hummus, one side of tabbouleh, a small order of falafel and one chicken kabob skewer. She said she can\u2019t sell the chicken skewer alone, it has to be in a pita or a plate or on salad. I told her that I don\u2019t eat bread or rice and I wanted to order it that way. She said OK I will do it for you this time And the skewer is $4.00. I told her I\u2019m not interested in ordering and I\u2019m going to be honest that was the worst first impression to try a place that is new to me. I I\u2019m not telling the owner or manager what to do but I will say that it is unusual especially for Mediterranean or Middle Eastern restaurant to not offer to sell chicken kebab or beef kebab skewers a la carte. Some people don\u2019t eat rice some people don\u2019t eat bread and maybe some people don\u2019t want to order it on a salad. The girl on the phone clearly has minimal experience in dealing with customers. Unfortunately I will not be trying this place.",

The falafel was my absolute favorite, it was so perfectly seasoned and crunchy!! The gyro was perfect, this one was lacking tomato (idk if that\u2019s traditional) but it made it so much easier to eat. It was also filled in a pita instead of on top so it was easier to eat and less messy than most of my experiences! The pita for the hummus was a lot more bread-y than I was expecting, very fluffy. The hummus was eh. Way too light and mousse-y for my personal taste and it came in prepackaged plastic. Last but not least, the baklava was pretty good, not the greatest but still good!  Overall, would like to come back to this place one day for their perfect falafels and maybe not order the hummus.",
