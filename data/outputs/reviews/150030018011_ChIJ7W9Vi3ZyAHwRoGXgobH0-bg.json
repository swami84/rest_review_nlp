We were given the check after the first plate. While going to get our second plate, we were asked if we were leaving.  The food is about the worst you can get. There\u2019s a rude chef making omelets. Cheese wasn\u2019t melted.  Smoked salmon was hard and tastes cheap.  They have the stand bread, bacon, eggs, fruits, juice. But they were all horrible. Juice was not fresh and you can taste the preservatives. Bread was typical and not worthy of $40 buffet. Fruits was worse than standard grocery store.  This buffet should be free or $10 max.  Hyatt regency Waikiki has got to be one of the worst hotels I\u2019ve ever stayed at.",
