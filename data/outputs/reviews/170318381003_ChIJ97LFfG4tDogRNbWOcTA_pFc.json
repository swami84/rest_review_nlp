You can taste the seasoning in the meat along with a sweet taste which I believe is mango or pineapple.  This is the prefect location for me. It took about 5 mins to walk there and 5 mins back to work.  It's street parking but it's metered parking be prepared to pay about $2.00 per hour.  This place is definitely worth coming back to.

The only two negatives would be that the salsa given were spicy and I was sweating quite a bit after. Second, the chips were bit on the oily side for my taste.

Then she asked the cooks about it, they said they have a few fries left and agreed to make it for me. At first they were going to give me the fries on the side,  but I asked for my money back and they agreed to make a new one. I opened my food before I left, everything looked good.

It was a poor choice because everything was ridiculously delicious and rather than making the good decision of leaving half the burrito for later, I ate everything they gave me and got a tummyache.  The carne asada was fantastic; I've never had it so juicy and tender.  There was also red onion slaw in the burrito, I think made with just red onion and red cabbage, that was shockingly good (I'm usually not big on raw red onion or raw cabbage).  They're very busy, so consider takeout or delivery, but definitely put this food in your face.",

I called in my to-go order for a carne asada burrito and was told \"give me 5 minutes.\" Wow, that is quick. Got there, paid, and was asked if I wanted any to-go sauces. Heck yes. Both please. The burrito itself was flavorful AF! The carne asada was tender and juicy, with a hint of smokiness. Loved it. My only gripe was that there wasn't any avocado :( Here I was surprised that the description had avocado without having to pay extra but nope, none was to be found in my burrito.. Maybe cause it's out of season? But \"this is America and I want it now\" Well, no worries, cause it was still delicious.  Excited for my lazy days of not packing a lunch so I can come back here!  Things to note: -They accept Samsung Pay!! (gotta get my points if you have a Samsung phone and don't have SP, get on it!! Message me for a referral code :D) -Taco Tuesdays! $2 tacos on Tuesday! Only a .50 cent savings but that's a whole $1 if you buy 2! -They have lengua tacos but no lengua burritos.. interesting..",
