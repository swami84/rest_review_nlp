The Tonkotsu ramen broth was delicious and had great depth of flavor. The noodles were slightly overcooked. The lobster and chive dumplings were pretty, but the skins were too thick and the filling flavors didn't really stand out. My friend is vegetarian and appreciated the option of vegetarian ramen. I suppose prices were what you could expect from downtown Chicago, so I wasn't too surprised by the bill. Service was friendly and the wait wasn't too long for food.",

I can see the appeal to a hungry college kid but I bought something else when I was hungry and in college. The flavor is there but I wasn't impressed as much as I had hoped. It was an \"Eh!\" experience for me. Again I blame my own ignorance. Would I go again? Sure but I would want to try something more substantial if they had it otherwise I think I would pass. \u200d",

The only critic would be adding some sort of sauce so it\u2019s not as dry. The fried pork belly mantou bun did have a sauce. The bun was soft and pillowy. The fried pork skin was super crispy. The pork was well prepared so it just melted in my mouth. I could\u2019ve used just a bit more crisp for both meats on my buns. The bun and meat combo can be a lot of softness without a crispy element, and my cucumbers weren\u2019t as crispy as I was expecting so the only crisp I got on the pork bun was the few moments biting into the pork skin. Same for the fried chicken bun, but the crisp is something not everyone needs a lot of. So i guess it\u2019s better to do it this way and next time I can just ask for crispier. I also got the sumo bowl and added fried garlic and buttered corn. I like more corn so I added some. The fried garlic on top was such a good addition. The flavor was magnificent added with that broth and chashu!! I did NOT care for the xo wontons. When I bit into it, the taste was like old, spoiled seafood, and that\u2019s the taste I got. It tasted like nasty shrimp. I didn\u2019t care for it. I took that one bite, and threw the rest out. This was my first time eating a ramen bowl but I\u2019ve always wanted to try them. This place did not disappoint. I would definitely eat from here again. Overall, with a few adjustments to my order, I would do an order from here again. It was delicious. I\u2019m satisfied.  Edit: Response to owner. No, I got no additional sauces. The food was still tasty though. Thank you for taking the time out to respond!!",

We got the spicy miso ramen, the green curry shrimp ramen and the tonkotso ramen. I asked them to make my green curry ramen extra spicy with sesame oil additional chili flakes and fried garlic. All 3 of us loved our choices. The noodles were well made and the broth was quite tasty. We'd also ordered an edamame, which I'm not a big fan of, but enjoyed all the same. Decent price for the location, good food and nice atmosphere. Recommend it to anyone who's looking ramen in the area.",

Can't say about any alcohol, I only had a coke, which is canned. I think the price was fair for what I had and the food was very fresh and tasty! I used the chopsticks, I wasn't bold enough to ask for other utensils.  Try it you'll like it!  The staff make you feel welcome and explain everything which helped a lot!",

The tonkotsu ramen was so unbearably salty that it made my skin itch! The maki sushi was great - but the side salad was terribly small and flavorless, the miso soup (like the ramen) was too salty, and the edamame only came with 10 pieces. This place could be so much better if they balanced the salt with other flavors! Also too much garlic in the ramen (way too much compared to other great ramen restaurants in the city). For the price ($42 with tip) it was not worth it.",

One of the best deals you can get in the area.  The old school hip hop music that was playing that day was amazing!  From their menu:  All ramen are served with Tokyo wavy noodles from Sun Noodle.  I opted for the miso salmon and the tonkotsu (pork broth, chashu pork, and molten egg).  We also added lobster dumplings (4 pieces for $6) and an order of xoxo shrimp & pork with dried scallop, and berkshire ham for $9.  Everything was delicious, the only thing I would skip next time would be the lobster dumplings, (just not worth the price imho).   Service is very fast, if you need to watch your time, you will be in and out with time to spare.  Right now if you sign up for their email newsletter, you can get $10.00 off your next visit.  All in all, if you are craving ramen around lunch time, their express lunch cannot be beat.",

I'm from California (we have a lot of ramen places) and have been to multiple regions of Japan multiple times. I've only tried their tonkotsu and spicy miso broths, but they were both very good. They got a really nice depth of flavor on the tonkotsu. I ordered firm noodles and they didn't disappoint. The proportion of both noodles and pork given were great. Some places will skimp on either. We also had the karaage which was tasty and crispy and the sauce it came with was great as well. We got the brussel sprouts, which are deep fried, and they were delicious as well. Finally, service was excellent. Bonus points for providing a lobster chair for my infant. Double bonus for having a working NBA Jam arcade machine that is on free play!",

Also with the lunch combo you can get a wonderful piece of broiled salmon on a bed of rice to go with the ramen. I will say the regular menu seems a bit pricy. But it is a really nice place. They have a very good selection of Japanese alcohol as well. The draft beer is imported from Japan, which is huge. Japanese beer brewed in the states tastes not so good. The hot sake is great too.

The atmosphere was very pleasant too (provided you like classic hip-hop,) with a large space with a more industrial ambiance to it, and the music selection is on point if you like classic hip-hop. They have a very well stocked bar, focusing on whiskeys, particularly Japanese whiskeys.  The only negative was that I found the ramen to be much less composed than many of the other options in the city, and it really looked like someone quickly put the different ingredients in the bowl, and poured in some broth. It didn't impact the flavor, which was very good, but if other restaurants can assemble their ramen with a higher level of care, why can't Ramen-San?  I don't think this is the best ramen in Chicago, and it won't become a go-to destination for me, but I also wouldn't tell anyone not to go there.",

They have their own twist on an Arnold Palmer, their house lemonade and green tea, which was quite a treat! For desert they serve ice cream or Oreo cream puffs. I had the puffs and was resisting ordering a second round. Like, if you enjoy cream puffs, you have to try these! No pic, cause I ate them too fast lol Also, if you work for Northwestern (University or hospital) they are offering a free steamed bun with purchase of a ramen bowl! Just have to show your ID badge!",
