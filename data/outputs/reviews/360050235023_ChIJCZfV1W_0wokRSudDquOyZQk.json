Shrimp, King Crab legs, Dungeness crab. The Seafood was old, sour and spoiled. It had a horrible rotten smell. The boiled egg, potatoes and corn had a slim coating and horrible smell. I called the company and the owner yelled at me and hung up the phone. I spent 106.00. A waste of my money",

Cons: -The quality of their food does not justify the price increases they\u2019ve made over the last year, in my opinion. -Fast delivery is great but they do not take time to properly clean their shrimp of feces before cooking it alongside other food. -Inspect your chicken next time you buy General Tso\u2019s because it\u2019s tends to be mostly breading and sauce with a little bit of meat in the center.

The delivery service was horrible he wouldn\u2019t come upstairs or in my building when they specifically asked the apartment number and at the time couldn\u2019t make it downstairs which I ended up having to do to get my food anyways. Delivery guy was very rude, he kept calling and hanging up on me on the phone when I was asking him politely to come up. The food was very displeasing. The rice was okay not very much flavor, but the general tsos was horrible it was barely cooked really mushy and soggy in a way which was weird because they were very stingy on the sauce!! The sauce wasn\u2019t great! The best thing was the homemade tea, because even the egg roll was like stretch dough on the inside when I tried to eat it but crispy on the outside. When I are the meat I  didn\u2019t know if I was tasting chicken or some other kind of animal. I called them and told them immediately after getting my food that I will mention,  I did not eat and was told they would replace it and cook everything correctly. Ten minutes later they call and let me know I basically waisted my money and they wouldn\u2019t come back to replace it or give me my refund a WASTE of about 12 dollars I\u2019m still furious! Because the customer service and food was horrible!!!! They then told me if I wanted a refund I would have to bring the food back and show them instead of sending delivery guy back. I REPEAT DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!",

I have 4 full orders that include rice and 2 egg rolls so how would that be enough?! Then lied and said there was 6 when there wasn't and I've had multiple occasions where they have lied verses acknowledging a mistake (they do happen!). The only good thing was the fried wontons. In the past I've had issues with missing food and then lying to me and tell me what they think I ordered. I best thing about this place is the delivery time. Nonetheless there's too many hits and misses to keep spending food and it's not good. Hopefully someone would eat this food I paid for. Next time I'll cook or order pizza.",

        "caption": "Although delivery was fast, the wonton soup barely had filling and the dough was undercooked. The fantail shrimp had one tiny shrimp encased in a mountain of greasy fried dough. Even the egg rolls barely had filling. I was very displeased with the level of dough in my food. Other than that, it does taste good, but if you want to eat more than just dough, I suggest other places. I barely ate what I ordered. I ended up throwing most of it away.",
