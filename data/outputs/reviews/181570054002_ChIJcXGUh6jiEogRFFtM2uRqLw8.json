I always tend to over-order on my first order at a new place (in case of small portions), and so I ordered a Western burger, loaded classic fries, and onion rings.  The burger was 100% fine, not the best I've had, but perfectly acceptable. The quality of the ingredients was good, just a tad bit on the dry side for my taste (seemed like a lean burger). I think next time I'll try a different burger rather than the Western, but it's probably just personal preference.  The onion rings were some of the best beer battered onion rings I've ever had, the batter was superb, and they weren't way too sweet like some battered onion rings I've had. They also held up remarkably well for delivery.  However, the main reason I'm giving this 5 stars is the loaded classic fries.  Loaded fries are one of my favorite foods on this planet (especially with chili), and AJ's made the best I've ever had. There was plenty of chili and cheese without making the fries soggy, and I never had a dry fry. The quality of the chili was great, and the perfect consistency. The jalapenos on top gave a great amount of spice, but may be a bit much for some people. Overall super balanced, and a perfect portion size for the cost. From now on I'll definitely just grab a burger and a loaded fry.",

Not sure if i read it right when ordered but there was nothing Buffalo( hot sauce ) about this burger. Think they put some type of bbq sauce on it with Bleu Cheese. Definitely not what i was expecting kinda feel like it was false advertising. Might need to change that burgers name....and don't say its a Chicago thing because i lived there for 20yrs.

My chili cheese dog was covered in in all the sauces and wrapped up very tight making the bun extremely soggy. It tasted alright but I could hardly tell what I was eating it was such a mess. Also when you order online you're forced to get some type of fries/side with it. You can no longer just get the main meal. You shouldn't have to pay for the extra food that you don't want. This is the first time I've been this disappointed in their food and I don't think I'll be ordering it again any time soon.",

        "caption": "First, I'm from Chicago,  so if you're looking for a Chicago Style Italian Beef, while this restaurant does \"technically\" serve just that, it is the equivalent of Taco Bell being Mexican. The beef seems to be pre-sliced/refrigerated for what tastes to be a good amount of time. I say this because you can taste their refrigerator on the beef. Also, the beef is both very dry and sometimes cold. This is because they don't keep the beef on the warmer to cook properly like a traditional Chicago Style joint. Keep in mind this happened on several occasions while dining in and out. I only say this due to the employees having explained the wrapping and transport of takeout \"makes the beef dry?\". Next, the sweet peppers have on more than one occasion tasted as if they're past their prime. Further, their AJ's loaded fries are topped with the following: canned jalapenos,  canned nacho cheese,  canned chili and some type of nasty ranch dressing.  If you are eating in, expect a foul smell at their location. Keep in mind, some of their soft drinks are stale as well. Finally,  the icing on the cake...Last time I was in there, one of the employees picked his nose just before packing my order. Sure it was just off to the left, but I am an alert person who pays attention to details. Throw that in with their employees acting as if none of them want to be there and pretty much look through you when you try to talk with them, you will be sure to have a wonderful experience.  The only reason I've given them 2 stars is because it's the only Chicago Style restaurant around here. You're better off driving 70 miles to Merrillville in order to get Portillo's Italian Beef.",

The driver was new to the area and wasnt sure where to go so I had to text him my address and help talk him through how to get here. I still have the text messages from the driver and the call history in my phone. We still tipped the driver well because he felt so bad that he was so late and was told the wrong address. By the time my food got here it was cold and my husband and I both got sick from it. Before I finally got my food, I was able to talk to a male manager who said he would put a $20 credit for me to use the next time I went in because I spent $40 for my food to be delivered cold. I'm pregnant and cant eat cold meat for risk of listeria and other harmful bacteria that can harm myself and my baby,  so I had to wait to heat up my food before I could eat it safely and even after that I still got sick from it because it sat in a car for 2 1/2 hours. When I called tonight to order and use my credit, a girl manager stated there was no credit on file and did nothing to help resolve the issue. So instead of getting food that my husband and I had planned out, we decided to not order because we were expecting to use the $20 credit. It's really sad how the management there is being run and I really dont think I will recommend AJs on any side of town to anyone or go again.",

After lots of persuasion, my boyfriend agreed to buy from them via HungryBoiler. Wrong order once again!! The order was printed 100% correct on the invoice and receipt.  The food was just not what it said on the receipt.  Called in to AJ's asking for a replacement. We don't want a refund, we want the food that we ordered and we want it very soon (we already waited for an hour for the wrong order). Guess what? Manager said he could get the food to us asap but he would want the wrong burger back. Wow!! We were just appalled at the whole experience and the request of the manager.  Quality is average. If you would go over to triple xxx (about 50 ft away), they offer better service, better quality food, quick service and they never got our orders wrong.  Stay away from this restaurant. If I could give them 0.5 stars, I would.",

For $10, I received a burger that was thin, dry, and had no flavor.  There was no condiments nor dressings such as lettuce, tomato, pickle onion etc. on it although I didn't specifically request, I just assumed it would be dressed with something.

I would have to say the main reason I have ordered multiple times over the last five years is the times they actually make a good bacon burger. I have had an instance where in my loaded waffle fry was a gnat.... could have been a fly but looked more like a gnat. I called about it and the manager did not really seem like he cared asked if I wanted another one I said no because it kinda grossed me out and it was late. The insect was smashed on the side of one of the waffle fries. A lot of the times the burgers come soggy when delivered this has happen on numerous occasions. The soggy burger issue seems to be getting better has not happen in awhile. What has finally made me write this review is the fact that I tried to place an order for delivery before 2:45 am, which is the time on hungry boiler that says they stop delivering and they told me they are not delivering. I asked what if I had placed an order thru hungry boiler and they said that they will cancel it. It does not matter if it is a minute before the time you stop delivering if you get an order you should make and deliver it. Overall this place is pretty over priced but if you get lucky you might get a decent burger delivered.",

A step above a very bad drive-in.  They say that their burgers are never frozen...unfortunately I had the breaded loin and a fountain drink. $8 and change. Not worth it at all. My coworker had a sandwich mozzarella sticks and a drink $15 and change. She was very disappointed in price and quality. She will never eat there again.  This was the Lafayette location by Wal-Mart.

I also asked for cheese which i paid extra for. Took a bite and i could barley get it down it was awful tasting. So i go and get a cup of nacho cheese thinking it will mask the taste i had to pay 1.06 for a CUP OF CHEESE which i was upset abt because the sign said 60\u00a2. Never will i eat here again they have better Italian beef in gas stations in chicago then they do at aj. I only rated them to write this review otherwise No \ud83d\ude45 Stars!!!

Their fries are just right and their burgers are great too. Once had a question about ingredients and the manager ripped the box apart from the back and let me read the ingredients panel for myself. Location is nice and convenient from Purdue's campus, I eat there about 1 a week on average.  Only downside is ventilation is a bit lacking, so it can get smokey during busier times, but they are aware of the problem and try to clear out the air if it ever becomes a problem.  AJ's is the Portillos of Indiana. If these guys ever leave, I will shed many tears.",
