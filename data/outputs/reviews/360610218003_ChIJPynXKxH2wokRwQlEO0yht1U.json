        "caption": "I placed my order for a take out delivery now when I started telling the boy on the phone my order he kept telling me to hold on, I said why and then he proceeded to put me on hold for 7 minutes, so I hung up and called back. He answers again, and I now am frustrated with this disrespect so I say my order and give him my  card information. When I  proceeded to give him my address he told me to hold on AGAIN, so I ask why, \"he says it's because of the rice, I knew to check on the rice, so I say okay and proceed to wait.\" So tell me how when the food arrives the price is higher up than I expected it be. That's because he placed a extra large white rice on my order, so I asked for the manager and he handed over the phone to a girl who was not the restaurant manager and without saying a word she proceeds to tell me that the boy recorded the conversation from earlier and she is going to let me listen to it, without hesitation. (Okay so if this doesn't sound like the most unprofessional situation, then I don't know what does). She comes back to the phone after 4 minutes of having me on hold on plays the recording to me through the phone. I was completely over the conversation at this point because of this disrespect and hung up on her. The food as you may know, this isn't an authentic chinese food restaurant and normally when entering a restaurant, a server will acknowledge your party and seat all three or two or four of you at an accommodating table. Here you'll be yelled at across the room \"What do you want!\" So don't expect to get any respect from those people unless you're white (They give their white customers the utmost because... well frankly I don't know why). I say this because the staff at this restaurant are known for disrespecting each and every colored person that walks through their doors, as if we're some \"bottom feeder\". Now I don't live in the projects; but, even if I did that doesn't mean that I am not A PAYING CUSTOMER who deserves to be treated with respect. If businesses in Harlem cannot treat customers in Harlem with respect then those businesses should not be allowed to do business in Harlem. Frankly, I am sick and damn tired of people feeling like they can treat the darker residents of this community with such blatant disrespect and dismiss them just because they feel like they can get away with it. I paid for my food because I was determined there was more than one way to address this type of situation. I didn't tip the delivery man, who was mumbling obscenities at me the whole time. When I gave him the money, he told me to s&*k his ____ and f&*k you, b&*^h. Needless to say, I will not be ordering from these racists anymore. If Empire 3 Chinese restaurant were to be graded on their customer service skills they would get a Negative 0. They are LITERALLY the most unprofessional, rude people on the planet, Like how do you think it's okay to disrespect someone that's giving you THEIR MONEY! I order from here because their close in distance to my home, but I after this experience with the restaurant, I WILL NEVER EAT FROM HERE AGAIN! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE. P.S. They like to lie about who's the manager at the restaurant by handing the phone over to each making you think they are the manager by changing their voices.",
