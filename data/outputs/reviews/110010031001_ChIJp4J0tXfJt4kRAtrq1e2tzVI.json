The servings are delightfully lavish and shareable (their \u201csmall\u201d salad is a lovely huge mound of beautiful greens!) and the pizza is hearty and satisfying. Also, a brilliant layout, combined with the neighboring cafe Colony Club, a slick bar section with a very cool entryway, and an awesome outdoor patio area. Excited to hit this place up in the summer, too! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",

        "caption": "Looks like your old school neighborhood pizza place, but (happily) doesn't taste like it and (sadly) ain't priced like it.  We stopped in here after hearing it finally opened a few days ago and ordered a large pizza to share at home. I'm pretty sure it was the Pizza Don - tomatoes, mozzarella, salami, oregano, and arugula.  Pizza was delicious and really unique. I don't think there is a lot of good sicilian-style pizza in the area so this is a treat. The crust is fairly thick with a perfectly crunchy bottom, the cheese and oregano were generous, the salami was wonderful, and it was all brought together by a super tasty drizzle of really nice fresh olive oil. The whole flavor profile and structure of the pizza is quite different from most of the other higher-end pizza places in DC, which tend to be Neapolitan style. This really tastes like a very familiar and comforting flavor profile, elevated by really thoughtful high-quality ingredients.  They only serve pizza in two sizes: either by the slice or by the whole pie. We got a whole pie, which says it feeds 3-4, and that seems right. The two of us each ate two slices (the pie has 8) and felt pretty full. Eating 3 slices would probably have left me feeling way overstuffed. We'll both have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  My only complaint is the price here - while the aesthetic and decor feel like a welcoming pizza joint out of the 70s, our large pie was $32 or $34, which strikes me as borderline unheard of. That said, the pizza is very good and that $30+ comfortably turns into (for us) 4 servings of the stuff, so maybe it's justifiable - judge for yourself. We didn't try any of the individual slices, but they had simpler toppings and less eye-popping prices - about $4 a slice, depending on your selection. Maybe the solution for these guys is to offer a 4-slice pie priced at closer to $15 to avoid customers' sticker shock?  It was already pretty busy on a Sunday evening - there wasn't a wait for a table but it was crowded and buzzing. Presumably once word gets out it will be even more of a zoo - go soon!  Also note - they aren't taking take out orders by phone yet, so for now you'll have to drop by in person if you want to get pizza to go.",
