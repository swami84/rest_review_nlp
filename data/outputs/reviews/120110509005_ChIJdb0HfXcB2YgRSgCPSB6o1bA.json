So I gave this place a shot, Welllll let me tell u something, What a pleasant surprise. Their soups were incredible! The hot and sour was thick and full of flavor, the wonton soup \ud83c\udf5c was like a party in my mouth. The broth was fresh and wontons flavorful.

I called to let them know the egg roll was soggy my reply was yes that happens when it travels.

She suggested that the next time I order I get something else.  I didn\u2019t even get into the greasy fried rice and the house special fried rice was so salty I couldn\u2019t eat more than two forks of it.  I used to enjoy chatting with her while I waited for my food to be prepared but now you can\u2019t even get in the door.

They go beyond the norm and they provide excellent customer service.  They let me know what they are able to do and are specific about certain ingredients such as pork in the egg-roll.   The only issue I can state is that the food is not up to a \"Chinese\" standard to a degree.  For example, I asked for shrimp fried rice and it was clear to me it lacked the Chinese charm like green onions, bean sprouts and enough shrimp to impress me.  However, it was still tasty and included eggs which was great.  But it felt less like a Chinese rice and more like a home-made version without all the usual ingredients.  Additionally, I ordered the Tso's chicken which I was really happy about and the chicken was great, but the sauce did have a slight taste of over-cooking (burn).  I will admit that it was still great but just not at the top of what it could have been given if they would have taken a little more time to make it perfect, I'm a patient person so the wait time would not have bothered me.  Also, I would have preferred the breaded chicken be a bit more \"toasty/crunchy\" which is what usually I like about the dish.  Overall, this place is good, has great staff, the lady at the front desk is exceptional and can't say anything but great things, they take interest, are communicative, and friendly so it makes you want to visit again.  The Food is still good, tasty, filling, but it could be better if not beautiful if they took more interest in making it perfect.  It seems that most restaurant experiences are either a 1 or a 5 and some rare occasions a 2 to 4;  I can definitely say I leave a 3 star rating which I'm willing to change on the up-side.  I'll definitely eat here again, I think they can do better.",

When I arrived I saw the cash only signs and was concerned I wouldn't be able to pay for my food. The woman who is always running the phones and register said not to worry and that she would make sure I ate dinner that night. She allowed me to pay what I could with the cash I had (about 1/2 of the bill) as long as I returned next week to pay the remaining balance.  With that kind of care and customer service I will return to this local Chinese take out spot for as long as I live in the area. Thanks South Sea!",
