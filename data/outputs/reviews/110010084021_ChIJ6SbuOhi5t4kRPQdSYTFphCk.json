It opened on the corner of H Street and 13th Northeast in one of the new buildings popping up in the historic district. They make certified Neapolitan pizza. Originally based in San Francisco, this is their second shop in the country. A few things to love about it:  1) Ethos: It's a deaf-owned business employing people who are deaf in the city.  2) Pizza: It's really good. I ordered the salumi pizza and it was tasty and had the right amount of kick to it.  The only thing I will say is it's pricey. My pizza filled just me up and it was $20.",

Overall some really tasty pies, but the true hero of the culinary experience was the garlic dipping sauce. Do make sure to pick up a couple sides with your next order, that stuff is magical.  Totally adding Mozzeria to our take-out rotation. :)",

One amazing thing about the restaurant is that everyone signs, but it\u2019s difficult to communicate with them if you cannot sign. I would suggest a white board to help with this. Also, because of the communication divide we were not told how long our pizza would take after ordering. It took almost one hour to get one pizza. Also, they had ran out of Gf crust so only my fianc\u00e9 could eat. After finally getting our pizza and bringing it home it was cold.  We definitely want to go back to give them another chance as we were so excited for Mozzeria in our neighborhood. We\u2019ll try again in a few weeks and hope they have gluten free crust and we don\u2019t have to wait as long. Strongly recommend ordering online for now.",
