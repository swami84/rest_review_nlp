Every few mins they asked if I needed anything else , which I totally appreciated . The prices, yasssss the prices \ud83d\ude29 relatively cheat $25 for dinner lunch might have been $15 don\u2019t quote me . They have a decent selection of cheap alcohol ( I\u2019m definitely here for this). One thing that could have been better is their sides and its portions I do feel like it\u2019s certainly lacking but that\u2019s because I\u2019m use to the going to different Korean barbecues . In conclusion, I do recommend this place and I definitely can\u2019t wait to try it out with my friends. Xoxox Gossip girl LOL",

Iron Age is definitely a good value for the money, but for the best quality KBBQ in DC, I would recommend Gogi Yogi.",
