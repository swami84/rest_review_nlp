        "caption": "Awesome place.  Emphasize huge sandwiches.  I eat big and probably could do well with a half (now, that\u2019s embarrassing). Great bread and meats.  Maybe a tad too heavy on the dijonnaise on the il Pappa (pictured) but who would want to  quibble with greatness.  The meatball sub daily special was awesome too. Great meatballs, sauce, cheese. Curious use of pesto maybe made it too complex for me (I\u2019m old school) but still a wonderful tasty gooey mess.  Also, a shout out for the authentic, complex, delicious ribollita and the gardiniera pickled vegetables.   A new star in the neighborhood.  Order in now.",

        "caption": "I was intrigued by the beautiful sandwich photography on Caviar and decided that if the food tastes half as good as it looks then I would be in for a great dinner. Oh boy am I glad I did. Got the Il Papa and the Spicy Salami and whoa boy. What an odyssey of taste. Each sandwich had a delightful balance of tastes and textures. The bread was soft yet still crusty and substantial. The perfect amount of condiments were used on each and let me tell you- these sandwiches are HUGE - which is good because you won\u2019t want to ever stop eating them. Think Homer Simpson drooling at his desk good. If you\u2019re reading this just get the sandwich already.",
