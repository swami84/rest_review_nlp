They dealt calmly and efficiently with all of our many demands. Keeping cool under pressure. All of the dishes came out promptly and were evenly spaced which is no small feat! When our sushi arrived they had evenly split all of it into 4 plates so we didn't have to pass it around. We were so happy with the food and service. I highly recommend for large parties because they really know what they're doing. A+++",

They were on time for their delivery and their rolls and Maki\u2019s were okay. Nothing spectacular, but I didn\u2019t expect great, Good was fine for rolls. Anyone can make these, including myself, however there are  \u201cTells\u2019 \u201d to see if a Japanese Rest is authentic, order any hot entree items.  I ordered a Katsu Don. It was awful. The Katsu was dry and hard. They were idiotic enough to ad ingredients that would NEVER be In Katsu Don. Miso soup was Kikoman Instant Packaged powder. The salad dressing was bottled. The Teriyaki sauce they used on the Eel was sickeningly sweet. Another sign god is not prepared by Japanese. It was horrible This is a rest owned by Thai nationals. Nothing wrong with that as long as they can prepare Japanese food properly, which they cannot. I read reviews on this . These people who wrote such positive reviews on this joint have NO idea what constitutes good Japanese food . They\u2019re experiences are most likely based on food from a food court if they think this place is good. Like I said , anyone can make rolls, but unless trained by Japanese or being Japanese themselves they would not know how to make authentic foods. This place was awful",

I'd be so inclined to say that if there was a fast to medium food Michelin rating this restaurant would have 3* easy.  I first tried this restaurant during the week while sitting in my office and searching for where to order from. #FirstWorldProblems of course. Anyhow, this restaurant came up with a full 5 stars and well, how can you not jump at that? Amiright? I was in the mood for Japanese cuisine but not sushi so it's kind of tough to find that perfect place that has a mix of both. This place has it all, from amazing appetizers to noodles and chicken. So my friend and I ordered takeout through seamless which arrived on time, hot and fresh.  We ordered, Veggie Yaki Udon, Salmon Asparagus, Kani Salad, Edamame, Vegetable Dumplings, Sesame Tuna Tataki. All of which were so amazing I couldn't stop raving about it. Firstly, it was my first time trying something on the menu that you don't find at regular sushi restaurants, i.e. the salmon asparagus. It is a very perfectly cooked asparagus wrapped with salmon. Tasty is an understatement. The sauces went so well, I just wanted more and more.  That night, I told my husband we must go to the restaurant and try it. Knowing how much he loves sushi and is a die hard BONDST fan, I figured this place could almost live up to those expectations. So Friday night, we decided to have dinner there. They're only open a month so when we walked in they were empty but were doing lots of take out orders. I think with a little more marketing you'll eventually need to reserve in advance (yeah, it's that good).  (Note it's a BYOB spot for now) We did bring our own bottle of wine which they graciously opened without charging a corking fee. And immediately sat us down with water, salad, and menus. This time we ordered the Edamame, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Salmon Asparagus, Black Cod, Musashi Roll & Spicy Lover Roll.  The sushi rolls were absolutely incredibly fresh and tasty with the perfect amount of sauce to match the flavours. Simply heavenly. The black cod was pure butter. It just melted on my tongue. The only other place I've had such great cod was at Morimoto, so you can understand how amazing the quality of food is here. The Yellowtail Jalapeno had the perfect amount of spice and crunch going. What can I say, you really should try this place before they become world class.  For dessert they actually gave us mochi ice cream, (my first time trying it -- I adore it) green tea and vanilla. Pretty much the perfect end to a phenomenal meal. To top it off all of this was so reasonably priced it just makes me want to be a regular customer here.  The decor is super romantic and calm, as if beckoning you in and making you want to stay forever. Go, this restaurant does not disappoint.",

This is also probably one of the best sashimi deals in the neighborhood and the fish was extremely fresh. The decor is clean and minimalist, very true to Japanese culture. Musashi is not as fancy as some of the other sushi establishments in Manhattan, but if you are looking for a more casual no frills sushi experience, this is your place. Musashi is definitely our new go to.",
