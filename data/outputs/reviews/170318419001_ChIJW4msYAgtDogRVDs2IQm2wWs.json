If you are in the downtown area, highly recommend you try a family meal from the Outpost. Delivery is of course available, but pick up was very easy and quick.  The meal is heat and eat, so we enjoyed margaritas while good smells were coming from the oven. The chicken/steak tacos were very fresh, with creative flavors. The guacamole was outstanding, as were the sauces.  After dinner, we watched the Netflix mockumentary \"Death to 2020.\" Highly recommend.  A great meal, and a good laugh = a balm for the soul",

They make their own chorizo, which I'm trying next. They have deep-fried flour tortilla chips nicely dusted with cinnamon sugar, also known as Cinnamon Crispas from when Taco Bell had them back in the day. One of the few things I have ever loved at the Bell. Looked like they were made to order, they were certainly warm and fresh. Excellent! I'm in love again. The owner and cook are great people, too. When the people working at the Old Post Office (and the New Post Office) discover them they'll eventually have to take over most or all of the tiny building they're in. And get a bunch of delivery people.",

Happy to get some real veggies in my burrito rather than the refried beans and lettuce I'd find other places.  5 out of 5 do recommend \ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf2e\ud83e\udd51\ud83c\udf2f\ud83c\udf36",
