The first time her boss had to force her to apologize for her rudeness. Today I bought an amazing breakfast from another restaurant inside of Armature Works called [K\u016b b\u00e5]. Fantastic breakfast! Well I chose to sit by the open window seating by Graze when Heather said to me \u201cyou know our breakfast is better\u201d that is very unprofessional! I thought the restaurants were more supportive of each other and more like a family. I think they need new hired help because I don\u2019t believe her attitude will change.",

How can you kick out a family from a family place during the day??!! This place needs to be shut down  Update: And this was Graze 1910 that kicked the family out, they told the security guards and the guards even said they have to listen to the restaurant. Clearly from the owners responds. \u201cThe fish rots from the head down.\u201d Meaning you are a bad leader hence why your staff acts like this  Also, Stop blaming it on market hall, as your other reviews. Maybe start by removing Amanda . As a leader, blame your self and work on it",

Alison was too busy flirting with this guy that she ignored the fact that our food sat on the counter ready for 20 minutes. We never received a text so at first we didn\u2019t know that our food was ready. She didn\u2019t even bother to look to see who\u2019s plate was sitting on the counter. As the cook placed people\u2019s orders on the counter, she immediately called their name so they got there food. We watched her the whole time and kept wondering if that was our food sitting in the counter getting cold but we didn\u2019t get the text so we continued to wait. After 20 minutes of the food getting cold, she looks at us and asked us if that was our food sitting on the counter. At this point we are very upset because she never looked to see who\u2019s food that was. We had to wait even longer so the cook can make our food again. Alison never apologized nor did she care that we had to wait. Very poor customer service. She gave excellent customer service to the guy she was flirting with but failed to even acknowledge that there\u2019s a plate sitting on the counter unclaimed.",

Do yourself a favor and try the 1910 and Graze burger just the way they come.  Don't try building a new recipe, don't ask for sauce on the side, just enjoy the original burger the way it was meant to be.  The location and atmosphere are badass.  Sit by the open bay windows when the weather is nice and enjoy the view of downtown Tampa, plus people watching is great.  The counter and stools at the bar are elegant; you will receive full service and dinnerware if you can find a spot.

It is right next to the patio seating with games so you are able to enjoy this sitting inside, out on the bar seating or at one of the patio tables. The patio tables were very wobbly so I wouldn't recommend one until you've tested the table before sitting.  I got the Ray Ray BLT burger and I must say this burger was absolutely delicious. Would I get it again? Yes! For $9 with no sides? I don't know. The burger itself was delicious but for $9 and no sides, it kind of disappoints. There were other food vendors that offer a sandwich, drink and fries for $10 at lunch so for $9, I don't believe that I would get it again BUT it was delicious so there's sort of a mix there.  Awesome view, awesome staff and awesome food. Just missed me with the $9 price and no sides but other than that, it is a really cool joint!",

I didn't think anything of it when they didn't serve a side of syrup (it was just drizzled), but saw that one of my friends had syrup on the side. Maybe I need to ask next time. I loved the tator tots, it's packed in really tight so that when you bite into it, you get a full bite of potato and not just...pieces of shredded potatoes.",

A true crowd pleaser too - from burger lovers to brunch babes, vegan selection is super tasty, flavored milk shakes and ice pops for the kids, beer and champs for Mommy and Daddy (because, kids) and salads for that power lunch (side of tots because, life). Everything we've had was 5-star review worthy. We've been fans since day one and keep going back for more.  Side note: the owners are local and really good people. You can tell Graze is their baby in the quality of the food and the smiles in the service. We love this place.",
