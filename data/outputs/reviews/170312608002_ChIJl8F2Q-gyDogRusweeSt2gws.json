It was our first time having ribs and they were the star of the meal, very delicious and the BBQ sauce was amazing. The chicken was decent. The brisket was a huge disappointment, although it was tender it was also bland, tasteless, and also unappealing, almost like it was boiled.  For the sides we got rice and beans (subpar), corn and beans (average but enjoyable), baked potato (nothing special, just a potato that\u2019s baked), onion rings (crispy, golden, and delicious), and lastly Macaroni and cheese (basically Kraft powder cheese sauce, enjoyable)  Overall I really enjoyed our visit, the ribs is the reason we\u2019re going back. We are going to try some different dishes this time. If Ribs are what you\u2019re looking for, highly recommend this place, brisket not so much.",

They brought me my meal to the car. The food was delicious. It is like a Texas BBQ and the sauce is so good. I got brisket, chicken, and ribs.

Portions are generous and the service is very friendly.  It's BYOB!  A great place to sit outside on a warmer day (inside gets a bit too hot during the summer as it's not air conditioned).  We've done take out a few times and loved it.  They need a website for easier ordering and so that their menu is online.  Food: Generally very good to excellent, but not world class (not that I would expect world-class at this price point!).  The BBQ sauce used (there appears to be at least two different types) is more towards the tangy end and is very good, but not perfect.  Brisket was very good, Ribs were excellent (less tangy), sweet potato fries are amazing.  The Nachos appetizer is very large and excellent.  I haven't experienced enough of Worcester yet to say for sure, but I have a feeling this place is in contention for best BBQ in the city.  I would rate it very favorably compared to most of the BBQ places I was familiar with in Boston (recently moved).  Atmosphere: Most seating during the summer is outside on the front patio.  It can get a bit loud as Pleasant St. is fairly busy, but the neighborhood is nice and conversation is still easy.  Occasionally, some people smoking at the nearby coffee shop have caused some annoyance (smoke drifting over).  Inside has a couple of booths and a TV.  I've never eaten inside, but it seems like it would be nice, albeit with less atmosphere, when the weather dictates indoor eating.  Note: there is a nearby liquor store which has chilled wine/beer for sale at non-crazy prices.",

The baked beans & cornbread weren't just good they were AMAZING! The setup is a little weird if you've never been before, they do have an inside to the restaurant but it very small. Most of the seating is outside which was enjoyable. You also have to bring your own alcoholic drinks if you want them (there is a liquor store next door). This is about an hour drive for me, but I will definitely be back one day!",
