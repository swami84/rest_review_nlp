There are so many good pizza places nearby that unfortunately this doesn't hold up even as your neighborhood slice joint.  The staff is friendly and the location is convenient, so hopefully they step it up -- I'd love to come back and up my rating to 5 stars",

They are extremely friendly there, and welcoming to children. They even offered to cut up our slices into smaller pieces so my kiddos could enjoy their slices more easily. They are located in the lower level of the market line in the Essex market. I just love it there and we will definitely be back. Ps. Their cannoli is realllyy delicious.",
