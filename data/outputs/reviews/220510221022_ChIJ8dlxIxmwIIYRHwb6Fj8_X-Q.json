Last time I visited, the fries were raw and limp.  Order 3 things and count on at least 1 of them not being correct in some manner of form.  I'm confused about these food pictures that I see posted because mine never looks anything like that when I'm stuck here.  These are most likely shill reviewers.  The food is nothing like this.  We some how wish this place would shut down so we could be sent somewhere; about anywhere, else for our stay and especially our meals.",
