We found a nearby coffee place on google, but it was full when we got there, so we went here instead. After a few minutes, our friend commented \"wow, I'm glad that other place was full!\" And I agreed. We got a cappuccino, mocha, and latte, along with two bao and a taco (we were just snacking). Everything was absolutely delicious and generously sized. The instant we arrived we were greeted with a friendly welcome, water, and menus, and they checked for our orders very quickly and brought our coffee as soon as could be. The coffees are $3-4 a piece, and the tacos are the same. We had to wait a little bit for the taco and bao, but they brought out some chips and salsa for us while we waited! I was so impressed and the chips just made our day, honestly. We were way hungrier than we realized. It seems like a real family place with very friendly, helpful, kind people. We are planning to make a special trip down to lincoln square to visit this place for a proper meal!",
