I called Jimmy Johns and ordered a sandwich and the employee over the phone asked where I live and I gave her the address and location and she was not sure if they deliver to that address. I told it was hardly 2 miles from the store and she put me on hold and after a minute she asked for the address again. I gave her the address and she said she is not sure if they deliver and she told she will check with someone and she put me on hold. It was almost 5 minutes i was on hold and I hung up. I was frustrated with the customer service. I hated the attitude and service. Poor-Fair is generous rating.",

However, this St. Louis downtown branch was far disappointing to me. It took forever to deliver my sandwiches; It seems like they are short of delivery guys all the time. The average waiting hour would fall around between 30 m and 1 h. Many times during their business hours, they just don't even bother picking up their phone. Even when they do receive phone calls by scarce chance, they could not possibly be any more rude. When you ask them nicely to repeat what they said, they get very hysterical and start yelling at you. The employees don't even know which month September was so I had to repeat my credit card number over and over. I guess he didn't know September would be 09 on the card. My overall experience with this store? VERY BAD.",
