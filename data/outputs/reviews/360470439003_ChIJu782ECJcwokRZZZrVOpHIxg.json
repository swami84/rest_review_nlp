It's literally a food truck that sets up on an inactive railroad track with tables, chairs, canopies, & mostly caters to the local business districts in the area.  Totally worth it!  Bring cash, your appetite, and enjoy the heat of their super oily tacos & birria (beef broth soup).  I'd gladly return here with my coworkers when they're craving good tacos.
