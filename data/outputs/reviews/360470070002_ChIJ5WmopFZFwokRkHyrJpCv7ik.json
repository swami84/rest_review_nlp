The eggplant with basil combines tender chunks of eggplant and veggies drowned in an umami sauce spiked with anise pungency of fried Thai basil leaves.

Dinner prices is about 1.5\u00d7- 2x but bigger portion.My fiance and I love this place and order their dumplings and fish cakes as appetizers. Our favorite dishes is green curry, pad Thai,  and pineapple fried rice. Their lanoi float which is Thai iced tea with ice cream is a must. I think the only thing I would like to see improved is the consistency of hours. Most of the time we want to go,  they are closed or on vacation which is disappointing.Other than that,  they are great and deserve 5 stars!",

My glass of water never was empty and the food came as soon as their kitchen finished. Everything was steaming hot and delicious.  We ordered the calamari and curry puffs. Calamari was fried extremely well, only complaint is that the sauce wasn\u2019t enough. The curry puff was flaky and puffy with a mild curry flavor.  I ordered green curry and it had a nice spice to it. It wasn\u2019t as sweet as some other thai places, but there was still a ton of flavor. The ingredients were plentiful and the portion was large.  For dessert, we tried the sticky rice. honestly, it\u2019s a super different, probably niche dessert where the sweetness comes exclusively from the mangos. I wish they gave more coconut sauce, but it was still tasty!  Overall, great place for thai food around Bay Ridge. Looking forward to coming again!",

I even got complementary mango ice cream! Don't be fooled by the drab outside storefront exterior; the inside is very ornamental and homely.

I mean, even for a spicy lover. However, super flavorful and delicious. They give like 2 pieces of shrimp in this which were just as good.  Drunken Noodles with Shrimp ($12)- 5/5 The woman on the phone recommended this, and it surely didn't disappoint. It had a decent amount of shrimp and was filling.
