I had fish cake, curry/ roti, fish (fried snapper)/ spinach rice and I also ordered patties and cheese rolls (all tried at different times)\u2014 everything was perfectly made. I also made note of their great customer service skills, which is rare at a lot of Caribbean restaurants. I hope the service and good food remains the same.",
