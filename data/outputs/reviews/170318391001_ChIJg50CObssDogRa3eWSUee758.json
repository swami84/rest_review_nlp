It was Fantastic .. but was an entire chicken with a side of broccoli. This was a meal we both could have shared! There was no way my friend could have eaten the entire meal.

The food was explosively flavorful, the wine was potently delicious, and the seating was perfect (we got to sit upstairs right by a beautiful display with perfect lighting). Best of all was the service provided by our server, Webster, whose table-side manner was truly exceptional. Webster's impressively extensive menu knowledge, his attentive, jovial personality, and his keen ability to recommend menu items that are different yet ideally suited to a newcomer's palate, are just a few of the traits that make him an outstanding server. It is not surprising that Webster was originally trained as a chef! (I suggest you ask to sit in his section when you go there!) In the same vein, everyone from the door host to other waitstaff who consistently came to check on how we were doing (not to mention the fabulous chefs) contributed to our phenomenal dining experience. (We had a little too much fun and my date left his bag at the venue, which was also handled with utmost efficiency and professionalism). Even after frequenting several of the best steak-houses in downtown Chicago and elsewhere, I would have to say that my Rosebud Prime dining experience was honestly the best I have had to date.",

The hostess was extremely rude to us when we walked in at 3:00 PM when there was literally 10 people in the restaurant. She gave us a hard time about not having reservations and asked us to step aside, for no one. After she made her point we were seated at about the worst table in the empty restaurant and when we asked if we could sit in one of the 12 empty booths she rudely claimed they were reserved. About 10 minutes later she sat another couple at a table who, after about 5 minutes, decided they wanted to move to a booth and she happily obliged (wth). We must have come between shifts because everyone was really hesitant to serve us for about 15 minutes until someone finally stepped up and helped us out. After the fiasco at the at the beginning of the experience, the food and service was good. It\u2019s unfortunate that we felt like our money (A LOT as it turned out) was no good here when we walked in. Also, all booths were still empty when we left.",

Then it went down hill.  The escargot appetizer fell WAY short. Probably the worst I have ever had. Too much oil, no salt and generally no flavor at all. The bread served with it was way too cooked and may as well been crushed and served as croutons. The spinach salad was very poor as well. I have had way better spinach salads at many other places.  The dressing lacked flavor and the salad itself was cumbersome to eat.  Not sure about you all but I like the stems taken off my spinach leaves. For the price of the salad it should of been. Overall, I was left very unimpressed and can name a dozen restaurants within a mile I would go to before here again.",
