They ask that you place your entire order at once which is very typical in Chicago and I have no issue doing so. However their phasing was HORRENDOUS. The appetizers came out almost immediately which was great, but then we had rice, noodles, and two main dishes that came out five minutes later all at once for a group of 3. We weren't even through eating the appetizers. We ended up sending half of it back and asking that it be properly phased (which I must admit the staff was perfectly happy to do so). The egg roll had an extremely thick crust and was so deep fried and greasy it was a bit off putting, the crab rangoon filling was runny with no indication of crab to be found. The Kung Pao chicken was fine- but nothing to write home about. The Mongolian beef was also fine, though the peppers were undercooked and the meat was extremely salty. The fried rice was different.. not much soy sauce and a little on the sweet side. The true star was the Lo Mein which had homemade noodles and a perfect sauce. Overall, a disappointing experience though it could have partially to do with high expectations going in.",
