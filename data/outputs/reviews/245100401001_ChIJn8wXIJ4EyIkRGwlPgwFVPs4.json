When I tried to count the chicken since I have been shorted at the other store the woman started chewing me out and told me to get out of the way so she can give the next person their order.

Me and my date was smashed and pushed by 50 people threw two doors like slaves on a ship. This could have easy be avoided by staff out side controling the lines at the door. With no control at the front door it took 2 hr to get into the show. We missed a lot of the show. We got thier at 8:10 wit show starting at 9, but did not get in till 10. This is total unacceptable plus it was raining, I will never spend a dime going to a show thier in live! They let mobs of people cut the line which slow the entire process up.

Last visit (around midnight) they had large signs advertising their $1 iced tea special.  Of course when I went in the iced tea was out.  I asked the cashier if they could make some.  He had a strange wide-eyed look so I asked him again.  He then shouted to the girl, \"Can you make iced tea?\"  She responded, \"I don't know how.\"  He looked at me & said \"I don't know how to either.\" Frustrated, I asked if I could use the restroom, located under the giant \"RESTROOMS\" sign, which was locked.  Wide eyed again he said \"It's closed.\"  I have used this restroom many times before while buying drinks & snacks.  When I asked if he was serious he repeated, \"It's closed.\" There is no excuse that the only employees in a store don't know how do serve customers.  And I understand that homeless people probably use their restroom to give themselves baths, but there surely is a way that you can provide access to actual customers.",
