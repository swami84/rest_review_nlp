Let me stress that the swordfush is served in a bowl of white sauce at it was overcooked and bone dry. The tamales were also very dry. The swordfish is served in a white sauce that had no seasoning. Although the small portions of pork belly as part of the swordfish main was very flavorful. And the seasoned tomatoes with the tamales was also tasty. The drinks were great in flavor but were skimpy on the booze.  I did express to the waitstaff that both entrees were very overcooked and dry. She did give us a free desert. I didnt make a fuss it was just given to us. The dessert was the only flavorful part of the meal. Verry overpriced for the food. There are many many (like over 10) authentic mexican and south american restaurants on the same street that have way better food for a fraction of the cost that actually know how to season their dishes. I would say that this restaurant is a waste of time considering thier area and type of food. I will also add for 24$ for less than 4 oz of swordfish is very skimpy. The three giant chuncks of uncooked celery on my main was a waste i didnt order buffalo wings.",

I decided to try it again, and went in with my boyfriend to have dinner there. We ordered oysters, with several appetizers and drinks. We like to eat tapas style. The bill came out to about $70. But the waitress basically ruined the meal for us. What felt like every 10 minutes, she would come over and try to pressure us to buy 'mains.' We said we were ordering appetizers and she came back again and again to ask if we'd changed our minds and wanted mains. It was incredibly annoying and felt like she was shaming us for enjoying the $1 oyster offer and wanted us to order more so she could get a larger tip. It was bizarre and I couldn't get the word mains out of my head for like a day",

We asked for salt and pepper once our food came out and after putting salt on everything realized that we had been given sugar instead. Not wanting to be jerks about it we kindly let our waitress know about the mistake and rather than apologizing she joked 'oh you wanted salt?'. We weren't offered replacement meals or given a discount on our bill. Needless to say I was incredibly disappointed in the service. I really can't comment on the quality of most of the food because it was covered in sugar but the few appetizers we had before the sugar came out were quite good.",

Our waitress for some reason, as this was a hard drink to make said \u201cI have to check if we can make it\u201d. First off, what are you making? The lemon? The coke? I don\u2019t know. Then my friend and wife orders their drinks. Moscow Mule tasted like a limeade, not a drip of alcohol. Shirley Temple was pretty much all grenadine. The menu was very confusing to understand. I understand it\u2019s a tapas style restaurant but give more options for people that live in the area that can afford. I order the Tacos Carnitas and honestly the tacos looked just sad. Not only that but it\u2019s one 2 for $10. If I pay that much. Fill it with meat. There was more salsa and sauce than meat. My friend orders the fried potatoes and it comes with a sauce, which she dropped and I know, our fault, we were very sorry and offered to clean but the waitress cleaned. However, as my friend went to use the bathroom, the waitress cleaned it with my friends napkin ... why? AND she never gave her a clean one back. We had to ask for it. Anyways, this place was just a downer. I know we have bad days and it\u2019s Sunday, few hours before you close but doesn\u2019t give you the right to be so serious. $116 later, the only thing that was appealing was the oysters. But than again, how can you mess that up! I love trying out my local places being from Somerville and living around. But I\u2019d choose a different Mexican place around broadway, with a lot better and cheaper authentic food.",

The decor is warm and rustic, super Somervillian. The staff are AMAZING - knowledgable, friendly, patient. The food is amazing - the baked pancake at brunch changed my world, and I've replicated the sweet potato dish at home several times yet it's never as good. Also GREAT cocktails. I nearly had my wedding reception here, and I'm sure it would have been awesome. La Brasa is somehow cozy enough for 2 and spacious enough for a party of 8. Can't wait to go back!!",

While reading the menu, I was ready to dislike the somewhat pretentious sounding dishes: individual chicken wings with snails, 5 dollar street-style tacos, and etc.  We ended up getting a medley of food to try, and it was a fun experiment in flavors.  One of the items was table-side prime rib, sliced by a very knowledgeable and friendly staff member.  My favorite dish was the salmon which sat on top of a delicious salad of Thai basil and other fresh tasting greens and fruits. I enjoyed our dinner here, and I would highly recommend it!",

Our reservation was at 7:15pm  and when we arrived at 7:17pm and realized there was no table available for our group, we got yelled at for not being on time by a very condescending woman. 2 minutes late at a restaurant still feels really on time.  Our table did not become available before 7:45pm i.e. 30 minutes after the reservation time so we asked if the restaurant could do something nice about it and eventually pay for the drinks we ordered at the bar while waiting. Once again the waitress was extremely rude and talked down to us saying we should expect restaurant to be busy on Saturday and calling one of the guest out for being a \u201cbabe\u201d in a very condescending way.  The manager didn\u2019t care at all about our situation despite our complains and stayed seated at the bar gossiping about us in a very unprofessional manner.  I would not recommend this place to anyone who expects to be treated nicely at a restaurant.",

The beef in the beef tamale was a beautifully cooked slab of brisket but it was too large to be properly seasoned. In contrast, the tuna tostada had so many flavors competing that the tuna was lost. The romaine salad was very nice but the roast chicken was tiny for the price (more like a breaded chicken tender, sliced) but delicious. We loved the chicken liver mousse and we loved the fresh brown bread but the two together we're an odd pairing. The roast carrots looked good but never arrived and had to be taken off the bill, one of several missteps in service. My drink was great but the lime garnish had been cut yesterday and was starting to brown. Perhaps that's the best summary of the restaurant: great ideas but poor attention to the details of execution ultimately hurt the experience.",

It feels like a new restaurant that hasn't exactly figured out everything quite yet. The menu items sound pretty impressive and has some high quality ingredients. Some items were great but some not so great. The duck legs and fried rice dish were pretty spot on, but other dishes were either bland or extremely overly seasoned/salted.  Overall, it is fairly small portioned and expensive food that is attempting to be more higher-end than it is. You'll even have to pay for dinner rolls. I think with a little recipe tuning and slightly larger portions, it could be great.",

We ordered the bread (ended up ordering two orders of it in the end!), with the ash butter and the ricotta with olives to start. I ordered the seabass which was amazing to say the least and my friend ordered the rib that was going around. The waiters were attentive and were extremely punctual. The smokiness of the food was evident from their way of cooking. The dessert was delicious. Safe to say we didnt leave anything behind. I have to say though if you're a picky eater and not into trying new palates and flavours this isn't the place for you. Also, the menu is limited so make sure you've looked at it before you decide to go. Definitely would go there again!",

Apps were delivered to our table that were not ours. We had our eggplant app delivered to a different table. Water refills were non-existent (BYOWB - bring your own water bottle!). Only one person received a refill on their beverage and a second person ordered wine that never showed up. Entree order was taken very late. Entrees were ok. Finished and sat again for a long time. Half the table was bussed. Then we declined dessert and asked for the check. Waiter came back about 10 mins later and asked if we wanted dessert. Said no just check. Check was wrong.

The burnt salad was ridiculously small and almost laughable.  The dressing was too heavy and made the lettuce very soggy.  We also found that the seasoning was sparse and most of the meal was flavorless.  We had a few plates that we shared - the servers asked us every 5 minutes if we wanted more food - pushing us to order more.  We were so frustrated by the lack of flavors that we left after having only a few dishes.  I am surprised by all the amazing reviews that I have read online.

The menu is collection of carefully constructed seasonal dishes, which are all served tapas style. I'm a fan of the sharing plate because it means I get to try more dishes. The place is also a must for brunch (try the pickled eggs!) and I makes the best espresso coffees in Boston.",

It was served with escargot brown butter and actually still had pieces of the escargot (that's snails if you didn't know). The cocktails are also delicious and inventive. You can't go wrong with having the bartender make you something off-menu either. Next door, they have a small coffee shop and market selling local artisanal products.",

We had: grilled chicken, which was the most tender chicken I've ever had...almost weirdly so; the tacos, which were fantastic; lamb kebabs which were the most wood fire thing we got, and were quite good; and affogato for dessert, which wasn't the best--the coffee tasted a little too roasted or something (which was surprising given that reviews tout the excellent coffee), but was on the whole pretty good still. The waiter was a bit awkward and eager, like he's new to waiting tables, though everyone else who came to the table was pleasant. We were informed while ordering that the dining style is tapas, so be ready for smaller portions for entree prices. Ideal for a special occasion if you're looking for a more relaxed atmosphere.",
