She also hung up on me no surprise there coming from her. I called again & thankfully this time I got a nice guy on the phone. I told him what happened & he said to call back tomorrow to speak to the manager. At least he listened. You better believe I will call back! Stay tuned!  Update-*WOW*\u203c\ufe0f \ud83d\ude33 I\u2019m left speechless by the encounter that I had with the manager. I called to speak to her & she was so mad at me apparently she already knew about the situation, according to her. She didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain & she spoke over me. Oh-& here is the best part-she came for my other reviews she even mentioned that I gave my therapist a bad review-that\u2019s a very low blow. I\u2019m glad I know the type of person running this restaurant; that\u2019s showing your true colors right there. I could probably go on & on but I know that it\u2019s not worth it. And I wont let someone like that get the best of me\u2014that\u2019s for sure!  Shoutout to Joe one of the delivery drivers-who has been nice to me & didn\u2019t all of a sudden change being nice for no reason at all like others at this restaurant. I sometimes pass by there when shopping so maybe I\u2019ll see him again. & God bless him because I know that he has been having medical issues. Not sure if he\u2019ll see this review I hope he does though but I\u2019m definitely keeping him in my prayers!! And always remember folks-\u201cSpread love not hate & What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger!!**\ud83d\ude0a",

Currently observing the governor's stay-at-home order and got the vodka pie 2 weeks in a row. Ohhh mama. So freaking good. Husband and I are huge fans.  I was delivered the wrong pie today and called to make sure I was charged properly ($6 difference between what I ordered and what I got). I was going to eat it anyway and just try for the vodka pie next week, but they insisted on fixing the mistake despite my saying it was okay. So now I have extra pizza.

It had good, homey food, friendly service and reasonable prices. The day after an exhausting catering job, my wife and I decided to try Luliano's....we are very glad we did. The restaurant no longer has the side room which, though spacious, always seemed a bit of an afterthought--too bright, lacking the warmth of the main dining area. The bar has been shortened and, I'm happy to say, one of the two TV monitors is gone. The remaining room seems pretty much as it was, but the food is more elegant than Giacomo's. The kitchen has a different focus and  higher ambitions; less homey and more refined. They turned out dishes that my wife and I, both professional chefs, would be proud to serve to our friends and family, (though she said our shared Pesto Risotto with Clams & Shrimp was perfectly cooked, I prefer a bit more bite in my rice dishes. A fairly minor quibble and not so important as to ruin a fine meal. The prices are higher than the old establishment's, but not outrageous. Service was attentive and crisp. The focaccia in our bread basket was excellent. The wine list has changed, too. My wife chose a reasonably priced Chianti that was fruity and complex-quite delicious to go with a very, very good meal. We will be back often.",

I don\u2019t know how they make their red sauce but I\u2019m going to ask for that secret recipe the next time I\u2019m in there. For desert I had Tartufo (I loved how they put it in a cute little glass bowl) and I also tried some of my brothers Tiramisu which was out of this world.

So we strolled our way to the corner table by the front windows. We had a standard infant stroller with our sleeping baby in it. We glided it to fit in between our table and another in this, again, empty restaurant. As we just sat down, the waitress or maybe hostess, dryly advised us to move to the table in the center because \"It's just better that way\", with small implication to the stroller. No apologies for the possible inconvenience or a sense of care. Confused by this suggestion, we automatically felt bothered. We sat down in the new table and proceeded to order and eat. Food was good, not fantastic; yet the service was nice with the kind waitress we had (NOT the hostess with the strange musical chair suggestion).  Also, I waited to see if perhaps they had a large party with reservations; and maybe that is why we were moved. No, that was not it. There was a table of two that entered while we were in the middle of dinner. No large parties. We were moved for pretty much no reason. And yes, I was bothered by that. And YES, I will not be returning for that reason. I rather spend money and eat at a place where I feel welcomed and not ordered around because someone felt like it.",

Then our cousins from out of town came to see us on a rainy Saturday afternoon. We wanted to take them to our trusted place in the neighborhood, but the place was packed with a 40 minutes wait. Not wanting to waste time, we decided to walk over to Giacomo's. We were seated right away, the staff were all very friendly and welcoming. There was five of us and we all shared our plates. My appetizer was a delicious fried calamari that was lightly fried and tasty, everyone really liked it. Our main dish was a full pie of pizza that no problem in quickly dissapearing from its try. I forget what our cousins irdered, but I remember the satisfied look in their faces. The place is very casual and relaxed. It is affordable as well and I truly plan to go back and also place orders for delivery from them.",

It took them forever to come back to our table. The service seemed disjointed, disorganized, and inattentive. The pizza came and it was just alright. Absolutely nothing to write home about. With as many pizza places as there are in Bay Ridge, I see no reason why I'd ever come back.",
