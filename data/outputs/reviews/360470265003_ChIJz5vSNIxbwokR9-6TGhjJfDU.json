The inside is spacious as well. Big community table to work at, window seats, bathroom. Oh, and did I mention she gets DOUGH donuts?! ;) UPDATE**** Their backyard grill is now open for business and it is so good!!!! Authentic Caribbean food with some American classics thrown in there. They have beer but feel free to bring your own, or some wine. Either way, always good and this new menu is amazing!",
