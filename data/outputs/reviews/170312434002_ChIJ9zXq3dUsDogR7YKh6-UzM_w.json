The sashimi came with fresh cut wasabi in addition to the regular wasabi all restaurants have, which was a nice touch. The staff and owner were nice and the food was well made.  I have worked in sushi restaurants before and I can tell you that the cuts I received were thick and the portion sizes were very reasonable for the price. Depending on how hungry you are, entrees are about $20+, while sushi would be about $25+ a person.  The atmosphere is casual and pretty. If you want fresh and good quality fish, give it a shot.",

It must be incredibly hard to stay positive as a restaurant owner right now, but Tsujiki Fish Market has nothing to be afraid of. In just 2 hours, their flavorful food and friendly atmosphere became my new favorite sushi hub in the neighborhood.  My friend and I basically ordered the whole menu: Edamame, Seaweed Salad, Octopus, Tako Yaki, Gyoza, and 4 oustanding rolls; the Fat Buddah, the Volcano, the Creamy Spicy Tako, and the Ocean Jalapeno. Every new bite we took was better than the last. You can absolutley tell these rolls are made with skilled hands and the culinary team knows whats up!  Thanks for the kind hospitality and good eats! I'll be back :)",

My friend and I shared the tako yaki and kimo (chicken liver) skewer. I usually order the okonomiyaki when I get carry out- it's a good sized order...I can get 2 or 3 servings from it. I've tried the salmon volcano aburi nigiri, Alaska roll, crazy roll, and island roll all of which are so good. I almost always order the salmon volcano aburi and the crazy roll. One time I ordered a bento box for pickup and wasn't able to pick up the food I ordered until 2 or 3 hours later than what I had scheduled.  The restaurant called me to check if I was still going to pick up my food which was sweet, considering I had already paid for the food. When I got there to pick up the food, the employee who handed me the food told me they had remade the food for me so it would be fresh. How amazing is that??  Street parking isn't too tough to find. Most of it is not free. I'm not sure how busy the restaurant usually gets. It usually seems empty when I'm there to pickup food so I'm guessing most of the business is delivery/carryout orders.",

We ordered couple of appetizers, I have been on a hunt for an okonomiyake a Japanese seafood vegetable pancake with a savory Japanese mayo and this place delivered! It was delicious that it reminded me of how my aunt with make it, the takoyaki another appetizer it\u2019s like a squid ball fluffy and delicate was tasty and just pure yum in my belly! We also had sushi/sashimi bento and a pork tonkatsu bento both has side salad very refreshing and generous side with cup of rice and miso sou! This place has a sense of authentic Japanese food with wide variety and selection! We will be back to try more of what the restaurant had to offer. Oh btw it\u2019s street parking. And a little pricey but it is worth it!",

Then waited another 20 minutes for a simple beef curry rice fish, which never came.  Despite repeated questions about where the food was, they kept saying it was coming (It was not) and offered no explanation as to what was taking so long.  Eventually I told them I was leaving, and when pressed they admitted they were putting delivery orders that came in after my order on priority.  Worst dining experiance in 3 years living in Chicago. The food was okay, but after the service I'd prefer gas station sushi any day.",

Only ate few pieces. I ordered sushi set. Omg. Too much rice. You know how sushi buffets have lot of rice to fill you up? Well, this place had more rice than those places. And the fish was so dry. One of the fish melted in my mouth... not in a good way. My friend had ramen and it was okay. We had so much leftovers.  Overall, the sushi was worst I ever had and over priced.",

To my surprise, right up the road is a unassuming restaurant that claims to be a fish market. When I walked in I briefly glanced over the menu & asked\" How often do you get a fish delivery?\" The woman replied \"Everyday.\" What restaurant wouldn't say that? The ambiance was warm, carefully decorated and very intimate. So, I gave it a try. Boy, did I make the right decision. I have been eating sushi for 27 years and sampled the best from all over the globe. If a sushi bar has poor Uni, then most likely, all the fish will be poor. Am, our waitress, was attentive and I never had an empty water glass. You are going to need it when you taste Chef's handmade wasabi. This is priceless. The fish was outstanding..fresh, crisp and sweet. The Uni melted in my mouth and the Sashimi was tender & flavorful.  From the Uni, to the fresh cracked crab legs. The portions were filling and the presentation was too beautiful to eat. Can somebody please call Anthony Bourdain? If you want to eat at Chicago's best kept secret, make this a travel destination. I have to go to confession as the food was that sinful!",
