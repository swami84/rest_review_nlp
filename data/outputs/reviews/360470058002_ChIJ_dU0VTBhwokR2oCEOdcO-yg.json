Salmon was super fresh, avocado was perfectlyrics spiced, arugula on the side with just yum sauce (i wish it was a lil more arugula, though, love it!) and red caviar on top was just the bomb! All things I love at the same plate! For dessert I took Olive oil Banana flan cake, delicious too. Oh, and don't forget to take mango mint iced tea! Yum! Highly recommend to visit this place!

I was about to bring him to a diner in Bay Ridge to order from the breakfast menu, but I wanted to try a different restaurant for a change.  The Common has a separate breakfast/brunch menu and a lunch/dinner menu.  When we entered, the place was warm and inviting.  I was immediately impressed by the four men cooking in the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.  The decor had a natural, woodsy feel to it.  I ordered the Mediterranean Omelet.  It was very well-presented with a side of arugula salad covered with a tasty house dressing.  The dish was delicious.  My son ordered a three-grain bowl which included pulled pork, avocado, radish, pickled onions, cilantro, and a poached egg.  The three grains consisted of quinoa, brown rice, and bulgur.  My son who is now a teen and doesn't talk much appeared to have a very enjoyable time eating this dish.  The total bill for our meal was comparable to what we would have been charged had we had breakfast at the nearby diner.  However, this place was a few notches higher in quality than a diner.  The menu offered a lot of variety as well as interesting dishes.  Some items that stood out were pastrami grilled cheese, mango mint iced tea, breakfast nachos, and avocado smoothies.  I definitely want to return here to check out the dinner menu.",

Delicious -- a bit tough to get through the crusted rim of the toast but manageable with the steak knife provided. Coffee was phenomenal, staff and service were top class.  They do not take reservations, and parties larger than 2 will really roll the dice here after 10am weekdays and any time Sat/Sun, but it is genuinely tasty, nice decor, open kitchen, and worth a little wait time if you're in the south Bay Ridge/Ft Hamilton area.",

The cappuccino was smooth and delicious and our meals were phenomenal. The menu wasn't huge but it didn't need to be. The food options were healthy with that mix of something fried with flavors and textures absolutely balanced. The lavender and honey cheesecake was light buth with distinguished flavors. The atmosphere was cozy and charming, and the techno beat playing somehow made it better for me. I'll definitely be going back to try their other foods and so should you! Absolutely loved it!",

I was surprised to see what healthy/high quality options were on the menu and how they were nothing like what I assumed this place to be. I immediately invited my partner to join me for lunch and we were completely blown away with our order. We ordered the chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The order is completely customizable (as we added avocado, and the sauce on the side to taste first). Everything came out in a timely manner and you could taste the quality of food throughout every bite. We will absolutely be coming here again to try another item on the menu. This place exceeded my expectations!",
