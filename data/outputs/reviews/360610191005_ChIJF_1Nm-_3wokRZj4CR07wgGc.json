Service was prompt, excellent, warm and welcoming as well as the restaurant being spotlessly clean.  My friend served two tours of duty in Vietnam and stated this restaurant was better and more authentic than any food he had during his service in Vietnam.  Who cares if it is Chinese-owned (which was a ridiculous criticism by another customer) - here the chef is Vietnamese.  We highly recommend Miss Saigon and will try to get there often.  They deserve five stars.",

We were enjoying them until I decided to try the grilled chicken soup my daughter was eating.  I selected a piece of the grilled chicken to try and as I bit into it something cut my gums.  At first I thought it might be a piece of bone, but when placed on a paper towel and examined, it proved to be a staple.  A staple.  See image.  The gentleman on the phone was very apologetic but I can only wonder what would have happened had it been swallowed.  Clearly not safe.",
