On top of that, the other soup container was broken and leaking when it arrived. Biggest cheapskate Korean restaurant we have tried here in Chicago. At least the kimchi and spicy soup was OK.",

It seems like it was because I only ordered one six dogs. If the original Yukgaejang contains noodles, isn't it necessary to pack it separately when ordered? I didn't understand something hehe.. I asked for it separately, not add it at the moment, but I added 2 dollars.

The jajangmyeon noodles were very sticky and difficult to mix, the black bean noodle sauce was bitter when I thought it would be sweeter... my husband got a chicken entree and he hated it as well and the sides that come with the entrees were super tiny and wrapped in foil. Not sides more like samples of food. The pros were that the food was fast and ordering online was easy. Unfortunately we won\u2019t be back and probably won\u2019t try Korean food again.",

The Mushroom Soup was good but seemed tomato based as it was red in color and didn't have a strong mushroom flavor due to the stock base. The rice cakes were really good. So we had a reso and it took about 10 minutes before anyone even came to the host stand. It was around 10 minutes for someone to give us water. It was around 20 minutes after that to even ask about ordering food. We received the food before the beer and soju and the server just apologized and said they forgot. We had to ask for the 2nd beer again to be delivered at the end of the meal. The Soju was cleared with plenty left in the bottle without asking. We ordered  several entrees and one came with Miso that was not delivered until we asked for to go boxes and mentioned it. The response was surprisingly \"Oh, did you want that?\" Really wanted to like this place. For just the few tables and several servers on the floor and the great reviews I guess I just expected a better experience.",

The second one was the soup in the Dinner For 2 which was seafood, and the mussels and crabs felt old. They felt as they were putting into the freezer for many days and unfreeze when customers order. The third one was the Chicken Bulgogi  which was way too sweet to eat, and the chicken meat was too little, and the dish was full of white onion, green onion.",

The kimchee was delicious as well.  The staff were responsive and the delivery was on time.  I know they have made it to my short list of catering choices in the future - really great meal!",

I've been here a few times and have tried the bulgogi, bibimbap, seafood pancake, stir fried squid and pork, jjajangmyun, and a couple of the soups. Out of the things I've tried, the soups are the best and most flavorful. The stir fried squid and pork wasn't bad either, because it was smothered in sauce. Unfortunately everything else is quite bland. The banchan is tasteless and so is the bibimbap (like c'mon how do you mess this up?). The jjajangmyun literally had no salt or flavor and the mucky black bean sauce was pretty gross actually. The bulgogi was really tough and overcooked, and the seafood pancake wasn't salty enough either.  One good thing is that if you dine in, you can you can fill out a form for your email and birthday, which they will keep track of and send you a $25 off coupon when it's almost your birthday. I believe they do ask for an ID when you come in to redeem it.  I do think that the portions are decently large and the service is pretty standard of what you'd expect in Chinatown. But there are so many more better options around this restaurant. And if you want good Korean food, you'd have better luck going somewhere up north.",

Booths felt individualized while still being close together.  Food was delicious. Probably the best for the price on a Wednesday as well. Wednesdays is HALF OFF ALL Dinner-for-2 specials. Extremely worth it for value. Only ordered two items, but both were enough to fill for 2-3 people. Grilled Pork Belly Dinner-for-2, and Kalbi Dolsot. For the Grilled Pork Belly, I suggest keeping it tender/softer. It was a bit hard to go through. Kalbi was great. Side dishes were enough for 2, lots of variety.  Sauce. The sauce was spectacular according to my girlfriend. Perfect for the Kalbi dish. It's a special bibimbap house blend I believe after talking to staff. (Red bottle in photos)  Service was overall great. Enough staff for the restaurant. Small suggestions would be for more attention to water (not even a big deal). The restaurant was not extremely busy so there was no reason to rush services.  Wednesdays are probably the best days for eating bang-for-buck. I recommend pairing the Grilled Pork Belly with the Kalbi Dolsot. The price came out less than $33! (See photos)",

I stopped here and was delighted with what I found. Great honest kind service. Food served fast with a smile. Recommendations that are honest and insightful. I started with the sweet & spicy chicken wings. Crisp and coated with this super sticky tasty sauce. Absolutely delicious.\u00a0 The sauce doesn't make the wings coating all soggy. Be warned the sauce is super sticky. You will need to wash your hands before touching anything else or starting the next course but believe me it is worth it for the little bit of trouble. I moved on to Beef Bulgogi with a side of white rice. Yum yum yum! Tender meat and a plethora of sides.\u00a0 Potatoes and carrots, spicy kimchi,\u00a0 cucumber is sweet sauce, bean sprouts on sesame oil,\u00a0 seaweed,\u00a0 broccoli and fishcake. I am not a fan of fishcake but I always try it so I'm not missing out on anything.\u00a0 The spicy kimchee got me twice. It was so good, so spicy, so crisp and amazingly delicious,\u00a0 I am didn't mind my nose running. This is a small gem starring you right on the face. After all that food I asked for a beer recommendation.\u00a0 Not one Korean working here recommended the Korean beer. They liked the Sapporo, of which I am very familiar. So Sapporo it is! I certainly want to come back, bring a friend or family to turn them on to this place. I want to come try a chicken dish next. I thoroughly enjoyed this outing which was on a whim because I needed to get out the house. I am so glad I came. Looking forward to coming again in the future. I am sorry I missed this place for such a long time. I hope never to make that mistake again. I am so stuffed.\u00a0 No shortage of food here to eat so stuff yourself with healthy sides. They give plenty.",

They're about 85% of the way there. Most of the side dishes are on par, though the kimchi dishes aren't sour enough. Jjigae is a bit too salty, Yoog-gae-jang a bit too sweet. The Chap-chae is actually even better than in Korea and the Kalgoogsoo is about \"50% authentic\", according to my Korean father-in-law. Still, I'm not complaining! This is good food, especially if you're missing Korean cooking.  Keep in mind the portion sizes are BIG. If you come with a group of people, I'd recommend ordering a bit less and sharing, i.e. 3 dishes for 4 people, since they do offer several Korean side dishes with the meal. Enjoy!",

We ordered Gimmari, Kim-chi pancakes, Jjajangmyeon, spicy pork, stir-fried kimchi-pork, and dol-sot bi-bim-bap.   Bi-bim-bap came with rock-hard tofu that was cooked days before and/or sitting in refrigerator too long.  One tofu piece was so hard, I could not even squeeze it with my fingers.  Seasoned vegetables on top were not good at all.  My wife stopped eating after few bites.  All the side dishes were bland and non-distinguishable from one to the other by taste.  My daughter who loves kim-chi pancakes refused to eat it after a bite.  Undercooked and flavor-less.  Noodle inside gimmari was overly puffy and soaked in oil.  Jjajangmyeon was ok but taste was not remotely even close to anything you would find at a Korean-Chinese restaurant.  Spicy pork and stir-fried kim-chi/pork dishes were passable but I would want to come back to eat them.  I feel like this place should trim down menu and focus on few really well made items.  I can't recommend this place at all.  Also, please consider replacing unappetizing severely scratched up white ( not-so-white ) sharing dishes you provided with appetizers.  I lost my appetite as soon I saw those dishes come with gimmari and kim-chi pancakes.",
