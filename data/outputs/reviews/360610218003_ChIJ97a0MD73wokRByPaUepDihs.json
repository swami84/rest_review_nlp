We went with two babies and toddler (who has severe food allergies) and they were so accommodating, double checking everything and sending the chef out to specifically speak with us. Great for both families and date nights. The food was outstanding. So happy to have this gem in our neighborhood!",

Had already eaten and wanted to get home, but had to pop in and check it out - had a drink, an espresso, and picked up some buratta to take home. Everything was excellent - especially the buratta, which my wife chastised me for not grabbing more of - and the ownership and staff seem great. Looking forward to a proper meal here, as the to-be-expanded menu & specials (especially the specials! I should have looked at the sandwich board and had a proper meal!) looked great, and there was a genuineness missing from a lot of the quick-cash-in type places I've seen open over these few blocks in the last ten years or so.  A fine place to stop in for an espresso and a quick drink on a lazy day as well.",
