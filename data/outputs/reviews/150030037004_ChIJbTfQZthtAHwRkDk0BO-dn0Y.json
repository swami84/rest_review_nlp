They also have a mini Indian super market inside the restaurant.  Although it is family owned and run -- I didn't really get too friendly of vibes. The staff didn't seem like they wanted us there. I even made a joke like I don't think they like us very much. We all kind of laughed about it but it wasn't really my vibe.  The food was flavorful but honestly everything was too spicy for me. I hope they can attract the crowd that they want.",

        "caption": "Did you know the area known as South India is made up of 5 states?  They are of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.  The peoples of South India comprises about 20% of India's land area.  We are lucky to have been steered to trying this regional cuisine by several Yelp Friends as we do enjoy the exotic flavors of Indian cuisine.  Sarithra's chef is from Tamil Nadu and excels at his curry spice blends.  The Indian State of Tamil Nadu is home to several historic buildings, multi-religious pilgrimage sites, hill stations, and three World Heritage sites.  There is a small parking lot attached to this location but it's a shared lot with a couple of other businesses and we've seen the lot being quite full throughout the day while passing by.  Still, it's good that they do offer free parking.  Before being seated, our temperatures were taken at the door and we were escorted to the dining area.  We completed the contact tracing form and were provided with disposable menus.  The server told us that they weren't serving the meals listed in the middle of the menu but everything else was available.  FOOD:  Both lunch plates included 1 parotta (a layered bread), vegetable curry, and white rice. -Paneer butter masala (paneer makhani)  lunch plate:  house-made cheese cubes cooked in onion, tomato sauce with spices and cream.   The butter flavor and aroma was evident as it enriched this mild curry.   $12.99  -Chicken curry lunch plate:  tender chunks of chicken cooked with onion and tomato sauce with spices and herbs.  At first taste, I thought the sauce was going to be too spicy for my taste buds as I could feel my lips tingling and beads of sweat form on my forehead.  My husband offered to trade his mild paneer makhani with my chicken Madras as he didn't see me \"suffer\".  Instead, I just tore into the parotta and scooped some rice with spoonfuls of the curry to help quell the spiciness.  I chose the chicken curry over the Chettinadu chicken curry option after reading more about Chettinadu curry being spicier.    $10.99  -Vegetable biryani:  this was a huge bowl of basmati rice cooked with biryani masala with tender cooked carrots, onions, potatoes, and cauliflower(?).  The rice was cooked to perfection as rice is the diet staple.  This biryani was very tasty, exotically and mild-medium spiced.   The flavors of curry leaves, coriander seeds, ground cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, and other indiscernible spices infused the rice.    A small side dish of raita (yogurt sauce) is served to cool down spiciness. $13.99  -Mango lassi:  this sweet yogurt drink flavored with mango was thinner than what I've had at other Indian restaurants but tasted like a glass of \"tropical sunshine\".  Each sip further cooled my palate from the spiciness in the curry and biryani as I got accustomed to the spice level.  $4.99  Oh, as usual, I do give a rating for service as it's an integral part of the experience... I subtracted a star because both female workers seemed sort of indifferent towards us.  When we asked about the difference between the chicken curry and Chettinadu chicken curry, the server told us that she couldn't explain the flavor differences...just that they're both curries.  Now, it would have been helpful if she could've just said that Chettinadu curry is spicier and made with coconut but instead, I had to look more deeply into the menu while googling it.  Also, when we inquired about the chef's background and what the highlights of South Indian cuisine were, the server just told us \" you have to ask the chef\".   Thankfully, the chef did come out of the kitchen periodically to chat with us.  The chef did explain that it's not usual to make South Indian dishes mild spice level as it would render them to be bland. He suggested that eating the accompanying bread, rice, or raita condiment to help tame the spiciness.  We enjoyed the flavors and would return for their more extensive dinner menu. We dmore so we'd probably return dinner menu as there seems to be more items to try.",

The food is very good and if you like Indian flavors, is a must go.  This new South Indian restaurant has taken over a former Japanese restaurant without renovating, but don't let that judge by the book's cover. It is what ends up inside your mouth and belly that makes it worth giving the place a chance.  I have yet to dine in, but did do takeout and the food was amazing.  The Chettinadu Chicken Curry was excellent and spiced perfectly.  It had enough kick to be noticed, but not to much to dominate all the other flavors.  Although Biryani is typically a Northern dish, the Vegetable Biryani was cooked perfectly and I think the best I have had here in Hawaii so far.  They have a smaller lunch menu over the dinner menu, so I look forward to returning to dine in next time for an evening meal. That being said, I do recommend giving this place a try.",

The uthappam and ravva dosa were undercooked. There was too much salt in the chicken 65. They are understaffed. I will give them credit for giving us the free ravva dosa.
