I ordered my food using the app around 7:20pm, and I will admit that they were very busy on this night. The app told me that my estimated pickup time would be around 7:45pm. 7:45pm came and went, and still no update on the app. There is a shelf where almost every other restaurant in Time Out Market places DoorDash orders for people to come pick up, and I have had good experiences using this pickup method from other vendors in Time Out Market. I went to go check on the shelf multiple times, and my order was never there. It was only at 8:05pm when I got fed up waiting and went up to the counter to see if they missed my order or something. When I asked, they promptly grabbed my food and gave it to me. This was exceedingly frustrating because the food that was given to me was a bag that had been sitting on a side counter, NOT under heat lamps, for over 20 minutes. My order WAS ready on time, but they did not update my DoorDash order, so I had no way of knowing that the food sitting on the counter was mine, and I did not know when to pick it up. After handing me my order (which was cold at this point... especially disappointing because it was a quesadilla), the staff THEN updated DoorDash, so on my end I got the notifications that my food was ready to pick up and that the order had been fulfilled simultaneously. I love this business, but I would not recommend anybody use DoorDash to order from them, and I would request that Taqueria El Barrio PLEASE educate your staff better on how to use DoorDash so that you actually notify people when their orders are ready to pick up.",

I called to get the issue fixed or a refund and was told the cashier didn't know how do a refund and to come the next day before she hung up on me.

I went during opening week and grabbed a fish taco and a vegan chorizo taco. The vegan chorizo is LIT\u2014spicy and packed with flavor. But, balancing that out, the fish taco was super dry and overcooked. I was able to overcome the dry fish by adding extra salsa\u2014there\u2019s a station after you order where you can load up more from mild to spicy.  As other local guides have commented, when this place opened you could get tacos for under $3 and it was a steal at that price. Now that the prices have gone up, it\u2019s  hard to get out of there for less than $10. If I\u2019m spending $10 on tacos, then I\u2019m going to zip on over to Lone Star instead.",

Also, what other reviewers are saying about the fish tacos being low quality is true, it's basically breaded fish-sticks.  If fish tacos is what you want then just down the street is Sunset Cantina, which has much better fish, made fresh, isn't breaded, costs the same, and the place has Taco Tuesdays (which this place does not).  Add to that the fact that their Asada steak has unchewable cartilage bits and is subpar in both quality and flavor when compared to Chipotle down the street.  This place is coasting on the good reviews on opening day, when the tacos were $2.75 and not $4, and plates were $8.50 and not $12.  Its not really a good deal on this food strip anymore.  I feel the only reasons to go here are the sauces, which are decent, and the El Pastor pork, and beef tongue, which aren't common, and this despite the El Pastor being atypically dry.  Everything else I've seen done both better and cheaper.",

I had a caramello (steak, refried beans, and cheese), a vegan chorizo, and a fish taco. My wife had two fish tacos. I thought the fish tacos we're good - not bad but not their specialty. The vegan chorizo was...vegan chorizo. Same as the supermarket. The caramello was exceptional!  A selection of salsas, none especially spicy. My favorite was the dried Chile puree. Chips were the one miss - baked instead of fried they were a little too hard.",

We ordered all the tacos on the menu and 2 Tortas CHORIZO. We were quite impressed by the Chorizo preparation (vegetarian option). My coworkers truly enjoyed El PAstor, Asada,Carnitas and Chicharon tacos.  I loved the decor, especially the traditional telavera tile on the tables.

My heritage, my California upbringing, my Hispanic family friends growing up, have all led me to a fascination, love, and appreciation of arguably Mexico's most emblematic dish, the beloved taco.  Which is why I had goosebumps walking into Taqueria el Barrio on its third day of operation, a new addition to Packard's Corner in Brighton. It's a start-up by the owner of well-known restaurants Bergamot (Sommerville) and Bisq (Cambridge) - neither of which has any Mexican showings. So I was, indeed, curious.  The line to wait was long, roughly 5 minutes. There was some confusion of wait staff and order takers as to who's orders were who's coming out of the open kitchen - notably because they do not take people's names at the time of paying at the register.  The dining area was clean. There are four (4) different salsas/sauces to be added to your dishes if you are so daring. For my palate, two were medium hot and two were spicy... but by New England standards, you would consider them to all fairly spicy. And for those that go too far with adding the heat, there's ice water available to go and guzzle down.  Go big or go home - I got four tacos: Asada, Carnitas, El Pastor (which is citrus-marinated carnitas), and Pollo. I consider these the \"four basic taco-food groups\" when trying new tacos.  By far, the Asada and Carnitas/El Pastor were the shining beacons. The Pollo was a bit too bland on my flavor meter... at least compared to the others on my plate. Guacamole for miles piled on my tacos! That was a surprise, and even more surprising - it almost overwhelmed my flavors. None had a notable marinate or sauce that made the tacos truly sing their highest possible notes. However, solid performances all around.  My friend got one asada torta (think a taco inside a bread bun), and that was loaded with the flavors I admittedly wished was packed into my tacos!  This place has the potential to become taco greatness. A few \"newbie\" kinks to work out, so I won't hold that against them until I update my review in a few months. They deserve your try. I'm betting most people will love them, and adore their decor, and enjoy their $3.25 taco prices, which for the size they come in, is a steal in Boston.",

I had an El Pastor Torta and Taco chicharr\u00f3n and el pollo. The portion was huge. The tacos were very juicy and flavorful! I also line the concept that you can eat as much sauces as you can and they all very authentic. I mean authentic (spicy  hot, not all of them). Wait till you try them! I wish this place good luck! They know what traditional Mexican food is about! 5+ star taco place!",

The churros are really great as well :)",
