Don't know why this place receive all of the bad raps from folks, must have been a different time I guess. But every time I order, the food is awesome (there is a difference between awesome and good, and this place definitely is the former). Their menu is extensive, and hence you can order things you usually can't get from other place, such as Udon and rice noodle (both of them are killer btw).  Also the restaurant itself is clean, modern-looking. I mean, I do not think there is much you can ask from a Chinese place. But this place did not miss the essentials (and offers something on the side). You will be happy in and out.",

He said he said it but 'I live down the street' as if the gives him the right to use an racist comment I truly think he needs to be a little more cautious of the comments he makes the people over the phone and in person being that African-Americans probably make up the majority of their business.",
