        "caption": "I work at the accounting office three blocks down and had their pizza for lunch today ago and it was absolutely disgusting. The sauce has so much acidity that it\u2019s even hard to chew. When I asked him if I can return the slices (mind you I only took two bites and I purchased two slices) he told me that if I didn\u2019t like it why did I bite it twice. All I asked was to exchange it for a sandwich or something. After waisting half my lunch hour arguing with the owner/chef he said he would give me credit only for one slice( how pitiful is that) and that\u2019s not even the worst part. I had to add money to get the BBQ wings which ended up being like rubber. They don\u2019t make them fresh the cook and reheat them ten times then slap some sauce and call it BBQ wings. Even A dog wouldn\u2019t those dry and burned wings. Stay away!!!",
