        "caption": "Found this place online and then had a bit of trouble finding the actual place.  It's basically setup in a corner of a bar.  I bought 2 slices, one pepperoni and one sausage.  The pepperoni crust was a bit more done and therefore more \"stiff\" on the bottom, but not over done so it was fine.  It was crunchy and if you held the pizza in one hand it was \"stiff\" enough not to bend.  Overall an okay slice.  The sausage was more \"flexible\" and if you held it by the crust in one hand, you'd probably have pizza in your lap.  I almost thought I had been given a cheese slice by accident but then noticed the small bits of sausage.  As far as the sauces goes - it's pretty non-existent.  extremely light no the sauce.  I prefer more sauce on my pizza.  Value wise, it's not a bad deal.  $5.90 for two slices and a can of pop ($6.50 after tax).  I haven't tried City Pizza yet and they are closer to where I work so I guess I'll give them a try and compare the two joints.",
