There was no line behind me, but I did have to repeat my order a number of times, and inquire whether the dining room in Ogilvie was open or not (it was).  The prices online are slightly cheaper than ordering in person, not sure why.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, something that's been talked about the past few months and... I don't see what the big deal is. It was served lukewarm and there was way too much breading for my comfort level, two or three bites worth of no actual chicken. The mayo was slobbered on. The pickles were distinct but ironically an unwelcome presence as they lacked the contrasting texture a Chick-Fil-A or Wendy's chicken sandwich would provide.  Fries were similarly lukewarm and hard. That's a bad thing, and the Popeyes-branded ketchup didn't do much to fix it.  With no sweet tea left, the Coke I was served (with completely melted ice) had come with a taped lid... why? Don't you think putting one's fingers on the center of all the lids to apply tape would cross contaminate with the food? Certainly defeats the purpose.  It was not a good experience, but hopefully it's not forever. Until they get their inventory and management systems in check, consider another Popeyes in the meantime.",

The first red flag I got was getting a ranch sauce with a hole in it but that\u2019s just the beginning of my misadventure.  I ordered the managers special \u201cchicken\u201d tenders and biscuit but only one of the tenders had real chicken in it.  They were also probably sitting there most of the day.   Some of the other tenders looked like they were made of some type of fake chicken or rib meat. Not much white meat at all. Needless to say i still ate them.  Right after eating them I knew I messed up and I started getting cramped up.  The next morning what followed for the next two days were some of the worst body aches and diarrhea I\u2019ve ever had in my life.   Felt like I got hit by a train and felt like I had disentary from not being able to control my bowels.  It was 100% the fake chicken I ate there!
