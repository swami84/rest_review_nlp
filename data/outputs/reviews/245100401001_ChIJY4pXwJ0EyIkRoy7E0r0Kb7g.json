Huge variety of food from chicken tenders to quesadillas to spinach pie to cheesesteaks to a great selection of salads. The salmon is just to die for. Love all of the staff, from the cooks and servers to the management and the owner himself!  Great set up. And they truly know and understand the meaning of fast yet excellent service. Their food absolutely never disappoints.  Been a faithful regular for almost 7 years and I seem to love it more and more with each year that passes!",

People go there on their lunch break. They have limited time so accuracy is key.  The organization of their workflow is horrible.   Everyone is running around and trying to get things done. They always look like they are behind. PICKLES...are not included on a hamburger nor do they advise you of the upcharge. HOWEVER... hots are included on a burger and there is no upcharge.    IF there is an upcharge for any items.. it is the servers obligation to tell the customer.  Wont be going back to this establishment anymore!! I can find a cheeseburger anywhere.",
