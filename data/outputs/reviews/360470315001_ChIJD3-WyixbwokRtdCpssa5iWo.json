Very filling, reasonably priced and warm & courteous service from the moment I walked in. And did I say it was made fresh while I waited??? Definitely going to be visiting again real soon to try some of their other meal options and the fruit infused juices, which seems to be a big hit. Don't hesitate to stop in and check out their menu and grab something to drink or eat... or both!",
