I really enjoyed my last course as well, as I was given a complementary dessert wine with the sorbet and those items paired together so well and were a great way to end the meal.  I also appreciated the staff consistently wearing masks and the other precautions taken; this was my first time eating inside a restaurant (as opposed to on patios/outside) and they made me feel safe with the precautions taken.  Overall, an incredible meal and an incredible dining experience, especially with how few I\u2019ve had since the pandemic started.  Thank you so much!  I will definitely be back!",

The highlight of the night were the agnolotti, and the vegetables that came with the salmerino and bistecca thag otherwise weren't as flavorful. The mozzarelle in carrozza and polpette were good too. So were the cannoli. The zabaione was very disappointing: average berries, with foam with little flavor.

The hostess promised us a 20 minute wait and we were not seated until after an hour had passed (and a manager had intervened). We had been sitting at the bar (where water/condensation drips on guests) and the poor manager realized that something was off and got us seated. The hostess was wearing a mask with a political statement on it - Totally inappropriate for a restaurant employee. I'd like to eat my Italian food without having the views of others shoved in my face. When we finally were seated, we were told that we had to order a 3 course meal for restaurant week. Although this was unexpected, we figured it was fine and at that point we were just happy to have gotten a table (albeit one in the back corner right by the kitchen). The first course was acceptable but the entrees were subpar at best - I ordered a simple spaghetti that came drenched in oil. I've never had a restaurant screw up something so simple. Our waiter was barely present and once again, the manager had to take care of us. The one star is for that young manager, who was the only competent person who deserves to be employed there. My boyfriend had gone to Officina several times before for business lunches so that was why we came this evening, but after tonight, neither of us would ever come back or recommend it. What an unpleasant experience all around.",

I had a Negroni at the main floor bar that was well crafted using my recipe (1 shot gin; 3/4 shot Compari and 1/8 shot sweet vermouth). Negroni was perfect but aloof, sullen service from the bartender. Cost of Negroni $16.00 plus $1.60 tax putting cost at $17.60 plus tip makes it more than a $20.00 drink. Keep in mind I asked for rail gin, nothing from the shelf.  Finishing the drink I learned the other 2 levels have bars and dinner reservation was for second floor seating. My second Negroni at second level bar was equally as good and identically costly. Two bartenders were affable and in good spirits though. My friends arrived and and we were seated for dinner. The center cut, bone-in, pork chop I ordered was terrific. Perfectly grilled and flavorful. Ciabatta bread was outstanding and shared calamari appetizer delicious. I enjoyed house selection of Chianti with dinner. Chianti at $16.00 glass like the Negroni, $17.60. Oh yeah, the great center cut, bone in chop was only $25.00 (I do not know plus tax cost. My friends paid dinner bill). So, I had $52.80 of drinks and $25.00 entree. My question is do I have a drinking problem or is Officina pricing out of line?",

I\u2018ve never been to a restaurant that isn\u2019t forthcoming with running someone\u2019s card incorrectly. The lack of acknowledgement about running the card wrong originally and the confirmation from the manager that he already knew the card was run incorrectly but didn\u2019t say anything seemed very shady. A week later I had to call back because the wrong charge went through on my card and the same manager told me it\u2019s because I left a $10 tip... on a $37 meal. I\u2019m generous but would never leave 30% on a check that was already messed up. Something very unprofessional and downright wrong is going on there. Beware giving them your credit card information.",

We alerted the waitress to the mistake, and she sent the manager over because she said that he was the one who had run my friend's card. The manager was incredibly rude, offered no apology, and acted annoyed that we had noticed the mistake. He ran my friend's card again with the correct amount, and she signed a second receipt. Obviously, the tip she left on this second receipt was lower because the corrected total was lower. My friend checked her bank account a few days later and saw that the tip she had left for the overcharged total had gone through, but the tip she left for the corrected total had not. She called the restaurant and got it fixed, but ultimately, this place left a bad taste in our mouths (pun intended). We definitely won't be coming back here.",

I was given a lesson in the different types of Amaro and was able to taste a lot of Amaro forward cocktails and had a flight!. The tiramisu is to die for and so is the bread that they give you for an aperitif. Will definitely go back. The only reason why I did not give it a full five stars. because I feel like if they have a tomorrow library it should be big enough to accommodate a private group and other people who want to partake as well.",

The burger and fries were of normal sizes. The flavors. I tasted each meal my family ordered. All of us agreed that everything was over salted. Salad, pasta, burger meat, and french fries had a lot of salt in it. \u00a0Also, the salad was sprinkled with something sour but did not feel like a real lemon.\u00a0 Overall, it was an OK experience but I don't think we would go there again.",

We arrived a bit early so had a seat at the bar area, the bartender seemed to not handle the stress of taking on an additional table of 4. We waited 30 minutes to get our drinks and didn\u2019t even get any water until after the drinks arrived. By this time it was 5:15 and we had to go back to the host stand to see if our table was ready. It was so I\u2019m not sure why we had to go follow up about our own table. By now we got to the main dinning room and the service was too slow. I\u2019m not sure if they had just opened or the floor team was just new, but they didn\u2019t seem confident at all. With it being New Years I was hoping for some high energy and involved service. Our server Walter was very nice. He made some great suggestions and walked us through the menu after getting his footing with the table. The food was EXCEPTIONAL. We ordered an additional calamari, it was that good. The kitchen was the only smooth running operation that evening, and for having an exposed kitchen, my hat\u2019s off to the chef and the kitchen team. Between courses we where reset with fresh silverware but had to asked to have the table wiped first. She set silverware on a messy table. We had several rounds of drinks and I spilled my espresso during desert and after cleaning up no one came over to take our dirty napkins, offer to bring a fresh espresso or even bring new napkins after I ordered a new espresso myself. Overall the service was spotty but the kitchen made up for it with the plates. I\u2019ll be back to try more dishes.",

Failing to inform the customer that it costs $55 and that it would the most expensive seafood dish on offer that night. All for up selling, all for using top fresh ingredients, but if an item is verbalized as a special, let the customer know the cost. Also, if you want to serve Rare lobster, make sure it is at least room temperature and not cold. My seared tuna was seared perfectly- on one side but left raw and unseared on the other. If that is your cooking style, serve the tuna seared side up, the visual would have been significantly improved. I thought the menu sounded great but unfortunately I possibly had a poorly executed meal. It was very busy so you must be doing the vast majority of what you do very well.",

(Note: if you like their weekday sandwiches, don't expect to get them on the weekend...I was abruptly told by our first server that those are weekday only items. Not sure who made that judgment call.) Decided, however, to have lunch there this past Sunday and boy was it a mistake. For the majority of our meal, our server literally ignored us. When he did stop by to take our order, he was rude and abrupt. While the restaurant replaced our server after benching him, and the manager came over to apologize and offer dessert, they never followed through on their offer. With two little kids ready for a nap, we decided not to bother waiting any further. What I really don't understand is a restaurant that has kids menus bringing kids drinks in glassware. Whoever thought that through...well, really didn't. In the end, though they tried to fix their missteps, and the new server was attentive and far better to the original, the managers overseeing the cafe space need some work.  Following up after owner's response - what does it mean when a restaurant says \"send us an e-mail if there's something we can do for you\"?",

Here's our experience:  Space: It's a huge, beautifully designed restaurant. The first floor has some seating, a bar, and a market selling fresh pasta, bread, and other Italian goods. The second floor has another bar and a large dining room. There's also outdoor seating on the balcony overlooking the Maine Avenue Fish Market, the oldest continuously operating fish market in the country.  Food: It's definitely quality Italian food. Warm, fresh bread comes to every table and you have the option of still or sparkling water. To start, we ordered the beet salad and burrata, both good (the beet salad has apples in it FYI). I ordered the scallops for my main and it was really delicious. Four large scallops in cream sauce come on a plate.  The only complaint is the service. Our server was not very friendly and very slow. If we needed anything, we had to flag him down several times before he brought it. He never brought us water when we needed it and he forgot to give us the check.

She ensure if I were to give them another chance she will ensure I get the service as it should be and also offered to cover my main course and desert. I went there again last month and had a good time. I like the drinks and appetizers here. It is kind of an expensive place but in the Wharf neighborhood it kind of the average. The entree's are expensive with respect to the flavors expecially the truffle risotto but I was ok with it since it was covered for me. I loved their take on deserts, I tried Baba au Rhum and it was delicious. I ended up paying for lots less than what I would had to but it was worth the experience for the location. The restaurant is very welcoming so woud return to it just for the hospitality and drinks.  Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Didn't like the service 1 bit. Had to wait 10 min for drinks on a night where only 3 tables were occupied. The server is also making drinks and is totally unaware of the menu and what they could offer. They are oblivious of their own kitchen closing time. I was waiting for 30 min for someone to take the dinner order, finally had to go and call someone to take our order for food and the guy says it's the last call for food since kitchen is about to close. Takes the order and 10 minutes later manager comes back and says \"The kitchen is closed, we cant serve you anything. But please do comeback and we promise to take better care.\" WTH! Why would I thinking of coming back after such a pathetic service and quality of drinks. Just because these guys are on Wharf, the price isn't justified nethier by the quality of drinks or the service they offer. DC has lot of other better Italian places to try.",

He also selected 4 desserts to finish things off.  We ate family style and it was excellent!  I am so glad we had lots of meats and pasta and even 2 fish options.  I would save that the two fish dishes were not great, but the beef porterhouse and ribeye were excellent. Give this place a try!",

Nobody came by to ask if she was ok - which I can live with.  But then when we asked the manager about ingredients, he expressed no concern over our 5 year old daughter, pale and dizzy in her seat.  Never offered to replace her food, never tried to get to the bottom of what may have caused, maybe allergy, maybe bad food.  Nobody offered any assistance, so we got our check, paid and left. As I carried my daughter in her ill, limp body, we saw that manager again. Didn't say a word to ask how she was, whether there was anything we needed - water or a bag to be sick in.  I'm not sure this is service, but I am sure that I will never come back to eat here.  One of the reasons why we pay to eat out is to feel like a valued customer.  Instead we felt like an ATM that just paid money for food.  If you want to pay $100 to feel like nobody, go to Officina.",

My friend and I both ordered burgers at the bar and after waiting noticed that an order was brought to the bar but not passed out. After 15 minutes of looking at said order, we inquired about whether or not it was one of ours. The bartender told us that he didn't know which of ours it was (we ordered the same thing on different tabs). After figuring out it was not my order, I asked another bartender about an ETA. She kindly noted that my burger was taking 20 minutes longer because it was medium well and not medium. After asking for a manager I was then told by said manager that my food was one minute away from coming out. She did offer a refund to offset the wait...thanks, but where's my food? 20 minutes after the one minute she promised, after being dodged by her and watching her serve other patrons meals, the bartender brings my order. How unclassy and professional. The food nor the drinks are worth the wait or the hassel of back-handed, mediocre service. No thanks ever again.",

You can\u2019t remove or substitute anything. Tried to order gnocchi with tomato sauce instead of a butter sauce. They said no. Tried to order a different dish and remove an ingredient. They said no. Tried to order pizza for my young daughter. They said no. Said I had to go to a different floor of the restaurant to order that. Also, not vegetarian friendly and menu has many items that are probably unfamiliar to most people. We all had to google most menu items to try to understand what they were. Service was sooo slow. We waited an hour and a half before we received our dinners. Given their high prices, food was not great.  Finally, pics of this restaurant online looked beautiful and upscale, but not in person. Had drinks on the rooftop and dinner in the restaurant. Didn\u2019t appear clean and had the feel of a cruise ship. Sat beside a pile of propane tanks and rusty weights. Definitely don\u2019t recommend this restaurant.",

I have ordered the Bucatini before and it is definitely my favorite dish here, and it's hand-made fresh! The Aperol Spritz is my favorite drink here also.  Please visit the roof-top level.  They make amazing flatbreads as well as other dishes to munch on while enjoying the view and whatever drinks you'd like at their rooftop bar!

        "caption": "After an incredible experience at Masseria almost 2 years ago, we've been wanting to try Nicholas Stefanelli's Officina for quite some time and finally found ourselves an occasion this weekend. The Trattoria is well appointed with an open kitchen, airy feel, lots of wood, marble tables, and a nice strip of outdoor seating. We were very shocked that at noon on a beautiful Saturday, the indoor section of the restaurant only had 3 tables including ourselves - it was almost eery how empty it was. After eating, we could see why. We ordered a choice of 7 salumis and formaggios to start. Other than the Nduja, the rest of the salumis were pretty underwhelming - the mortadella was the blandest we've ever had, the prosciutto di parma was excessively chewy. We also ordered several antipasti to share - fried anchovies, bombetta pugliese, and trippa parmagiano. The first two were pretty good. The trippa was not good - it was pretty bland and lacked an \"oomph\". We tried 3 pastas and a pesce for our mains: bucatini, spaghetti nero, maltagliati, and the gamberoni/prawns. The pastas all lacked flavor - there was nothing that cut through and really wowed us in the flavor. The prawns were extremely disappointing - they were more like oversized shrimp and a bit overcooked. The squid ink pasta's texture was also weird - it felt more like soba noodles. In addition to all this, our server (Ivan?) tried to upsell everything. He advised us 3x to try the Moliterno al Tartufo cheese, which is a +$3 charge. His \"favorite\" pasta also happened to be the most expensive on the menu. He also tried to sell us burrata to dip with our complimentary bread...even though we already ordered a cheese board. It was suffocating. Yet, through all this, he never once bothered to come over and refill our water glasses. He refilled our water canteen, but never our cups. Overall it was a very disappointing overpriced experience after the delicious food we had at Masseria. We certainly didn't expect Michelin-level, but we expected more - no wonder the restaurant is empty.",

And, I will say, that the food was delicious (the portions are small, so adjust your expectations accordingly). The issue was the service. I was there with a small group (6 people - not unmanageable) and our service was beyond slow and not particularly friendly. For example: one of the dinner entrees was forgotten all together and when asked about the status of it, our waiter had a flippant response and no apology. Glasses of wine took 15+ min to arrive at our table. Etc. Start to finish, this was not a great experience - the delicious food was not enough to overcome the terrible service.",
