I placed an order for a chicken teriyaki sub which tasted anything but. There was so much mayo on the sandwich that it was practically soaking.  My biggest concern is the fact that the spices and sauces that are located at the end of the line, is also being used by the guy who is prepping my food. I noticed that earlier a construction guy grabbed the sirracha bottle with his hand (probably not washed) and then the same guy in the kitchen grabbed the bottle with gloves on to drizzle the sauce on the sandwich he was prepping. Why don\u2019t they have their own bottle. This was disgusting and a health risk.  Will not be returning!",
