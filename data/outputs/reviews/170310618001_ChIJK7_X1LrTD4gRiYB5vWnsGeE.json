Waited 30 mins (the restaurant was now closed) and contacted Slice to try and see what was going on. Their customer service called and no answer. I called and no answer. It was now two hours since I placed the order and there was no food or even an update from the restaurant. Thankfully, Slice canceled the order for me and refunded me, but this was just insane. Horrible experience, especially when it was late and I was starving. Won\u2019t be ordering from here again I\u2019ll tell you that.",

The one thing they did well was the toppings were generous but again so seasoning at all.  You are better off going anywhere else or just pickup a frozen pizza.",

The pizza was great, especially if your only wanting to spend 5 bucks you get a slice as big as your head with a drink for a total of $5.50.  Now not only was the pizza delicious but the all you can drink craft soda was delish, I guzzled down the Dr. Pie.  All in all, great place to go after a few drinks or for a quick bite. As much as I love Homerun Inn or Giardons I don't always want to drop 40 bucks on pizza. I will definatly be returning with my friends when I'm back in Chicago.",

Awful service. I receive my pizza to find it has been topped with green olives rather than the green peppers that I ordered. I'm a chill guy, no big deal, I'll just call to see what we can do.  I call to be greeted by the rude order taker who took my order in the first place. After explaining the topping mishap he proceeds to accuse me of saying \"green olives\" rather than apologize for a possible misunderstanding. First, I hate olives and would never utter the word in my life. Secondly, this is coming from the same order taker who 100% botched the name Tyler on my receipt and failed to add the \"well done\" I requested as well... so I wonder who was in the wrong. Seems to me he just wasn't listening.  Regardless who said what... treat your customers like you want them to come back. Got this place recommended by a friend and will be sure to pass along to never go here to everyone I encounter that enjoys pizza.  What a shame.",

Not only is the pizza great but he goes out of his way to provide absolute top level customer service to the point of bringing the pizza to me when I was sitting down, to extra fixings, and polite conversation. All while running literally every aspect of the business by himself: cooking and making the pizza's, taking phone calls, processing orders, dealing with the other customers. Wow is all I can say. I want to see this guy succeed so bad that I urge everyone to give his pizza a try and support local Entrepreneurs. Its been a while since I have seen anyone as deserving as him.
