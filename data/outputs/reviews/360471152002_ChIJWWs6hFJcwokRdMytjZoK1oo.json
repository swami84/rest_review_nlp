Depending on if the female manager is there these issues tend not to happen. Also if I order pizza it should be hot and not cold. Will order from Papa John's from now on.

I had money to tip him but seeing how I had to stand up and sign my receipt while trying to balance food I just felt like he wasnt deserving of my tip. The food it self was horrible. I ordered hot wings, cheesy bread and 2 pizzas. The pizza was dry and the crust was so thin and hard. The cheesy bread taste like the skimmed the cheese bc they didn't have enough or was trying to save on products. But the hot wings was great. But I dont think I will order from here for a while.",

All the toppings were literally sliding off the pizza!!!  When I held the pizza everything just slide off and I'm left holding a limb slice! It was horrible. I called the store and they advised I return the box of pizza. Meanwhile I do not live walking distance!! I asked if a driver can pick it up when they're in the area and she rudely replied NO! I'm all about customer service but she was not trying to consider any options to fix her store's mistake. Now I'm left here hungry with a box of pastey-cheesy toppings!",

The drivers arrived at the house and shouted out of his car window. I couldn't make out what he was saying so I decided to go to the vehicle and was informed that they no longer deliver to your door and its curb side only. I checked the pizza and it was cold. I informed the driver who then called the store and he was told that he should return the pizza to the store. No knowing what that meant, I sent everything back. I called the store and asked to speak to the manager, and the employee who answered the phone refused to give me his name or connect me with the manager and placed me on hold forever. I called back from another line and spoke to the manger, Denzel who promised to remake my order and deliver it to my house within 15 minutes. My food never arrived. I called the store to reverse the charges the next day! Unacceptable!!!",

After 1 hour i called dominos store creating the order and was placed onhold for 30 minutes. When i finally got the employee on the phone i was told that they are running late and that my order is being prepared. After waiting 2 hours since placing the order i contacted the store again and being onhold for 45 minutes i was told that the delivery driver just got back and my order is leaving the store now. It is now 4 and 30 minutes since i placed my order and delivery has not been made. When i tried calling the store i get put onhold and was unable to speak to anyone after being onhold for over an hour. At this point im disputing the charge with my credit card company.  THIS IS BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE!!! I WILL MAKE SURE NOT TO EVER ORDER FROM DOMINOS AGAIN.",
