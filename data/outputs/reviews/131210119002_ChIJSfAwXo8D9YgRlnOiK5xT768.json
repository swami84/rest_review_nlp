These always seem to come in at the middle of the lunch rush and are somehow given priority over the people in line - or that's the appearance of what happens, I could be mistaken. But even that wouldn't be the issue except somehow my order always gets messed up when I'm there for one of these. Not inedibly messed up, just...I end up with the wrong meat, or an ingredient I asked not to have. By the time I'm aware of this, I'm back at my office, and I'm not going to walk back down to point out the issue.  Now, is this going to stop me from going there?  No, probably not - again, it's not inedible mistakes, just irritating ones.",

Each team member was completing a task as they helped the small stream of customers. The next time I am in the Ga State area I will again frequent this location as I was overall pleased with my experience. Keep up the great work Willys staff :-)",

This should be a given but it is not.  I was so impressed I gave the manager Ms. Vanessa the compliment and I also went over and gave the girls who were cleaning the same compliment, many times you hear all the complaints of the things you are not doing right or could have done better but today was a good day for the team at 100 Piedmont.  I have not walked into a fast casual Mexican restaurant and not seen a salsa bar that did not have salsa on the bar.  This place was damned near spotless - which means their doing something right - having the LARGE population of clients they deal with from GA State, all the Capital and City employees down the block and all the additional take-out and walk in clients to be this busy and still have time to clean and keep a remarkable staff is an achievement.  Kudos to you Ms. Vanessa and the team at 100 Piedmont, keep up the good work!!!!!!!!   : )",

The guy was so rude even when i told him it was my first time. He automatically put shredded cheese on my nachos even though i didnt want shredded cheese. I know at Moes they always ask you. Next the short Hispanic lady was SO rude. One, i could not understand her she spoke so fast so i said \"im sorry what ?\" And she got mad and was just rude. I was scared to ask for anything. I quickly just told her lettuce and cucumbers because i was scared to ask for other stuff. She just threw lettuce and cucumbers on my plate like a mean lunch lady. I could tell she hates her job. She was horrible. The cashier didn't even ask if i wanted a drink . i told her can we add a drink please. To get my drink, the sweet tea was so sweet. It tasted like SYRUP! ugh. And then THE WHOLE SODA MACHINE WAS FLAT! the coke, sprite everything came out flat. So i paid for a drink but got water. Next i couldn't even finish my food it was terrible. I woke up the next day with my stomach all tore up. I will never go back to this place. At least at moes i feel welcomed and their food is so much better and i have never been sick after eating at moes. Like I said this was my first experience but my last. They need to do something at least about the people working there. They are horrible.",
