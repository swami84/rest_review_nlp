The minute chicken and walnut shrimp were pretty good too. Service is not the best because the two times we were there, there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant, which was full to the gills. BTW, this was lunch, so I'm not sure about dinner service. I want to go back again...when time isn't an issue.",

Recommended by Steamed Fish Filet, the store's signature. The first piece of the picture is that, but I ask each time. After that, we recommend fried noodles, and if you like chopsticks, we recommend Roast Duck. If you can afford the money, Beijing Duck is good. Basically I would not ask for something I like and let go of it. I've been out of order for something I don't know.  It is also attractive to put in mostly without a reservation because the store is large. The parking lot is a neckline, but there aren't many.  One of the recommended local stores! !

We recently spent a week in Honolulu and what we ate at Mini Garden was THE BEST meal we had the entire trip (and we ate at Morimoto and Stage). This is not the super Americanized \"Chinese\" food that must mainlanders are used to, but it's not intimidating either. Anyone can find something they like here. The ginger fish and char su pork were AMAZING! We loved the salt and pepper tofu and the duck too. Go with a big group and eat family style so you can try everything.",
