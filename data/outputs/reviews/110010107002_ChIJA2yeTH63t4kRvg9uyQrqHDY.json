It's been under construction for a while but it seems that the wait was worth it -- The interior is clean, the staff are very friendly, and most important, of course: The food is good! My colleagues and I tried a variety of dishes (mostly the chicken) and all of the meals and sides got very positive reviews. The fried plantains were my favorite thing.  An initial reaction among friends is that the menu is trying to do a lot at once -- grilled chicken, kebabs, ceviche, and burgers, all under one roof. We will see how it works out!  All in all, a very exciting addition to Connecticut Avenue and a must-try if you're interested. Best wishes to the Super Pollo staff as they boot up on a very busy street.",
