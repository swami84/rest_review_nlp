I said the menu says $9.75.  I asked asked what are the extra charges because it says that delivery is free.  She said we charge 10 percent taxes.  I said that's more than 10%.  She got quiet.  I asked her again and she said that fried rice is an extra two dollars.  I said it doesn't say that on your menu.  I asked about the charges again and she said \"you can order here or somewhere else.\"  I said thank you and hung up.  Will never ever call to place an order with them again.

She told me that they were using the Eddie's menu, as there are two carryouts ran out of the same place. I had an Eddie's menu from last week that was left in my door, and I told the lady that the item was still on the menu, asked her if they still sold it or not. She then tells me after being very rude and nasty that she spent to much time with me on the phone, when she was the one who put me on hold while she yelled at another customer over the phone. I hung up on her, and I refuse to support a business that would allow someone to talk to their customers in such a nasty manner.",
