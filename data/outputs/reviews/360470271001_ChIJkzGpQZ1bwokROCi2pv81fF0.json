The shrimp pasta is literally alfredo sauce from a jar with shrimp and seasoning but it was really good surprisingly! Well seasoned! It was also very creamy. like it had ALOT of sauce in it. The sauce pooled at the bottom of my plate which was a bit much but I still enjoyed it. The codfish cakes were spicy which I personally didn\u2019t like and the inside was kind of like a crabcake but it was pretty good. I\u2019ve had a lot of pi\u00f1a coladas and Swiingz\u2019s pi\u00f1a colada is near the top of my list. One of the best pi\u00f1a coladas i\u2019ve ever had. The fried rice tasted weird at first because it tasted like it had soy sauce in it was it was still really good. they put an adequate amount of shrimp in the pasta and the shrimp in the fried rice was cut up. The portions were really big too. I would definitely visit were again!",

This place is close to work so we like to go on Fridays after work- so I would say we were regulars ( pre and post quarantine). The first incident our server messed up our whole order, wrong appetizers, wrong drinks , wrong food and we didn\u2019t complain we kept everything he brung. He was very apologetic and appreciative that we didn\u2019t complain and offered us a round of drinks. Only for the manager to come and explain that they couldn\u2019t do that . Why I\u2019m not to sure. Although a little hesitant we ended up going back to have ANOTHER incident with management. We came ordered a round of drinks later dinner and when another friend joined us, he ordered dinner. We closed our tab moved to another area and continued to order when the manager came over and asked us to leave because we had been there too long. As much as I like this place and I lovvvee to support ppl of color I am a paying customer and I refuse to consistently disrespected by management. In the current climate of the restaurant business you would think that restaurants appreciate loyal customer SWIINGZ does not.",

When I asked how much it was virgin the waiter didn't seem to know and even said $13 at one point (really?!? A virgin is more than a regular?!? Made no sense.) so I told him to just forget it and bring me a lemonade. The lemonade was basically lemon concentrate with sugar. I got a fruit punch instead and it was redeemable. Fried shrimp appetizer was delicious.  The main course food though...\ud83d\ude12 it was disappointing. Not fresh. It felt like frozen pre-cut items they threw together.. It wasn't good. I don't expect a restaurant to give me food I can make at home from my frozen food section and even then I probably could have made it better. Try to avoid entree meals involving chicken unless you like paying to much for subpar food.  Vibe was chill. 3 stars. 1st star for the vibe/music/swing 2nd star for fruit punch 3rd for the appetizer",

When he did--he took the drink order and then left us for what felt like an hour at least. After finally flagging another server down we were able to place our food order. I had the Shrimp pasta and my friend had the salmon burger. We ordered the codfish cakes as an app. After taking forever my PASTA finally came out BEFORE the app. The bartender does a halfassed apology saying they made the pasta first...and the app and my friend's food should be out shortly.  20mins later and halfway through my food I had to ask him where was everything else. He then goes and gets it. Not sure if this is the norm or maybe the exception because there were the three big parties....either way the service and food were horrible....I def won't be going back....there was a family in there arguing to get the included gratuity off of their check because they had the same exact sentiments. It's sad because we try and support the neighborhood and buy Black but this is the service we get. Yes--I can afford it but it's still my hard earned money being spent on mediocre service and food.  We really have to do better!! The two stars are only because it's Black owned.",

I wanted bammy, but they were out. Smh, why? Bammy should never run out. If that's on your menu... then stock up properly. Next, out of the entire empty restaurant, at night... they sat a family of a dad and two kids next to my husband and I. Really? So no quiet romantic time for us anymore. Then the family proceed to play loud music on their phone trying to do a tic tok video. Which meant they did it over and over again to get it right. Mind you, the restaurant already plays music (which isnt bad)... but ruined. Asked family and then server to ask about lowering their music... it was eventually turned fown/off after 10m or so. I shouldn't have to ask the server to do this. But anyway... food and drink were on par. Pineapple lobster was different, a tad sweet, but nice enough. Good luck! Oh... and for some reason, there was music thumping from the basement? I dont know what was underneath the restaurant, but it sounded like a club. Weirdish experience. May go back, but in no rush.",

Several of their employees had assured me that everything I had been planning was going to be put into action. Time after time I would go in to check up I was referred to a different staff member. Everytime I went they all assured me I had the greenlight and that I would getting a confirmation call the next day. Repeatedly I never got called back. Well after one month of never hearing from them for a follow up I finally went back last night. The hostess was very kind and attentive. She spoke to the owner from his car last night. While I waited I finally felt a sense of relief that I could confirm for my birthday.  I was told last night that I would get a confirmation by noon today with all the details. Noon came an went and finally I was the one who had to reach back and call their establishment. To my disappointment I dealt with a very rude Manager, he stated that I could not host my birthday party there after all. He did not believe me that I had spoken with their staff while the owner was present, **(mind you I was never introduced to the owner, he stayed in his car the entire time while the kind hostes spoke to him through his car window)The next day when I called, the manager basically interogated me over the phone and demanded that I provided him with the owner's name to prove that I had some form of communication with him . I told him \"I never knew his name, we were never introduced\". I am now less than a month away from my birthday  and I am left scrambling for a new location....this is so disappointing. I wanted to give their new establishement a lot of business . But After my poor experience with the staff and manager sadly I will never be coming here.** In response to management/owner: I was definitely not mistaken (it wasn't a feeling just stating the facts from my poor experience in dealing with management.) what we had agreed on was based on the information provided by their staff. I was misled and misinformed. Definitely NOT MISTAKEN. Not once was I ever told it needed to be a dinner party, not once did I make any mention of a DJ. Just simply the possibility of a spotify list at some point in the evening. Also, I was told by the kind hostess that yes, they had recently hosted a birthday party, and that it would be no problem (inspite of my large guest list, she said it would be no problem last night when we spoke) Again I was missinformed. They never specified that it HAD to be a prefixed dinner menu to have my celebration there. Also, in regards to decorations, I was told balloons were ok to bring in.  So again, not mistaken, just misinformed.** Update, oh yeah after this whole ordeal they decided to call me to confirm my party....a couple of days before my would have been party and they told me I could not host there...SMH.....",

We saw the outside and said\u2014are we sure?  But like a dream, we walked in and thought we had landed in an upscale, well-to-do,  bougie  Restaurant.  What we landed into was the best dang on restaurant, i have had the pleasure of dining in.  The     Ambience  Was excellent, our waitress, Ms Satin, was great and the food was, in an old school way of saying it\u2014off the chain!  I saw where this restaurant had a 4.4 rating\u2014i want to know who in the hell was the .6 that didn\u2019t give this restaurant 5 stars.  If you are visiting like me and my wife is doing, or live anywhere in NY\u2014visit Swiingz\u2019s\u2014your stomach will always praise your choice.",
