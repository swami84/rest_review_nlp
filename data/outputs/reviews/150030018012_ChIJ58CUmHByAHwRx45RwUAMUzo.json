The peasant in the front as we approached was the first experience off the plane as we approached her stand she proceded to say 21 and over bye. Without a word coming out of our mouths without asking my name or carding me. I am however flattered that this neanderthal thought I was under 21, that must rub her the wrong way. Had she done her job I could have provided I dont know both my drivers license and military ID card that says I am 34 and my husband is 37. Perhaps my supple,smooth caramel skin bothers her.  I hope she can have someone read her this review and perhaps reflect.",

Once you get there, they inform you that per state regulations,  30% of your check must be food. Which I understand isn't under their control but anyway its very inconvenient for me as a costumer. I ate before getting there at 7:30, so I'm not hungry to eat a lot maybe an entree but no more than that. I was going there to drink. Again it's the city, no the bar decision but everyone should know that. The music is ridiculous. It sounds like a little radio, you can hear everyone conversations,  even the people's seating far from you. They gave me the table all the way back by the bathroom. No open air like other tables. Which is nice. Only a fan over there and smelling to urine all night, because bathroom vent is right on your head. We stay there for only 30 minutes, after that I was ready to go. My hotel room is way better than being there paying to drink with no music and 30% of your money going to nowhere, because the nachos that i order, was left everything there. So. After this,  if you ready to go, you good.  But if want to have fun and spend your money in a smart way and spend on with real fun, that's not the place. I'll check this reviews remains up and isn't deleted by anyone. Thanks.",

It is really COVID-19 safe- they do a temperature check and gently remind you in case you forget to put your mask back on if you leave your table (there very friendly about it!)

Perhaps the nonchalant and matter-of-fact treatment of the customer had already existed prior to the COVID pandemic, but it has seemed to have exploded mid-crisis. Apart from that brief moment that I placed my order while seated at the bar, I had no further human interaction with any waiter or bartender, except when my bartender/ waiter dropped by an hour after I had ordered & eaten in front of my barside stool to ask  \"are you doing Ok?\". the only true human interaction was with fellow customers that I noticed were enthusiastically sharing comments on their day's batch of photographs. But when she stood and came close enough to hand me her camera, the waiter intervened physically and insisted that car need to maintain the proper social distance. It is completely understandable WHY the waiter was so \u2018protective\u2019 of the customers taking \u2018so-called\u2019 risks with our personal social distancing. Because, if the restaurant is closed, he\u2019d lose his source of income. But finesse and common sense are also needed in order to not make dining at Hula\u2019s a mundane boring chore. For that, I coir more readily and possibly more enjoyably just stay at home.  Despite my rather negative review of the untypically mundane customer service, the truth is that the entrees are very tasty, showing originality, and a certain panache that is totally the baliwig of the chef (or cook) and has little to do with the professional customer service or lack thereof.",

        "caption": "Hula\u2019s Bar & Lei Stand has had a long history as one of the more convivial and \u2018friendly\u2019 night spots In Waikiki. It\u2019s been serving great cocktails and drinks, as well as more recently a delightful and delicious pupus (comestibles) for decades (maybe since the 70s or even earlier). But what makes it truly gratifying nowadays is the way that a diverse panorama of men and women ( aged 21-99), who may be gay or straight (actually LGBTQ), a MultiEthnic rainbow in skin colors, multicultural in ethnic origin, and regardless of socioeconomic level or religious persuasion, can all enjoy a night spent in this special drinking establishment.  Hula\u2019s is just around the corner from the main street, Kal\u0101kaua Ave, that runs through the heart of Waikiki and also a two-step distance from Lemon Road, where three hostels are located and why I found this second floor bar with a balcony facing Waikiki Zoo. Leaving the hostel to find a place to eat and drink, I discovered a small crowd of people visible above me at the Waiki Grand Hotel on Kapahulu Ave and made my way upstairs to 2nd floor Hula\u2019s Bar. It looked like a fun place to chat with the  locals and with my fellow American and international tourists ---  and Surprise, Surprise, Surprise (as Goober on the Andy Griffith Show just to say),  it turned out to be that AND much more. Read below to find out what and why.  About the bars, drinks and food selection.... There are the tried-and-true draft beers, cocktails, and wine selections, of course. I choose the mango margarita, and happily was recommended to make it a pitcher. Being more than enough to share, I rapidly made friends with those I was sitting with at the bar. The surprise about Hula\u2019s is that don\u2019t actually sell leis anymore, but it does have a fairly complete food menu. I selected two quesadilla items:  the braised duck and goat cheese, and also another quesadilla made from Kailua pork, so that I could share with my newly-made bar mates.  I understand from reports of the people who come here often (whom I met that night in early January 2020) that the clientele changes throughout the week and even is more varied depending on the time of day, and night\u2014 which is totally normal. While I was there, a \u2018boatload\u2019 of customers, literally, arrived around 5 pm as they had just returned from a 90-minute catamaran cruise off Waikiki Beach, sponsored weekly by Hula\u2019s.  Evidently, there are different events held during the week, but I don't suppose their is an amateur drag show night like the ones my college dorm mates and friends used to put on during the early 70's.  While the bar clientele are generally middle-aged men, mostly gay men or gay couples but plenty of straights, the type of clientele who patronize the bar completely changes during the course of an afternoon into early evening, which is what I observed when I was there. As darkness approached, there were suddenly more trendy and fashion-conscious male-female couples, and also younger mixed groups.  Update:. December 22, 2020  During the COVID lockdown in Honolulu, they only way to enjoy Hula's was to arrive with a pre-booked reservation and to eat and drink only with your table partners, thus making the experience pretty boring since you are essentially locked out of any human interaction when you eat by yourself, as was my situation at Hula's Bar and Grill this evening. The food and pitcher of Margaritas were great, but even the typically very friendly, almost flirtatious wait staff were definitely not as attentive as they normally are. They were definitely not working (very hard) for tips. This I have downgraded my review overall experience to a 4. Perhaps the next will again be an improved customer service and rapport that will earn Hula\u2019s the 5 rating it deserves.",

Lee of course is gorgeous and very much a part of what makes the bar so special to us.  It's a unique gay bar which of course is changing with the times but oh so special to hawaii.
