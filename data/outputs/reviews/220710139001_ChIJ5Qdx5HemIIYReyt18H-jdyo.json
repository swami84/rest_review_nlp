The fact that the staff sat back and watched as a couple pointed and laughed at her till she was in tears and said nothing.

To the point where it completely kills the taste of the ingredients and you just want to wash it down with generous amounts of that $50 Chard are move on. There's nothing wrong with some salt, particularly when it comes to seafood, but you need at least something to balance the saltiness, and this was well off balance on both counts.  The baked oysters were fine, but they were chopped and baked to the point where almost anything would taste good if you put some creole spice on it. Solid appetizer, but not a culinary highlight.  Surely we could've just sent back whatever we didn't like, and ultimately get a very nice meal, but there are certain expectations of consistency that come with higher price tags, and these weren't met this time.",

She says its probably the best fillet she has ever had and it did have better flavor the my rib eye. First off I have never had lyonaise potatoes that were basically potato chips. I have always had them served almost like American fries but thinner. Unfortunately these were like eating stale, cold chips. My main issue was that my steak tasted like a salt lick. It was over salted towards the middle- but oh well maybe it was just me. The BBQ jumbo shrimp was out of this world and the service was certainly second to none. I have had dry aged steaks at some of the most prestigious restaurants and it was just a shame that I had to keep drinking water to finish it. I would definitely go again but I would have a different order. Honestly the service and wonderful flavors of the rest of the food saved this from being a 2 star review.",

They put us in a table that was actually too big for our party - I felt like it was difficult to talk to the people at the table as we were so far apart.  Then, I felt somewhat rushed to order - which was so ironic because it took FOREVER - to get our main course.  Our reservation was at 7 - our food did not arrive until 9!!  2 hours?  When we complained - they looked at us like we were unreasonable and provided lame excuses while we watched other people come, eat  and go. Two people had steak, 3 had fish and one had a bowl of gumbo.  They also forgot some things we ordered and some items were actually cold.  As a way to say sorry - they sent out some lemoncello (? Not sure of the spelling) which was lame as we had two non drinkers at the table.  Hard to say if the food was actually good because the experience was pretty darn awful.  $500 down the drain.  Expected to pay that but didn\u2019t expect the experience to be so BAD.  Overrated.",

We didn't sit at the regular table, but decided to sit at the bar and enjoy their wonderful $.99 chargrilled oysters & half priced cocktails during happy hour to start.  Many of the other places that do chargrilled oysters usually grill it so much the oysters are all shriveled up and you barely get to taste them, but not here at Delmonico's. The oysters were perfectly grilled and seasoned.  The bartenders also know how to make some great cocktails here.  After eating a dozen oysters and some snacks, we ended up splitting the Kansas City strip steak, and it was delicious.  It's one of the best steaks I've had in a while - perfectly cooked and seasoned to medium rare. They also bring you a bevy of sauces for the steak, but there's no need. It's perfect as is.  Because we sat in the bar area, I thought the service wouldn't be as good as if we had sat at the tables, but I was wrong.  The service was very attentive, friendly, and fast even though it was pretty busy.  Another one of Emeril's establishment that doesn't disappoint. We'll definitely be back.",

While eating at Merils one of our favorite restaurants in the city the manager Jeremy recommended we go to Delmonico's and told us about all of the other dishes in addition to to steak  that they.  Our first visit was with close friends and we had two different fish dishes which were fantastic. The almondine fish preparation is by far the top prepared almondine in the city.  In the same week we were delighted to go back with a group of about 8 people from out of town.  Several friends ordered different types of steaks and indicated they were the best steaks they had had in the city and possibly the country! I tried the duck breast with the Madeira sauce which is also a top dish.  On both visits we had a variety of cocktails which were superb as well as extensive wine selections.  Be sure sometime during your meal to ask for one or two of the housemaid liquors.  The service is top-notch and the staff is extremely friendly and a joy to dine with.  As locals we eat out several times a week and now Delmonico's is a place we will frequent together as well as with our family.  Wethet you are local or an  out-of-towner Delmonico's is a must meal!",

My Cajun companion and I both loved everything about Delmonico - even with him being a very tough critic when it comes to local cuisine!

It was very fatty (not rendered, white fat) and tough.  I ordered the pork chop.  It was pretty dry.  The string beans were good.  My husband ordered the lobster pasta.  The pasta and gravy were good.  The lobster tail was overcooked and chewy.   We ordered the mac and cheese, dirty rice and lyoinnaise potatoe sides.  Mac and cheese sauce had separated and was very oily.  The potatoes were dry and like semi soggy potato chips.  The dirty rice was ok but, as others have said, very salty.  All in all, we won't return and cannot reccomend to others.",

They were delicious. The entries we ordered are:  \u2022Nuts crusted flounder with artichoke & couscous and some very creamy rich flavor of green sauce. This is on special menu, waiter strong suggested it. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t enjoy this dish. The flounder is dry and flaky, the artichoke\u2019s flavor is just not the right fit to this dish and the creamy green sauce is too creamy rich. This dish make us felt uncomfortably full.  \u2022 Paneerd pork chop. I wasn\u2019t expecting that this is a breaded pork chop. I expected a nicely piece of grilled or pan fried meat, so I was very disappointed when it came breaded. However, the meat is very tender. I also don\u2019t enjoy the dirty rice that came with the dish - I did not enjoy the character in it.  \u2022 lamb chop. The meat is big and thick and came with creamy quiche. We prefer smaller and more tender lamb chop. Again, this is a heavy dish.  Our conclusion is the starters are delicious, but the entries are very American style - big and rich but not having sophisticated flavor.",

The entrees were the 21 day aged rib eye and collard greens. The steak was cook a perfect medium well and the greens tasted as though they were slow cooked all day with hammocks. The lobster I'berville was delicious and the lobster and pasta texture was perfect. One thing I would say is the sauce with the pasta was a little too buttery. The lemon thyme cheesecake is yum!!

We explained the issue to the waiter and he took it away immediately, but was returned within seconds and clearly just had ice added and was still weak compared to the other drink.  So not a good start.   We ordered a shrimp appetizer and the sauce tasted scorched so it was not eaten.  Next, we ordered entrees and they took forever.  Two of our steaks were ordered medium rare and arrived well done. The waiter took the two plates away and returned them but not until the rest of our party were completely through with their dinner. The manager came to our table to ask about the service. We described our experience and an apology was made. However, the best part of this meal was when we left. Unfortunate!",

We were presented with a small taste from the kitchen as we perused the massive wine list (we had to restrict our looking to Italian wines, just to help the decision-making process) and looked over the menu. We started with the carpaccio, which was presented to us by the manager - along with some of the most special corn bread my husband has ever tasted.  My husband had the gumbo - which he declared was the MVP, and the hostess said she would pass that on - and I, the beet salad. I ordered the lamb shank entree that separated cleanly from the bone with merely a tug of my fork. My husband had a rib eye steak that was perfectly prepared and presented with several sauces.  I left a lot on my plates, trying not to be a glutton, but eating for flavor is easy to do. The Barolo we selected was an excellent pairing to all our selections, the cappuccino was prepared beautifully. The chairs were also immensely comfortable. Everything is set for a dining experience that will take time to savor, and no expense has been spared to insure this. Kevin and the entire team who took care of us were professionals at the top of their game.",

A second round of drinks was never delivered. Two desserts were ordered, only one was delivered.  When we went to pay, the ran the wrong amount on the credit cards.

When we arrived, on time, the restaurant was almost empty, yet we were told to wait in the bar for our table to be ready. When we did get a table, within minutes, it was in the middle of the floor with the rest of the empty tables on all sides. This became a significant fact as the evening wore in, as the bevy of waiters consistently jostled my chair as they made their way around the gradually filling room.  We dressed for a fancy birthday evening, and the majority of the patrons were dressed as well, but there were jeans and hoodies in attendance. The food was delicious, and the rib eye was perhaps the most perfectly cooked medium rare that I've ever had. The pork chop and cream cheese mashed potatoes was delicious, and the guappo salad was very tasty. We were treated to a small glass of champagne and a sorbet for dessert to recognize our occasion, which was very thoughtful. I wish I could give it the five stars that I wanted the experience to be, but the atmosphere didn't match the expectations.",

The service was on par with the best restaurants I\u2019ve been to, while not seeming too stuffy.  Favorite dish of the night? It\u2019s hard to choose one. We had the crispy pork cheek, turtle soup, duck breast, lamb shank, and Brussels sprouts. For me, it\u2019s a tie between the pork cheek and the lamb for my favorite dish of the night.  For dessert, we had the night\u2019s special of bananas foster tiramisu. Not a combination you would think works, and one that isn\u2019t immediately obvious even when eating it. But by the second bite you say \u201cah! I get it!\u201d  I have to say, I wasn\u2019t sure I would enjoy this as much as Paul Prudhomme, but I have to say I have a new favorite. Thank you, Delmonico, for an excellent evening!",
