My guy was super frazzled (new maybe? ) but everyone else was calm,  friendly,  and fast.  Ordered the rice bowl. You pick one bowl type, one protein and 4 toppings  plus a \"dab of sauce\". Everything is accurate to what they describe.  Mine was a scoop of rice (very good), good portion of shawarma (not overdone like some places.  Good flavor overall). I got hummus, olives,  feta,  and Mediterranean salad.  Super fresh. I think I may have gotten the wrong hummus,  but if not, that was my only dislike.  It was not smooth and didn't taste like chickpeas. Can't say it was bad just not what I was expecting.  Could gave used seasoning for sure.  The dab of sauce is too small! I got 2 and still too small!  I love sauce and the garlic one was great. They could be a bit nicer on the sauce portion. But the best.  The absolute BEST homemade pita EVER.  Lastly,  tried the begniets. Fine. Look like pillows like they should.  Too dense.   Get the baklava instead.",

Got the spicy chevap bowl with poblano hummus, onions, cabbage, bean and corn, garlic sauce and schug - the bowl was good size and the pita was great but sauces were small.
