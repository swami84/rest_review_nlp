Being from Taiwan, the food here holds a special place in my heart, especially since there are so few Taiwanese food options in the city.  My favorite things to get are the braised pork over rice, popcorn chicken, beef donburi, and Taipei special hot pot. The value of these dishes are amazing!! Especially the hot pot--so many restaurants only offer AYCE and I love that I can get a personal size hot pot here for $13.95 and it comes with a ton of food. I've tried a good half of the menu and would say everything is quite well made (you can't go wrong with any of the rice, noodle, or entree dishes) but a first timer should definitely stick with the popular dishes. For appetizers, I'd recommend the Taiwanese sausage, ba wan, gua bao, pig ears, preserved egg and tofu, and Taipei special mix.  The drinks are equally as good (but perhaps not as unique to Chinatown/Bridgeport) and my favorite drink is the milk tea trio that comes with boba, grass jelly, and pudding!",

They serve classic street food like oyster omelette, stewed pork over rice, etc. Overall it's the decent- it is the best you will find in Chicago , you don't really have other choices lol. Of course it's not as good as actual food in Taiwan, but that's expected. It's very very difficult to actually find great Taiwanese food outside of Taiwan. Some things are beyond their control like you can't find good fresh oysters in Chicago. In Taiwan you can literally go to oyster farm and watch people shuckle oysters as you order. The main downside is that this is street food- it's a bit difficult to make a meal out of coming here because they don't serve many options that are traditional dinner foods. And it's hard to have street food only in restaurants. Overall, if you never had Taiwanese food, come check it out. Keep in mind food in Taiwan is still going to be far better, and this style is not how people normally eat for actual meals.",

Nevertheless, the flavors in the rice boxes (especially side dishes like the tea egg and pickled vegetables) are just like what is served in Taiwan. Ordered pork belly, crispy spicy chicken, and braised chicken leg. Tried a little of each, and enjoyed all. The portions were huge, and I will be eating rice for days (no complaints).  If there\u2019s one thing I hope they change is their service: it was poor. I walked in, saw my pickup order sitting on the counter, but waited for one of the four counter people to acknowledge me. Two minutes later a second person walked in...and immediately they began to help her first. Managing the queue of customers in the order received should be the first thing a restaurant manager teaches their counter staff.",

We ordered several dishes and realized that the food tasted very blend and cheap. We were very disappointed. Having tried other Taiwanese restaurants in Chicago area, I can say that their food was the worst of all the Taiwanese restaurants in the area. Now here is the worst part of our experience at Taipei cafe: the restaurant server was incredibly, really, incredibly rude. The server spilled pork juice on my friend's shoes and saw that and walked away. We expected apology and some tissue papers immediately, but there wasn't an apology and tissue paper came several minutes later. We were a little upset and gave few percent less tip during check out than they requested (18%). But the server saw the tip and yelled \"why don't you just don't give me any at all\" and walked away. We were completely shocked. TRULY, THE WORST EXPERIENCE.",

Food was great for the price. There's enough to feed 2-3 for around 30 dollars worth. Popcorn Chicken is a must have appetizer and could pair well with alcohol. Beef Kimchi Donburi is my favorite and go-to at this restaurant. The Basil Chicken definitely gives enough meat to feed you even after leftovers so it's a must have also.  Drinks were perfect for the price. If you don't like too sweet of items or milky items, the blueberry green tea is perfect for you. It's a good mix of the flavors and is something different from milk tea.  Dessert options are immense and could feed most tastebuds. I didn't order, but I would recommend it. I personally like a good egg-waffle.  Parking is easy, right outside the restaurant. Guaranteed parking would be after high times which is around 8 pm. Going around dinner time might be hard to find parking.  Recommend: Popcorn Chicken + Beef Kimchi Donburi for a party of 1",

I ordered a mango honey toast and their matcha honey toast. The matcha one was really pretty and tasty as well with matcha and chocolate drizzled on the stacked up honey toast and even had a scoop of matcha ice cream inside! The mango honey toast on the other hand had chunks of mango with mango and whipped cream plus mango sauce on the stacked up toast and also a scoop of mango ice cream inside to finish it. We also order some other food as well, the basil chicken was very savory and tender/juicy. The Beef tendon? Noodle soup was also very good with a nice amount of meat, vegetables and noodles, a little bit spicy and sour because of the preserved lettuce? Cabbage? The next food is the (I forgot the name) it had pork belly which looked very fatty yet it didn't taste like it. It also have steamed broccoli and preserved thingie and a slice of pickled radish to top it off and finally we had the beef bouburi? Which in my personal opinion wasn't my taste but my brother really liked how yolky the egg was and the sweetish slices of beef under the egg and said that it was good. So we had a lot to take home from here and I would definitely be coming here to dine more often! Oh before I forget, their milk tea was fabulous and the tapioca was really sweet and soft. We also had the traditional rice roll which was really good but we end up taking that to go as well. Love their food and staff was also very polite and friendly!",

The menu itself has quite varieties, from meat to vegetarian dishes.  From all the dishes that we ordered, my favorite one is the tofu basil. The taste is more like \u201cSan Pei Ji\u201d (Taiwanese Three Cup Chicken). Another favorite is the Taiwanese Fried Spring Rolls, basically it\u2019s fried stuffed ground pork with seasonings.

We got ourselves a bowl of Danzai noodle soup, which had minced pork, overnight-soaked-in-soy-sauce egg or braised egg, and a whole head-on shrimp. Also, we were tempted to order Gua Bao, which was basically a bun with braised pork belly in light soy sauce and some vegetables including preserved cabbage, and 6-piece Housemade Potstickers, which was actually fried gyoza. The noodle was somehow not so impressed, as well as other foods. The pork belly, however, was very tender as it was almost melted in my mouth. Last but not least, we ordered a Hokkaido Milk Tea with bubble, which had a unique taste of Hokkaido cream. The milk tea tasted like milk candy but sweet just right Overall, with a significant number of sweet treats and milk tea, we will surely be back to try another dessert.",

It tasted a little bit sweet even though it shouldn\u2019t be. I could have given 3.7 stars for the taste but 5 stars for the overall experience. Definately will come back in the future.",

I came to this restaurant with my friends and asked the waiter for a noodle dish with absolutely no meat, telling him to replace the pork in the dish with more vegetables and that I did not eat any meat or fish. I received a plate of noodles that had shrimp on top and I had to send it back. I then received another plate of noodles with no apparent meat, but that was not worth the price at all. If you are avoiding meat, I wouldn't recommend coming to this restaurant as there are no vegetarian options.",

        "caption": "It was a Friday night and we caught wind of a new restaurant around Chinatown. I like the food, decor and concept, but the staff could really use a lesson in maximizing table turnover to get more people in and out more efficiently.  We got in around 6:30 and the first thing we noticed was the crowds of people in the entry hall/front bar. They said it would be a 40 minute wait, but it ended up being about 20. I had an Okinawa Milk Tea (the flavor comes from, or is at least based on, a roasted brown sugar syrup) which was fantastic, haven't had anything like it in Chinatown before. My main dish was the BBQ pork rice box. The pork was nice and crispy, but I wish I had a bit more sauce. The egg was flavorful, but not overpowering. The rice was topped with a seaweed-sesame seasoning blend which really brought more depth to the rice.  My biggest gripe came from the service. There was a virtual army of servers, but we had to track down our server after 10-15 minutes of time between finishing our meal and getting the check and again between getting the check and getting cashed out. As tables around us reached similar points in their meal, there was a definite noticable lag time where people would linger after their meal was over despite a crowd of people waited to be seated. The server or wait staff never came to make the closing portion of the meal convenient or quick. I'm not sure if that is a cultural difference, but the outcome is very apparent.  Overall, I like the place, but management should incorporate lessons from American restaurants on simple actions (removing plates as people finish, not after they leave; frequent followup with customers who are near the end of the meal; etc.) that can turn tables faster when training the servers. I would come here again to try some other foods, but I would avoid the big rush times until they get the service flow down.",
