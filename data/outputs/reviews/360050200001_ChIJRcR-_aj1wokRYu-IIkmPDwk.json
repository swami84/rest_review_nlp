I ordered a pick up order at 4pm, arrived to the store at 4:35pm, my  order was no where to be found. I checked the shelf 3 times before asking a extremely rude employee that was near the \u201cpick up shelf\u201d. She proceeded to look at me and mumbled \u201cits there\u201d I looked checked the shelf for the 4th time. I CAN NOT STRESS ENOUGH on how many times I tried to politely get an employees attention and ask for help. All 3 times I asked for helped they would ignored me and I\u2019m a pretty loud person so I doubt they didn\u2019t hear me.  Finally I believe the GM of the store came out (a rude pregnant lady) she started 1. Being rude and screaming at her staff and 2. Rude to me. She asked for my name then made the order VERY poorly.  I LEFT THE STORE AT 5:15pm btw. please order elsewhere its not worth the wait and time.",
