There was no one in the store and I sat in the corner and started studying for about 30 minutes. The man behind the counter who I believe said his name was Mike but I'm not positive because he didn't speak English very well told me to \"please leave\". I asked for a reason because I was simply just enjoying my coffee and reading for school but he didn't give me any except that I was sitting for too long and again insisted that I leave. It was extremely disrespectful especially considering I wasn't doing anything. I've studied at many Dunkin Donuts and this is the only one where I have been treated poorly and have been kicked out for doing nothing. Will never come back here again. Also the place has ants, which I discovered as I was being kicked out for reading. Go here if you want to be treated like garbage and get coffee in an unsanitary environment.",
