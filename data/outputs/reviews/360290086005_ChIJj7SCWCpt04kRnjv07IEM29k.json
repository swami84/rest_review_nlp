        "caption": "When I got a coupon for a new pizza place in the neighborhood, I figured I would give it a go. Ordered a cheese pizza and a single order or chicken fingers. The food looked great. The pizza was alright overall. It was cooked perfectly, with a nice crust. Not too crunchy, not too thick. I could have used a bit more flavor in the sauce, and a bit more sauce. That would have brought home the 5th star! It was still pretty good for a newer establishment. The portion on the fingers was generous. I'm a big fan of homestyle so I had to try em. I got the sweet BBQ. The sauce wasn't too sweet and had some nice tang. They were cooked perfectly, but could have been pounded down a bit. The blue cheese was a bit lackluster, but they gave us celery which is a bonus. I would definitely try eating there again.",
