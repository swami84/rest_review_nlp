Long version: The person (I feel terrible for not not asking for his name) who took our take-out order first offered us a glass of water because he knew we had been driving for long before that. He had our order ready. He was wearing a mask the right way and when we were paying, he sanitised our card, swiped, sanitised again and returned it. He sanitised the pen that we had to sign with. When one of my friends said she\u2019d go to the car, he said it may not be safe and walked her out to the car. He enquired about our families and gave us dessert to go. He was so warm that he literally reminded us of home. Now the food - we got home and ate our food only to feel instant regret that we didn\u2019t order enough to over eat. Not joking.  It was SO good and the way they had packed the whole thing was something else!  Overall, I recommend this place 10/10. When in Atlanta, be sure to go to Aamar\u2019s!",

I've definitely had my fair share of chicken tikka masalas and the sauce in this one is smooth and creamy and just right. Additionally, the samosas come fresh out of the kitchen when you're dining here and the pastry shell as well as the insides are just right. My wife also introduced me to pikora and that was a new and delicious experience. The only thing I would consider to be a con is the portion size. For the amount that you're paying for the dishes, the portions could probably be just a tad larger and in that respect I'd probably give a 4.75.  As far as the restaurant itself is concerned, it is definitely a hole in the wall type place nestled right next to the bottom floor of a parking garage. Perhaps 6 tables in total, 3 tables for 4 and 3 tables for 2. The food is served with disposable everything, likely because there is minimal room to perform dish washing duties. For this aesthetic reason, I'd probably give it 4.5 stars if that was a possibility.",

We went to roof top bar for drinks where they serve 0 food items so coming here to eat afterwards was a real treat and they\u2019re open till 11:30 pm. We got here fairly late so we were in hurry to order main course so didn\u2019t try much appetizers but we ordered Samosas which is available pretty much every Indian food place BUT the samosas here was so different and so tasty. All of the food we ordered was SO DELICIOUS and had NO FOOD COLOR everything was so freshly made. For the price this place can beat any high end Indian restaurant in my opinion. We have had food at some high end restaurant where they charge whooping $20 for one dish where here they charge half of that and food taste even better then the other places. We eat more than required and were so stuffed that we had to go for a walk afterwards. Must try this place once and you\u2019ll keep going back for sure.",

The food showed up lava hot and all together. Great.  Unfortunately the chicken curry had 4 peices of meat and the lamb masala had 5.  Very small amount of meat in our dishes.  Extremely disappointed.  But we will give it another shot in 2 weeks. Hopefully we dont get the same minimal amount of meat for 16 dollars per plate",

The establishment is clean and there is both indoor and outdoor eating. You can enjoy Indian music videos on two screens while you wait or while you eat.

You pay like $18 for a plate of biriyani but get a really little quantity of it. The meat pieces were so tiny and the serving was really really small compared to the price. Whereas in other Indian restaurants located in the perimeter of Atlanta you get a big filling plate of biriyani with 5-6 big chunks of meat almost at the same price. Disappointed.

        "caption": "I came for late dinner recently. This place gave me a major Indian local small restaurant vibe. The food at this place is downright amazing. I had chicken curries and biryani with tandoori appetizer. I would recommend this place for a pick-up instead of a dine-in. There are very few tables available and the place lacks ambience. The food is served in to-go boxes and expected to be consumed in non-reusable dishes. However, these drawbacks cannot contain the scrumptious recipes they unfold.",

The menu has a variety of Indian food which is expected, however, the food looks like it has been frozen, lacks taste and is presented in take out boxes. I have not had bad Indian food before and this was the first. Everything is served on plastic and for the average price of $14 per plate, I was surely expecting more. \ud83d\ude22",

The only drawback is the quantity. Biriyani quantity was very less for the price \ud83d\ude15. Cozy restaurant with just 5 tables, and good selection of bollywood YouTube video songs in the television. Would love to come back.

You haven't lived until a server gently bows while reverently placing a paper plate, napkin and plastic utensils in front of you :-) We only ordered Samosa appetizer, vegetable something-like-tika-masala and garlic naan. All three were as good as I've had anywhere. Wish this place was closer to home but I'll plan to eat here whenever we hit the Tabernacle in the future. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

The service is excellent and the staff of this family business is very kind and cheerful, and is considerate of others. There is free water for every person eating (of course) and free rice for every dish.  This is a very good place and you should definitely try this restaurant sometime.
