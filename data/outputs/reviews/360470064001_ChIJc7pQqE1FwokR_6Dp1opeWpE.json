Come on Thai is not my Thai. Came here 6 months into the pandemic hoping my Thai survived. It did not. Now I've only had take out from come on Thai because we weren't comfortable eating in yet but the dish portions were a far cry from the previous owners. The flavor was also lacking. Prices were about the same as my Thai when I last went (about $11-13 a dish, not including the lunch specials). I probably wouldn't come back for take out. Decor wise, it was nice. Had plenty of seats with outdoor seating as well. Would I come back for dine in eating? Leaning towards no but depends on how hungry I am and how badly I want mediocre Thai.",
