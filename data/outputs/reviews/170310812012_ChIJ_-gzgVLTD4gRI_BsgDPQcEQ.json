I placed a standard order and 17 minutes later, after everyone behind me had walked out with their orders (and long waits for them as well) I had to remind the staff of my order which clearly had been overlooked. Granted, one of the staff asked if there was anything complimentary they could provide me while I waited further, but at that point, I just needed my order to be complete. To boot, the order was hastily made and made incorrectly (I've just opened it up to eat it).  Every time I leave this location I swear it's my last but I have been willing to forgive past incidents of long waits, poor staff organization, as well as general under staffing.
