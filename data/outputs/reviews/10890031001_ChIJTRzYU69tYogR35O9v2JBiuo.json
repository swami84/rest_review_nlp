My husband, his friends, and I went to this bar to drink after going out. There was a creepy man sitting at the bar watching every move everyone made. Someone in our party took a shot and accidentally spit out some of his drink up while taking the shot. At this point the creepy man at the bar was upset about that and was watching our every move. My husband said a curse word in conversation and the creepy man spoke up and said we needed to leave. I asked this man to please mind his business. He then proceeded to tell me that this was HIS bar and it was his business... this man was very confrontational. Anyway I would avoid this place because it is very easy to upset \"the owner.\" I am assuming he does not like to have customers.",

It was quite windy but the heated ceilings paired with the clear pull-downs provided just enough warmth. At the bartender\u2019s recommendation, we tried the crispy potatoes and they had the perfect amount of seasoning and crisp - not to mention the ideal shareable! We tried a few different drinks (Orange Paloma, Moscow Mule, and Tequila Mojito) and all were delightfully refreshing. BarVista is such a fantastic addition to HSV and the perfect spot for an intimate group or couple while still maintaining social distance. Cannot wait for warmer weather to enjoy the terrace to the fullest! Views are a must-see, and the staff takes extremely good care of you. Service is top notch! A++",
