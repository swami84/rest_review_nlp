Brussels sprouts were good but nothing better than what I\u2019ve had before. We didn\u2019t finish them.  And who was our waiter? The lady who sat us down then disappeared or the gentleman who literally repeated the entire menu out loud for us when we can both read? I admit I drink a lot of water, but I had to request my glass to be refilled almost five times. One time she forgot. I had to stare at her while she stood at the kitchen doing nothing while waiting for a dish to come out. Why pick glasses that can\u2019t hold more than two sips of water? At least give the table their own bottle of water then.  Wine was good. Decor was nice looking. Booths had plush seating. We didn\u2019t get to try the broth, but we were told Frank\u2019s carries it frozen.  Wouldn\u2019t recommend. In the same area, I highly prefer Refried Beans around the corner for eating.

First thing manager says before I even open my mouth is \"that's not my problem.\" Showed him the Door Dash receipt. His reply? Sniffed, \"we are a fine dining establishment, we don't do Door Dash.\" I asked if that's the case, then why are they listed on the service, and how was I able to order food through them? \"I don't know why they have us listed there but it's wrong. You have to take it up with them.\" I protested and pointed out that I'd just called and was told the food was there, which is why I came in to get it. Also that if they are on Door Dash but don't want to be there, that is their issue to take up with the platform--not customers'. He then got loud, likely embarrassed that his business wasn't in order and unable to skirt it when faced with proof. The hostess and chef then joined in with him. At that point I was upset, and left.  Aside from the poor customer service and tone/attitude, when I mentioned I'd be posting on Yelp, I got back a nasty \"Sure, go ahead, tell Yelp!\"  What I didn't say is that I grew up in this neighborhood, the very one in which they've set up shop and joined the wave of gentrification washing over Washington Heights. The same kind of gentrification that ushers in newcomers who look down on those of us with deep roots here.  The way I was yelled at, admonished \"this is a fine dining establishment\" (as if my college-educated, six-figure salary-making Dominican self didn't know that--why else do you think I ordered from you?), and effectively hustled out had a strong whiff of the prejudice and discrimination long-time residents often face when gentrifiers arrive. I've actually chosen to stay and invest in the neighborhood that raised me as opposed to you, who probably picked us up like the proverbial new instrument you'll tire of in a few years.  Will share this with the considerable members of the community I know so that they don't set one foot in your fine dining establishment.  God, I hope you go spectacularly bankrupt. You're already there morally, shouldn't be a long trip.",

You (at least I assume it was you) also saw us and did not bother to acnowledge. Instead of making excuses and pointing fingers, it might be a better move for you to apologize, and ask us to try you out again, while trying to correct what is clearly a visible customer service lapse.  EDIT 2 - the owner of this place is clearly a liar. After looking at some of the other reviews here it seems that you remember every person who comes in weather they eat here or not, and apparently you always have an excuse as to why it's not your fault your service sucks. Stop calling people liars, and start working on improving your business.",

There was a real charm to the experience. The second visit was good, we enjoyed it but just felt like a regular restaurant experience - no disappointment, but no magic either. Finally, last night was pretty 'meh' - started with a bit of miscommunication and ended with just a general feeling of unwelcome.  Not every restaurant has great nights, and I'd still recommend others try Pandering Pig (I like what the owners are trying to do there), but at $70 per person (w/ a single glass of wine), definitely won't be rushing back.",

It\u2019s a small place, and the hostess and another person were in the back, noticed us standing but ignored us for awhile, which was a very strange experience. Usually when someone enters a restaurant you\u2019re immediately greeted or at least acknowledged in some way. I checked my phone and saw they had been open for about an hour and a half, so it wasn\u2019t like we were there right as the restaurant opened. Every single table was open and there was very little activity going on.  After a while the hostess finally walked up, greeted us and asked us if we had any reservations. We told her we didn\u2019t, and then she told us that they were all booked up for the night but we could sit at the bar and eat there. Mind you there were no other customers there, just me and my partner.  It was a tiny bar in the back and there was someone\u2019s coat on a chair next to where we would be seating so it was once again kinda strange. When I thought about how simple it would be to coordinate and seat us at the table with the last reservation time I just made the call to just leave.  If a restaurant is empty it makes little sense to say that the place is simply too busy to properly serve you. A good restaurant would not make someone sit at the bar while there\u2019s no one sitting at any tables or ordering any food.  Maybe in the future I\u2019ll make a reservation ahead of time (keep in mind there\u2019s no warning or suggestions anywhere online that reservations are needed for this place) or get lucky and actually get to sit down at a table and try the food, but until then I can\u2019t recommend this place.",

Granted, this is a wine bar, and my brother and I came in at 10pm on a Friday and wanted to order beer. But they have a tap list of at least five or six beers, and a couple of bottles, one of which was a cider.  When he saw us looking at the beer side of the menu, he was quick to make a disclaimer that some kegs that arrived today had been shaken, and we might have to try a couple different options. I went for a bottled cider. My brother ordered the namesake Pandering Pig Pilsner.  It was flat. Flat flat flat. And yet when we tried to explain that to the guy, he said no, the keg had just been tapped. Rather than offering a different beer, he took the glass back and offered to put more of a head on it, which was confusing.  My brother and I discussed our confusion, and I decided to get up and intercept this \"re-heading\". I told the proprietor I didn't think it would help, the beer was flat. Then, rather than actually TASTING THE BEER, he stuck to his story of it being a fresh keg, and KICKED US OUT.  Called us \"amateurs\". Nice.  Dude. Maybe try believing your customer when they send something back because it doesn't taste right.  We were reasonable, non-belligerent customers who just wanted to sit and have a quiet beverage.",

It is a very intimate restaurant, with not a lot of seating but the it is in the form of couches/booths which give it a nice intimate feel. The chef and her husband interact with diners and give you an extensive detailed rundown of the menu with descriptions of each plate. The food is all farm to table and Napa valley inspired. We tried the cheese board which was amazing. A wonderful mix of complementary cheese and fruits, some cheeses I have not had before. It was very well thought out. We also has the fig and olive tapenade which was also very delicious. For dinner, we had the coq au vin and the lamb shank. The lamb shank is what hey are known for - you will not be disappointed. We also had the coq au vin which was ver flavorful. Both are very healthy portions. We had a great time and will be coming back again. It's a wonderful restaurant to have in this area.",

This was one of the few times in my life I've paid $28 for an entree and felt it was absolutely worth every penny. (I had the lamb shank.) With every bite, my husband and I kept grinning at each other in amazement. SO much care has been put into everything they do; you leave feeling grateful and sort of absurdly in love with everyone there! We'll return as often as we can. If you're looking to dine on the cheap, skip the entrees and get a salad or soup and a glass of wine. You'll still be dining like royalty.  I just can't recommend this highly enough. A date night here is the best couples therapy you can buy. :)",

Nice exposed brick wall on one side, and earthy tone color wall on the other. Not much lighting fixtures, but with large windows covering the entrance side of the wall, it gets a lot of natural lights. Well, until the Sun goes down.  It was still early when we got there, so they had some empty tables, so we got seated right away. Then the complimentary bread, which were nice and soft, moist and tasty. The butter was a bit too hard, I wish if they didn't keep them in a refrigerator...  Everything we ordered were pretty good, but the portion was very small. It was good that we were not super hungry. Otherwise, it would not have been enough.We shared an appetizer, then had main dish, and shared a dessert. None of the items are not really for sharing, since they are too small of a portion to share.  The service was ok, it was better at first, then got very slow. The dinner took a little longer time than expected because of that, but we were not in a hurry, so that was ok. The food was good, but the small portion for the price tag is a bit high for me. I might go back for something else, but it will be when I am not super hungry. Read my full review of this restaurant and food on my food blog, foodlovergirl.",
