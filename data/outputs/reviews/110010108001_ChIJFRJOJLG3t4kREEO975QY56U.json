My toddler and I were planning on picking up our order and picnicking outside but the temperature dropped and got a little too dark. The staff accommodated us not only with no judgment on our not-so-dinner-ready attire but also swiftly gave us a nice table and our food just minutes after. We were able to enjoy the amazing chicken parmigiana and their delicious pizza and since we were now eating in, we ordered dessert. They even provided warm milk for my little one upon request in a perfect sized espresso cup!  She was delighted, and so was I. We both loved the sugared donuts and I got to enjoy my cappuccino. Every single person who we came in contact with was pleasant, friendly and kind. The atmosphere was so welcoming and as a tired Mom with a hungry toddler it was perfectly unexpected and felt special. If you\u2019re looking for a delightful restaurant and delicious Italian in Washington DC, this is your spot. Thank you to everyone at North Italia, we plan to be back ASAP!",

Service was horrendous, our server was initially nice, but the cauliflower tasted like someone dumped an entire cup of salt on the egg. We figured it happens and they arent perfect.  Then tbe supposedly medium rare+ wagyu entrees came and they were well done, and ofcourse, beyond salty. I was starving so I tried to just eat it, but the anount of salt was making me feel dehydrated half way thru the meal. In addition, they did not do a 2 minute check back or CHECKED BACK WITH ME AT ALL AFTER giving us our entrees. Who does that!?  The manager didnt seem to care, prob figured I was trying to get free food and has no idea I come in at least a few times a month consistently.  Their new post-COVID chef prob cooks way too salty and they havent realized it yet.  This place is normally so good, what a massive dissapointment.",

At this one, our waiter was very friendly but a little scattered, taking a long time between getting our waters and taking our orders (although he did apologize).  The bigger issue was the food - the zucchini chips were sliced too thin and fried hard, so they tasted a little burnt, the mussels were flavorful but undercooked and squishy, and a third of them didn't open, and the bolognese was decent, but I had just had it in Dallas where it was excellent. The sauce tasted under-simmered, not as rich as it could have been, and the noodles were good but not perfect, a little gummy. Overall, I think this kitchen needs to step it up if the chain is going to maintain quality standards.",

The staff was really nice, serving sizes were big, everyone at our table enjoyed the food, and the desserts (we got tiramisu and gelato) were incredible. I took off one star, though, because the vegetarian options were lacking. I think there was salad, a pizza, and maybe a pasta (can't remember), but that's it. A little more variety, especially from an Italian restaurant (even just saying that they can make dishes without meat in the pasta section of the menu), would be nice. But I'll definitely be back, maybe just for wine and a dessert. Side note: they give you a free dessert on your birthday. My friend did this and got a really big dessert for free.",

I noticed a decline in service my second time around but I figured I\u2019d give this place another try because all waiters can\u2019t be the same. After all, it was the food that kept  bringing me back. And so, I returned but only for take out. Still, each time my order was messed up; either there would be a missing item or the wrong food will turn up on my table. But even that I could live with! Servers are not always at their best and even the kitchen\u2014 any kitchen\u2014 is bound to mess up once or twice. What I cannot live with:  dishonest practices, and I do not support dishonest businesses. I noticed today that my bill was higher than it should\u2019ve been and prompted the hostess to tell me why I did not have an itemized receipt of my food. She played it off by avoiding the question to assure me that my birthday dessert had not been accounted for. I wanted to be polite so I told her that I would take her at her word. The bill seemed high so, when I got home, I went online and checked out the menu ; this is when I learned that they overcharged , as I thought they had, by about $20 dollars. I ordered one pizza of the today, one soup of the day, two kids spaghetti\u2018s, and one donut dessert. I paid $83.60 How?  I will not know as I didn\u2019t waiste any energy demanding an itemized bill after meeting some resistance from the hostess. But I do know, however, that I will not be returning...",

Lovely restaurant, beautifully decorated, very clean, and super friendly hostess greeting people at the door. Unfortunately things went downhill.  Our server, while polite and professional, was not very outgoing or friendly. I'm assuming someone was training with him that day because he had another server following him around, but I found it odd that he didn't tell us this since normally that's what I've seen.  I was in a party of two and we each ordered a drink and appetizer to start when we arrived at 6pm. The restaurant had maybe 5 other tables there and it took us almost 15 minutes to get our drinks. We then ordered our main meals. At 6:45pm (45 minutes after being seated) we finally got our appetizers. The servers basically disappeared during this waiting time, and only came by once about 20 minutes in to let us know the appetizers were almost ready. We also had to ask for clean plates since our bread plates were dirty. It took 2 tries to get plates that were totally clean.  The truffle bread appetizer was absolutely delicious! Unfortunately the avocado salad had avocado that was very brown. Our main meals arrived about an hour after sitting down (7pm). I had the squid ink pasta for my main meal, and while the pasta was very good, the shrimp were super overcooked and tough. My friend had the chicken pasta which he enjoyed a lot.  I wanted to try dessert, but was afraid it would take too long. We asked for our check which came quickly, but after providing our credit cards it took almost 10 minutes to get them back.  Mostly my complaints are about the long delay. For a simple meal with two people and a fairly empty restaurant, it took us 1 hour and 40 minutes to have dinner. I would have been okay with this if someone had explained the delay to us, but we were treated as if it was normal. I wasn't super upset with the food quality, and overall it was acceptable and still tasty.",

We missed happy hour just by a few minutes, we thought it ended at 7P, but Happy Hour ends at 6PM, fyi.  So get there early!  Well my friends and I got a few drinks and some snacks to share.  The grilled bread with burrata was delicious!  That grilled bread tho, can I have some more!  yumm!  I didn't care for the overly sweet jam in this dish, but the burrata was creamy! We also tried the calamari, crispy and tender, served with arugula and half a lemon.  No complaints there!  Another was their Zucca chips!  Basically thinly sliced and deep fried zucchini!  That was very tasty.  I'd definitely come back here again for their happy hour, or even on a dinner date sometime!  Hopefully soon! =)",

The Burrata Tortellini and Hazelnut Torta, and Sangria were the stand-outs of the night while the White Truffle Garlic Bread, Margherita Pizza, Apple Bourbon missed the mark.  Apple Sour Bourbon (2/5) - The heap of ice really diluted from the flavor. Couldn't taste the Apple-soaked Bourbon or the spices in the drink. After a few sips, the $12 cocktail was quickly depleted. Definitely get the sangria over the bourbon - tastier and cheaper!  Red Sangria (5/5) - Fruity and perfect blend of brandy, red wine, blood orange, and strawberries. Not a big fan of sangria at restaurants, but this one was fruity and not sugary. Skip the pricey cocktails and go straight for the sangria!  White Truffle Garlic Bread (2/5) - While it's served in a pipping hot skillet cooked in the gas-fired pizza oven, the grilled bread was smothered in greasy olive oil. Where was the white truffle? Kept searching for it in every bite and finally gave up. While the heap of housemade ricotta and parsley garnish were tasty, they couldn't balance out the olive oil.  Margherita Pizza (1/5) - Watching the pizza cook in a nice flame with a soft pillowy crust, the Neapolitan pizza looked so promising, but sadly a disappointment! The impostor pizza was coated in cheap mozzarella cheese and undercooked. For $15.50, I was expecting dollops of fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese. Best part? The crispy garlicky pillowy crust.  Burrata Tortellini (4/5) - Hands-down the stand-out entree of the night! The creamy burrata cooked al dente was divine! Tortellini is among the most difficult pastas to cook (I can never get it right!). The tomato sugo sauce was a bit too runny as the pasta didn't absorb the sauce. Sadly, I couldn't enjoy them together, a thicker chunkier sauce would do the trick.  The Hazenut Torta (5/5) - Saving the best for last! The decadent chocolate torta sitting on a bed of nutella sauce with crunchy hazelnut toffee pieces atop creamy salted gelato melting down was the perfect sweet ending to our meal. Although we didn't have room for dessert, glad we still went for it!  After dropping $250 on 7 dishes (Prosciutto Buschetta, Chicken Parm, and Filet Mignon), we were stuffed - but not truly satisfied.  Get pretty packed on Sat nights, luckily there were a small table open for the 3 of us for a walk-in. If you have a larger group, definitely make a reservation.  Would be back for happy hour on the weekdays for $5 sangria and bruschetta. I prefer Flower Child next door - tastier food that's also more affordable. A better bang for your buck!",
