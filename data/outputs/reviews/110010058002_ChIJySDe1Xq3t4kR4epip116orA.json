I enjoyed every ingredient in my build it yourself salad. I did an almost job choosing my ingredients and they did a good job delivering! The dressing on the salad aka icing on the cake lol was once you\u2019re done with your salad requests they mix the salad up for you! Soooooo awesome. So delicious! I want more! I\u2019ll be back for more. First time in DC!",

When I finally got a team member to answer, they said my order was left behind by accident. Only two orders were placed by my office, and my colleague got hers. It seems implausibly inept to forget one of two. When I do manage to get my salads (always, at least 40 minutes late) the proportions are off. Too much lettuce and not enough toppings, but unfortunately, I work in the take-out food desert of Penn Quarter so I have to keep making futile efforts. During lunch, they are busy and understaffed.
