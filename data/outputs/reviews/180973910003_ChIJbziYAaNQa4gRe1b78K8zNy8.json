There were 2 employees working there so the girl took our order by herself although the line started piling up, and the other employee labeled containers and blatantly ignored the drive through headsets saying 'they'd come in if they want it badly enough', not to mention he made excessively irrelevant jokes the whole time. They only had 2 kinds of bread, I had to repeat my order 3 different times to the gal helping us, our sandwiches were very skimpy, and the line finally grew long enough to warrant the man helping her. I have some understanding for the girl because I think she was new, but overall our experience was very unprofessional and sloppy. I hate having to leave negative reviews :(",

We were running a bit late so we decided to go to finish our run first and then head back to eat at the establishment.  I come to find out that my vehicle was no longer there when I returned. I promptly approached the drive-thru window and asked the two employees  where my vehicle was. To which one responded rudely and without facing me that my vehicle had been towed (My girlfriend was parked next to me and her vehicle was there). The same  employee (who's name I cannot pronounce) said that they were coming for her vehicle. We left her keys in my car for safe keeping before the charity race. We had to wait while a family member came to pick me up and take me to the impound. Once there the receptionist told me that the employee had called them saying that they needed the vehicle towed because it was blocking the way for other vehicles to park there. That was a complete lie. I have pictures that there were no more than 4 vehicles total. They saw us dressed as Santa clause for the charity and it was clear that they did it out of spite. And on top of that when my girlfriend went to ask for a manager they were very rude to her. To which once I came back after paying $175 for 30 minutes of being at the impound (because I was waiting for a ride) I went in and asked for the name of the manager and they were rude to me too. I understand if you need the parking space for people , but there were non, we were going to give you our business after the half marathon (people get hungry) but after this I am very displeased and will never eat at your establishment again. Your employees need to be nicer to people.  #santahustle",
