Absolutely tasty food in record time!  I don't know how they do it, but they do it!  They deliver it to you hot and fresh in 30 minutes or less!!  Tonight I placed an order online, as opposed to going there and picking it up myself, and there was a little snafu with the delivery driver.  When I called to complain, the manager remained courteous and gracious and even gave me a large discount for \"my troubles\".  I called her back and apologized for being such a ginormous beatch!  I should have been more understanding.  This place is packed with orders all the time and there is bound to be mistakes.  Nevertheless, she was gracious and very generous with her discount.  The food was delicious (as usual) and again, you cannot beat the prices and they really do have your food ready in less than 30 minutes!  Amazing service, food and price!  Domino's has won my heart over other more expensive eateries!",

I will be one of those people. Today I called twice and she kept saying hello like she couldn't hear me even though I was speaking loud and clear. It honestly feels like she does it on purpose. I was on a call before I called Domino's and the person could hear me just fine. The first call.. okay. The second time.. don't think so. You think she'd be happy she has a job during the pandemic.

Having been burned by this location before, I called at 7pm to check on the status of the order. The woman who answered asked \"Is it ok if we deliver it by 8? We are really backed up.\" I said the entire purpose of ordering in advance was to get it on time. She assured me it would be delivered on time. At 7:05, the app said my order had started (!) to be processed. At 7:30, the app said my order had been canceled. We called the location twice; we were on hold for several minutes and then it sounded like the store was just picking up the phone and hanging it up. My husband had to run out to Chipotle to get us dinner. Super frustrating when something that is supposed to be convenient and fast turns out to be stressful and unreliable.

He asked if I wanted a 'coupon'.  Then asked me what I wanted him to do.  It was bizarre, and horrible service.  I opted to cancel the order.  My boyfriend then noticed a Dominos delivery vehicle outside our building just sitting there.  We were watching a movie, and after another 20-30 minutes, my phone rang, and it was the delivery guy.  Keep in mind, he never left the vehicle.  Again, completely bizarre.  The fact that I live in Lakeview means this place is not worth my time or energy.  I would highly recommend that you choose another pizza place.",
