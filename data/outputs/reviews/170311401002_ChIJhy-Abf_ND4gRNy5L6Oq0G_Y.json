We ordered donar sandwiches after they took our order the waiter  came and said that they didn\u2019t have it, then we ordered lahmacun also didn\u2019t have it. We ended up ordering beef sandwiches. They lady said it\u2019s made in special Turkish bread which sounded good. I requested the meat well done. They took too long to bring food to our table even though they weren\u2019t busy. When they brought the sandwiches they were cold , meat was red inside. No sauce or anything in the sandwiCh , literally bunch of red onions , lettuce and four small pieces of undercooked meat. And the special \u201cbread\u201d turned out to be regular flour tortillas which wasn\u2019t even cooked it was plain white, I guess that\u2019s why the sandwich was cold. We asked the server whether that\u2019s the usual wrap they use as we were told it\u2019s turkish bread, he said he doesn\u2019t know.  I wish I could give less than one star. Save your money and go somewhere else because they don\u2019t care.",

The restaurant is clean and the food is tasty  They have great desserts, juicy, tasty kebabs as well as special Turkish delight and turkish coffee on sand.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.",

When I got back home, it was clear that some of the baklavas does not have pistachio in it. The ones with no pistachio called `Durum baklava` and `Dilber baklava` in their website.  As you will see, some varieties have crushed pistachios. Some have ground pistachios, as a paste. But in some,  so clear it is something else.  So, if these varieties do not have pistachio in them, why did you sell them to me as they have? If they do not have pistachio in them, why did you charge me the pistachio price? And whatever you use in them, definitely not walnuts or pistachios, why don't you let people know, so they know what they are paying for?  Don't you know, Our'an says:  Woe to those who give less Who, when they take a measure from people, take in full. But when they have to give by measure or weight to men, give less than due.

I'm giving 2 stars because of the dessert. Otherwise it is 1 star. Maybe you can visit this place for a dessert but definetely not for a dinner or a lunch!!!  I recommend 'Cafe Istanbul' instead...",

I can go on and on about how good the food is and how amazing the customer service. I would like to thank Mr. Shahin for the amazing and Wonderfull sweet he has served my family I have never tasted anything like it before especially the Midye Baklava it is sooooo delicious thanks to the hands that made it!!... I ordered to go and by the time I arrived to Missouri it was finished the next morning I ordered a whole tray and arrived about 2 days later perfectly safe and perfectly rapped up.. I could go on and on about how good this restaurant is..... very highly recommended I give this 10 stars not a 5... :-)",

Baklava is real one like in Turkey, ice creams are literally real Marash ice cream. We liked the bread, lentil soup, lahmacun and mixed grill kebaps. The man who takes the orders very nice and helpful. If you are looking different places, try this one !!! However we liked it very much, the prices are little higher maybe they need to work on it somehow! By the way, it\u2019s halal food for now, but I recommend always ask before you order make sure about it!",
