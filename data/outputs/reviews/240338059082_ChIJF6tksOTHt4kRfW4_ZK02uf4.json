        "caption": "For this week's effort to support local businesses, our food delivery app recommended a brand new West African restaurant called Ivo that is located in the Hyattsvile Regal Theater complex across from the Mall of Prince George's (aka PG Plaza)  The cuisine is from Ivory Coast, specifically.  I ordered braised fish.  I got the entire fish from head to tail.  It was massive!  The fish was very succulent and tasty.  Not dried at all and well seasoned but NOT overseasoned! It also was not salty or greasy and oily! A PLUS for someone watching their cholesterol.  It was very KETO friendly because it was served with an onion and diced cabbage slaw and a tomato based pepper sauce on the side.  The fish is really bony however but the bones were very thick so you could avoid choking on them if you're not used to eating bony fish.  The portion is so large it could feed 2 people!  By yourself,  you could arguably divide up eating this fish into 4 meals: You could eat this for lunch, dinner and then lunch again and a snack!  For $18.99 you also get to pick a free side!  I got the plaintains and we got plenty in the small carton that came in the bag.  This is a steal of a price compared to what other area Afrian restauants charge for a full entree.  It arrived super fast (like under 20 minutes) and was piping hot and fresh!  I will definitely order there again especially bc they are so close to where I live.  By the time I ordered in the evening, most of their most popular dishes were sold out so that tells me this place is a hidden gem that has already been discovered by locals who are keeping it quiet and to themselves.  And for that reason, I will skip blabbing about them in my Next Door app but will help them out by giving them good reviews in Uber Eats, Postmates, Door Dash,  Google Biz and Yelp and Facebook.",
