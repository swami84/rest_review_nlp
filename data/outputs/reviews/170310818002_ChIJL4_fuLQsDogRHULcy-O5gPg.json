Now normally I don't mind but I was worried about the hair getting into things it was so big and clearly not natural. The hosts were nice but mostly overly friendly to the point that it seemed like an act and a little mocking. Many times I laughed at my waiter because I just couldn't take the exaggerated responses I got every time i asked for something. When he asked me if I had ever been there before I said no and he said \"Welcome to Japanese food\" like somehow me not eating there meant I had never had Japanese food before? It was an off experience to be sure. I ordered a bowl of shoyu ramen and it literally tasted like nothing. It was hot and the noodles were well cooked. The egg was not cooked correctly as it was hardboiled incorrectly (should be a little congealed in the center, not fully cooked) but literally the bowl tasted like nothing.NOTHING. (How do you do that?) I had to spice it to hell to give it a flavor. That is the first time I have ever had to do that to ramen and I have had bad ramen but there has always been a flavor.  The final straw for me and why I will not be back is the fact that in their over zealous need to make me *see* that the food is good or that they know what they are doing the owner came over and began to tell me the difference between the ramens after I had already finished and was looking to pay and trust me I didn't ask for the lesson. I will not be making the trip back soon.",

I don\u2019t normally leave reviews, but this experience was particularly appalling so I have to say something.... they served me clearly bad fish, told me I was wrong, and then still expected me to pay for it even though it was unpalatable.  I went with some friends after work and I ordered a rainbow roll and some gyoza. As soon as the roll arrived, the whole table was filled with a foul \u201cfish\u201d smell, like a fish market. Anyone who knows fresh sushi knows this is a red flag.  I tried a piece anyway, and it left a foul fishy taste in my mouth. Others at the table tried a piece and agreed there was something wrong with the roll.  I very politely mentioned it to the waitress and she took the rest of the roll away... and returned with the owner who assured me the fish was fresh and tastes fine. I disagreed, stating I\u2019ve had hundreds of rainbow rolls and this one was very clearly bad. The whole table reeked.  She then asked me which part of the roll was bad (seriously?) .... I said all of it. The two pieces I ate were not good. And she said specifically which part, so I said I tried the salmon and tuna. And she returned with the sushi chef and a plate with a salmon fillet on it... she then points at the chef and told me \u201che would know if the fish is fresh, he knows the taste\u201d. And refused to acknowledge that they served me a bad roll.  They literally served me bad fish, told me I was wrong, and then made me pay for it.  I will never eat at this restaurant again, and neither will any of my friends who were there to witness me being flat-out robbed by this place.  I highly suggest you find a different restaurant for sushi. Seriously.",

I do not eat sea food, and this restaurant is not a suitable location for someone like me. I can't judge the seafood, but from the way my colleagues were eating their food I suspect it was delicious. Service was amazing and very nice. I just wished they had a few more non seafood options and more ways of cooking. They had more pork options as well, but I don't eat pork.",

In a great location in River North, I would highly suggest to them an investment in a professional branding/marketing designer, because I had not heard of it, and the only reason I found it was because I really wanted Udon. Their beef Udon soup was the epitome of savory, umami goodness. Somehow it heated up even better in the microwave the next day. I ordered mine extra spicy and they gave me cayenne and chili oil on the side. Delicious! If you\u2019re not a fan of mushrooms, I would ask for them taken out; if you are a fan of a variety of Japanese mushrooms, you\u2019re in luck! Fried chicken appetizer was d e l i c i o u s, crispy and savory dark meat in a unique breading, I REALLY wish it came with sweet & sour sauce. Gyozas were delicate and also savory. Did not care for the tough texture of the octopus balls. Service was okay, it was hard to get their attention when we wanted to leave. Bathroom was unfortunate :(",

The waitress was really good, especially considering the fact she was the only waitress in the entire restuarant.

A very relaxed atmosphere the lights a dim (to a nice point), and the music is some nice chill jazz. I ordered the Cocoro Combo number 1, which comes with an assortment of raw fish and a California roll. The raw fish did not have a fishy taste, and it was delicious and well worth the money. Highly recommend.",

The food came out timely and the staff was friendly the whole time. The ramen though was very subpar. The noodles themselves looked and tasted like something you'd grab out of a bag of Maruchan. The broth wasn't very flavorful either. The egg was hardboiled and cold in the center as opposed to soft boiled and having that molten yolk I crave when grabbing ramen. The pork too was not flavorful at all and tasted as if it had no seasoning. Overall this ramen was just very meh. Considering all the other amazing ramen spots in the city, this isn't somewhere I will be coming again. Not for ramen at least.",
