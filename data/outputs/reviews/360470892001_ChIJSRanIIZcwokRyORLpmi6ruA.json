It it very tasty and has a nice spice that I like in my food. Also I've had some \ud83e\udd80 crab cakes which are delicious. My latest dish was Shrimp Mac and cheese and season fries. I recommend those who haven't been here to give it a try. As a tip for those who need a visual of the food their Instagram handle is @spunkfiahandthings.
