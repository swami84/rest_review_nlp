I had short ribs, and my husband had fried chicken. They were fresh and moist, absolutely scrumptious.  For dessert, the homemade brownie is truly the best dessert I\u2019ve had in a restaurant- maybe ever. You cannot go wrong!  The best part was the entire dining experience, including our waiter, Vinny! He was so attentive and personable, and we absolutely loved his energy and personality.

Burger expert said burger was outstanding! with fresh bun, delish pickles and pimento cheese and bacon marmalade. Trout was fabulous!!! gnocci were fried, chewy and fun, greens were buttery. Another hit! Ramen was loved by son with seafood and a hefty kick of spicy but my wife found it waaaay too smokey. I tasted it and am also at a loss as to why it tasted like liquid smoke??? Still, someone loved it. However one star removed for   incredibly slow, mediocre service during a quiet evening and terrible, partially inedible waygu steak. Our party requested medium rare but sirloin is a tougher cut so that the red center was impossble to chew. Either menu should reccomend  medium or perhaps cut differently but expect tough going if you order m.r. Everyone left the center on plate! Fries were delishious but not hot, lobster mac and regular mac were rich, delectable creamy and just so cheesy! Appetizers were octopus and poutine.  Poutine was good and Octopus was exquisite, crispy edges, tender and light sweet bbq flavor, though whatever it was sitting on was sadly unremarkable, though i feel it had real potential if it were more flavorful. I would have done 4 1/2 stars but not an option.",

I have celiac disease and explained that to our waiter when I asked about their fryer and gluten free bun options. Unfortunately, when my food came out the salad contained not gluten free croutons. Thankfully I noticed it right away and asked the lady that brought my plate out about it. She seemed confused but apologized and brought out another plate. My disease is such that my symptoms occur hours later. So as I sit on my couch in terrible pain today, I know whatever they did to \"fix\" my plate was not safe. I'm disappointed becuse there were other things marked GF on the menu like the shrimp and grits that I'd love to come back and try, but I don't think the staff understands allergies or celiac disease enough for me to safely eat here again. And I certainly understand there are risks eating out, but when you explain extensively and the waiter talks to the chef, you feel like the issues should be minimal. Disappointed.",

My bf had the fillet and said it was perfectly cooked! We also had some nice cocktails - Kiwi Jalape\u00f1o Margarita & Kentucky Mule. Both were tasty and you could tell they did not skimp on the alcohol. Which I always appreciate! Overall great place & we will definitely be back!",

Some restaurants really struggle with this.  The only negative I can think of is that there weren't enough bathrooms for our larger group. There are two downstairs and two upstairs.

The person told us they were getting ready for dinner. In fact, there was a lot of activity with servers setting tables in the room we were sat in making for a rushed feel to our meal. After looking at the menu, we discovered only about a quarter of the menu was available to us. Would have been nice to have this information posted on their website, or close between lunch and dinner if you're not willing/able to offer your full menu. We ordered the Southern Caesar Salad and had grilled chicken added as protein. The salad was $12, and the chicken was an additional $12.  We paid $24 for a small salad. For that price, it would have been nice to have one of the entrees listed on the menu.",

There were groups playing card games  inside. I'm assuming they didnt carpool as our group did. I say this because the inside wasn't crowded with customers ordering food. Outdoor seating also had plenty of open tables at noon. Our waiter, David, was excellent. Told us the wine by glass or bottle was half price on Wednesday. Food was very good. Delicious chicken salad sandwiches, sweet potato fries, fresh seasonal fruit, chef salads. Reason for 4 stars is parking.",

Chick Fil a fried chicken is better then my 22 dollar fried chicken. The mashed potatoes were good was the only thing I ate off my plate that I liked. Asparagus was almost raw said grilled on the menu. The other people in my party had issues with their food too none of us finished our dinner. We won't be returning.",

Secondly, they are very undeserving of being able to charge such prices for food quality that doesn't match such a price range. I ordered a rare NY strip steak and it came to the table with inedible silver skin along the entire side where it was removed from the t bone. A huge amateur mistake you might see at an Outback Steakhouse or another equivalent establishment. I'm not saying they are bad, just that they serve good food at the appropriate price and I would have preferred them tonight instead of what I had at The Mill. Sadly, the others in my party were also unhappy with their meals and no one finished any entree before we collectively decided to leave as a group. We will not be coming back as we were told the chef was made aware of my issues and no one from the front of the house or the kitchen seemed concerned enough to do anything about it.",

Overall, good experience and I hope to return to select and eat from their full menu.",

My husband got the shrimp and grits which tasted frozen then charred on the grill. The grits were overly filled with fatty ham that over powered any other flavor in the dish other than the odd sand-like quality and flavor that was present. I got the ramen on a whim and was also disappointed, the shrimp were very rubbery and also tasted as if they were frozen as well. The dish also had over cooked store bought tasting andouille sausage in it that completely over powered everything in the dish and the noodles were flavorless. The only good thing in it was the fresh mushrooms and green onion. We're very disappointed as this restaurant has good reviews - however I'm glad we chose to try it as a couple rather than bringing a group there when Roswell has much better things to offer.",
