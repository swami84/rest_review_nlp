Also very expensive compared to other poke places I\u2019ve been to that have just as fresh fish but you get a lot more poke for you money. Had to supplement my poke bowl with an ala carte order of just poke which was another $7.00 on top of my $8.50 poke bowl with $2 extra dollars because they gave me a lil spoon or avacado and a little spoon of tobiko.  I don\u2019t mind paying for good quality but it was just ok and nickel and diming everything with small portion sizes is not that good!

Staff were all friendly and willing to explain and give recommendations. I had tuna, sushi rice, avocado and edamame. Was amazing!!! The seasoning was so good, just a perfect combination of simple ingredients at its freshness and best! One of the thing i miss most of Hawaii!

Run by the same Japanese family that owns the famous MOKU surf shop located right up towards the beach.  This new small but excellent poke shop serves up fresh Ahi or Maguro in Japanese or Salmon.  The flavors are plentiful, and on my first experience to Maguro Spot I got the Spicy Sesame and my girlfriend ate the spicy Ahi.  Both were spectacular!  If there is one thing you should know about Japanese running a business that has to do with fish and rice, ... (well I'm sure it's pretty obvious... but I'll point it out anyway) they take it very seriously.  Rice is the main staple of Japan and if you mess that up, say goodbye to your Japanese customers.  So your base of rice is covered, check that one off the list and know that the one ingredient you weren't even thinking about is already getting umami flavors flowing before you even know it.  OK, lets move on to the Ahi, which is the core of this dish.  My girlfriend pointed out that even the shape and size of the poke was excellent, and not too big.  The freshness of the Maguro really comes out to me when it's put on top of warm rice.  I added avocado because I like that combo, and along with the spicy sesame it was super ONO! (delicious)",
