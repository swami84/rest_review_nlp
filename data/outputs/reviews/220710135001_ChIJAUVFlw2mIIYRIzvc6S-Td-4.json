The service was great. Like some of the best service, especially in New Orleans, that I\u2019ve ever had. They were pretty busy even tho it was only 7ish and our waitress still took her time with every table and was super personable without taking too long with anything! She was so nice and very knowledgeable of the menu.  3. The. Food. I got the Cochon de Lait Cuban sandwich and it was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth! And I\u2019m a total foodie, so I\u2019ve had some good food. My boyfriend got the Andouille crusted chicken sandwich which was so good too. For our app, we got the Cajun fries with the comeback sauce and idk what they did to these regular old French fries but it was just perfect, especially with the sauce.  4. The prices. We were shopping for furniture all day and I was looking up places to eat and we just decided to go there last minute. We weren\u2019t looking for anything super fancy or expensive, but when we got there, we were like oops let\u2019s be prepared to pay a lot. But they had options for anyone and everyone. They had the ambience, service, and quality of food, for a super nice and expensive experience, but there were price options on the menu for just a casual, list minute dinner, which even if I am out for an expensive, thought out dinner, I still like to see those options!  Overall, it was amazing, if you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re debating on going, go. I wish I lived in New Orleans so I could go more often!",

We made a reservation and came back our last night in the French quarter. Are we glad we did. Of course I got more Gumbo. My wife got the Cajun fries with the comback sauce. It will make you comeback.  My wife got the Surf and Turf and I got the Duck Duet. My wife's conche de lait was perfectly smoked. The taste lingered in my mouth all the way until the next bite. I wanted more, but I had duck. His duck was cooked perfectly. They gave me a knife but who needs it. It was fall off the bone tender. I am not sure how he made his cassis reduction, but my wife who hates duck usually, said, \"I don't know what he did with this duck and that sauce, but he needs to keep doing this. That is how you make duck!\"  I thought we were done, but nope, we ordered the pecan not pecan pie with the peanut butter whipped topping. I love Reese's to the point where almost any peanut butter and chocolate tasting dish or treat never compares. This had me wishing I ordered it twice.  This was a fantastic night with plenty of good scenery and of course the out of this world dinner.",

The mushroom caps were not cooked. Ok. The filling texture was a minced type puree and over salted.  The fajita meat was also over salted. The shrimp were good. The fajita sauce tasted like the same crystal hot sauce mayo that we had with the fried chicken on a stick. I like a flour tortilla not corn blended.  The chicken on a stick was unimpressive.

When I tried to ask about it the server went to the menu and the FOH mgr came over and tried to tell me there was no bechamel. I asked if they could please check with the chef as this is an ALLERGY and was blown off. Then the prices on the check were $4-5 MORE compared to the menu.

The server Darrius and manager Maritsa were both wonderful, pleasant and rilled right along with our great time. I had some special requests for family coming in from out of town for Christmas Day. Maritsa made it all happen. Definitely made me feel like a King. Unfortunately the family members that were supposed to come into town for the Holidays had cancelled due to some health issues so I had to cancel these custom reservations, which was very painful to say the least. She put time into making the special request happen. Maritsa handled the conversation like a professional champ and said all the right things to the customer. From somebody who worked in the industry for 12 years, lives in the city, and runs multiple businesses now I can only say that I highly recommend Sobou, the atmosphere, the food, and the staff. The sweet potato beignets rocked too! I will be back with another apology for Maritsa. Merry Christmas.",

The chef (well deserved title) maintains a menu that includes tapas as well as, full plate meals -that are most delicious. The SoBou changes up its design elements to include an area for conversation -which has a few tables with built in beer and wine taps, a nice bar with a television, an area with 8 to 10 tables at street level -which is bright and appears to be \"tuned\" for breakfast as well as, a dining area that is three steps elevated from the street which is designed with the use of intriguing lighting and a wall decoration that is based on infinity object visualization. The wait staff are both pleasant and knowledgeable and their \"follow ups\" are synchronized with the short pauses as the patrons eat their meals. Our favorite contributor was Joshua and at our last night of dining, the General Manager: Lelia stopped by to ensure our visit was at or better than our expectations.  My suggestion: Must visit!",

It's New Orleans style with some fresh ingenuity and creativity.  I had the Poblano soup that was simply over the top delicious.  I asked about the ingredients and the head chef, Darren, showed up at our table to describe his recipe.  I learned he'd chef'd at Commander's Palace, my favorite restaurant in the world, so it wasn't surprising to me he was creating the top-notch cuisine coming out of the kitchen at SoBou.  I was born and raised in Baton Rouge and have eaten at many many restaurants in New Orleans over the years.  SoBou is a standout in my opinion.  And I'm now a big fan of Chef Darren's as well!   Highly recommend.",

The service was okay, a little slow, but otherwise fine. The food is very unique and everything we had was very good, but the portion sizes are very small. I had the Yellowfin Tuna Cones and they were one of the most bizarre things I've ever eaten. Tuna inside an ice cream cone covered with avocado ice cream - surprisingly delicious. I also had the Shrimp Tacos, which were very good, but I was still hungry when we left. Worth going to, but not if you're super hungry.",

The environment is absolutely amazing and the decor has a great effect.  The drinks and the bar area might be worth it, but the dining area was not.  Hostess did not greet us because she was on the phone and it took several minutes for us to be seated to a mostly empty dining room, and then awhile for the waitress to visit our table and we scarcely saw her throughout dinner. We had the duck confit and the duck was dry which isn\u2019t what you want when it\u2019s a $32 dollar plate. The potatoes were amazing though! We wanted dessert but went somewhere else for better service. The bathroom was also dirty and out of toilet paper.",

The night began as we walked in and feasted our eyes upon the beautiful interior decoration of the walls.  We were seated quickly.  Erika was our waitress and she did a fantastic job!  She was efficient, friendly, observant, and had profound knowledge of the menu.  We started with the Small Bites and Cocktails.  The Soup Du Jour and the Gumbo Du Jour inspired us to try more from the Small Bites menu.  One delicious Small Bite led to another and before we knew it, we ordered 75% of the Small Bites menu.  If you\u2019re looking for a unique gustatory delight, I highly recommend The Yellow Fin Tuna Cones. Take a small bite of the ice cream first to avoid brain freeze and then eat the rest.  I imagine it makes for a great palate cleanser prior to the Big Bites because of the citrus flavor from the pineapple ceviche and creaminess of the basil avocado ice cream - kinda like a sorbet.  Though, we never made it to the big bites because we were too full lol!  We tried a number of cocktails and found The Waiting Room as well as The Parakeet Nordine to be our personal favorites.  Even though we left with full tummies, we felt a little empty inside because of how attached we grew to the place in such a short time.  We can\u2019t wait to return for the Big Bites, more cocktails, and dessert!  Thanks again SoBou and Erika for a great experience!",

Now, it wasn't bad brisket, mind. But it tasted like the brisket I've had at Mission BBQ, ie fast food brisket. It was decent, but definitely not worth the price I paid for it. The brisket was all piled on top of a sweet potato. This gave the whole dish an overpowering sweet flavor that detracted from the whole experience. A normal potato would've perhaps been better. Finally, the restaurant is quite dark. My parents both struggled to read the menu from the lack of available lighting, which the staff turned down even further while we were reading through the menu.  Recommendation: Maybe? Don't go there for a holiday meal, unless you really, really want to get mid quality food for higher prices. If you really want to spend $36 on brisket and a potato, go buy some sandwiches and wedge fries from a cheap BBQ place. You'll enjoy it more, and for longer.",

Not to mention the burger is literally just a slider... so it shouldn't have taken that long at all as we all ordered the same thing.  I'm giving it at least two stars though, our waitress was very understanding and even brought our table three shots on the house because of the wait.  then we asked about dessert and unfortunately the bread pudding was going to take 25 more minutes but she said she would check in the back and just heat it up if there was already one made. Luckily there was one made and it should only take 7 minutes... 15 minutes later we finally get it and it does not taste good. All in all I would say there are some very unique things on the menu and it has amazing flavor in the dishes but if you're there on a night where the kitchen might be short-handed... you can get very bad service in the terms of the wait time.  I also do not recommend the burger as it is way too small to be called a burger, it should be called a slider or not listed under the \"Big plates\" section of the menu.  Based on my experience I would never come back here again.  My positives would be that the drinks were phenomenal and our waitress was nice but getting there at 8 p.m. and not being able to leave until 10:20 is absolutely horrendous.",

I had explained why I was ordering the vegetarian options, and there were a couple, and proceeded to order the \"Pecan, not pie\" for dessert. It was described as 'chocolate covered cracklin' & peanut butter whipped cream'.  Unbeknownst to this Canadian, cracklin' is fried pork rinds. Ugh.  Gross.  Found that out as soon as I put it in my mouth.  I switched to my BFs dessert, which was excellent. The food and cocktails were delicious otherwise.

I arrived and was seated quickly, but then left for a long time. After I was given a menu I was convinced to order one of their lunch specials, a 25c martini. I ordered a gin martini. A little while later I ordered my food. Still no gin martini. My first round of food arrived and I asked about my martini. Not even an apology, just a promise to chase it up. My main came along with my martini. This time an apology came and an offer of a free martini that I took up. It came fairly quickly, but was vodka. Then when the bill came I was charged for the complimentary martini. Given the trouble getting the first drink, I didn\u2019t bother arguing about 25c. The food was also really average. Don\u2019t waste your time.",

They had a 3 course meal (drink, appetizer, entree and dessert) for around $30. This food could have easily been $50+ so worth it. The atmosphere of the restuarant is also very cool and it attracts travelers and locals. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",

You almost had me at Hello, but unfortunately the waitress with the multi colored thirsty bob wig that was receding from her hair line sort of ruined for me- oh yes she did.  See there is thing that gets my nerves when dealing with people of color in the work place.  And before you jump crazy with assumptions I\u2019m a chocolate morsel myself.  But getting back to my review- for some reason the line of being down to earth and professionalism is very hazy.  I don\u2019t mind friendly, my God I love a sense of humor- but please - please don\u2019t act as if I\u2019m your ignorant cousin or little brother b/c that opens up a completely different layer of issues with me. I shouldn\u2019t encounter issues where I am getting ready to dine.  Shall we continue to the story at hand.  I walked into So Bou and I was greeted with smiles and (WELCOME TO SO BOU) +++  We were seated where we requested ++  Let\u2019s say this restaurant is beautiful, an absolute gem. There was no smudges or oily fingers, the tables were clean and it smelled very inviting. +++++++  So I was asked what would we like to drink- I prefer a cucumber with water (slices of cucumber with water) and I the waitress replied - eww you\u2019re nasty, but I will fix whatever you would like.  Strike 1  Now So Bou dishes are very small when ordering the small bites, and when I say very small I mean 1 item small and as the waitress said - So Bou believes in quality not quantity. So Bou is like the ratchet version of Commander\u2019s Palace.  Strike 2  You are never to refer to your establishment as ratchet anything especially when it looks like So Bou.  So I asked the hostess about certain dishes and the small bites fried chicken and she told me you only get one and that if I wanted more than I can order the chicken meal which is like $18 and it comes with 4 pieces and I just nodded my head like ok no problem and then these lovely words slipped out of that mouth of hers....  She said.. You know So Bou ain\u2019t like Popeyes, this restaurant is a quality restaurant. You can\u2019t get 4 pieces for $7.99.  When I tell you- I was 3 shakes from telling rainbow dull - what I really felt. Listen. There is nothing wrong with being yourself but monitor who you are b/c sometimes what you\u2019re reaching for in others will come for you. But this is typical from what I have experienced in New Orleans from melanated people..  So moving forward I replied, I don\u2019t eat at Popeyes - so I wouldn\u2019t know.  Her comment was Strike 3.  Was the food good- yes - yes and yes! Instead of rice with gumbo they do it with mash potatoes. That\u2019s a very interesting twist.  Was the waitress knowledgeable about the menu. Yes yes and yes.  Was she attentive and checked on us thoroughly. Yes indeed.  Would I visit So Bou again?  I most definitely will , but I will  not want her as a waitress.  Did she get tipped.. No.  I was insulted too many times.  Did I mentioned that I applauded her on the amount of cucumbers she had placed in my water. Then she mentioned, \u201coh that\u2019s b/c I wouldn\u2019t have to get anymore I can just keep refilling your glasses with water\u201d.  I\u2019m like mmmk thanks.  Would I recommend this restaurant to anyone else? Yes indeed. It\u2019s beautiful- we just had the wrong waitress- that\u2019s all.",

After our final bite of food, a rat comes scampering across the dining room in front of our table to eat scraps discarded on the ground by a table nearby. When we urgently told our waitress, she blandly said \u201cOh... ew\u201d and nonchalantly walked off (no rush) to get the manager. THEN, the manager finally comes over and doesn\u2019t apologize \u2014 instead, he EXCUSES himself for this rodent.  He tells us, \u201cOh yeah, that little guy got in here yesterday and we couldn\u2019t trap him.\u201d WHAT?! EXCUSE ME?! You KNEW the rat was here ALL DAY YESTERDAY, you DIDN\u2019T capture it, and you still allowed food to be prepared and served to customers?! Gross gross nasty YUCK.  The best part? They still MADE US PAY! The waitress dropped off the check, laughed nervously, and said \u201cbye!\u201d before quickly jetting off.  ***DO NOT GO HERE.*** There are plenty of good places in New Orleans that are CLEAN and under GOOD MANAGEMENT.",

We were ignored by the hostess for about 10 minutes when we walked in and that should have been our first clue how brunch would progress. It was 30 minutes before we saw our server after getting our table. We never once got water refills from our waiter, even after asking. After an hour and a half, we managed to get the attention of another waiter who took pity on us and refilled our quite dry water glasses. We got there at 110 and didn\u2019t leave until 345. Most of that time was spent looking at an empty table and water glass. Several table were sat after us, had a three course meal, and left before we even got our main course. I normally cut places slack especially when they\u2019re busy. However when we go there the restaurant was about half full and when we left we were one of three tables. In the entire place. Only two of those three belonged to our waiter. So unless you like unnecessary long neglectful waits with good food, I would not recommend Sobu.",

Had a very friendly waitress but had to ask for water. she also made the bizarre comment that the wine list was indicative and she had no idea what was in the cellar. I don't think it's her fault I think it's the fault of management here. Also arrived 15 minutes before my reservation and despite there being plenty of empty tables, including the one they eventually sat us at we were told our reservation was at 8 PM but we could wait in the bar. We took a stroll around the block instead. Pretentious without needing to be I think. Again, put full blame on the management: if you're going to charge these type of prices you should train your staff up properly.",

The gumbo with its dollop of cajun mashed potatoes combined with the arugula salad were a perfect match. Had a \"Sunset on the Courtyard\" from the cocktail menu and now I'm a customer for life. Bartenders Jared and Josh made the dinner experience topnotch with excellent service. Look forward to going back when in NOLA again.",

So no soup and salad, no ordering apps... there's a very minimal gluten free or vegetarian options as well. I ordered the pancakes and for $30+ they were NOT worth it. So doughy and gluey I sent them back. They came out again and they were just as bad. I do not recommend them. I have never paid so much for pancakes in my life, and I was incredibly disappointed.
