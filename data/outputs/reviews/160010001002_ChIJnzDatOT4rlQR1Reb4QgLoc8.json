Great atmosphere, consistent, and feels like home. Sometimes the temperature on steaks can be a little off, but otherwise top notch. The assistant server \u201cBrenna\u201d (?) is amazing, she is just so personable and to be honest she makes the experience! They knew what they were doing when they hired her. The server Jonathan is top notch, always on his game and incredibly professional. We adore them both and can\u2019t say enough good things about them. So glad we gave them another chance after our first experience, we\u2019ve now been more than a handful of times and always had a great evening. Highly recommend all of the above!",

I read the google review about going home with muffins and tasting peanut butter mashed potatoes (!) The service was impeccable. (Shout out to Jonathan) It was a hard decision because everything sounded so good.  My husband and I ended up getting the same entree, Beef Wellington. Around the time our soup and salad arrived, the live piano music began.  I\u2019ve been to many restaurants where the live music takes over and it\u2019s hard to have a conversation over the music...however, the music volume was perfect.  The whole experience was lovely.  I would definitely recommend it!",

I had the special which was lobster ravioli with a filet. Unbelievable! They are not doing the salad cart but you still pick all of your toppings and they make each salad individually.  The crab dip was so creamy and made with real crab. The cocktails were perfect and the salted Carmel cookie and ice cream dessert was so good! Oh, and they send you off with muffins for the morning! Absolutely amazing! 10 stars!",

We definitely recommend the calamari and the Dungeness crab dip! For main courses, my husband ordered the elk tenderloin, and I had the short ribs. Although the elk portion was absolutely tiny, both dishes were full of complex flavors that mingled together beautifully. The only complaint we had was the mushroom risotto was still VERY crunchy. It was a very busy night there though, so we understand mistakes happen. We'll definitely be back!",

The main reason I chose the Brickyard is for their Beef Wellington which is hard to find anywhere now days. I was taught how to make Beef Wellington at 16, and have loved it ever since. Once we got our main course, that\u2019s when things started to go south. First off, my wife had their seafood dish. The pasta was delicious, the prawns weren\u2019t overcooked, awesome. The scallops on the other hand were way too salty, and the bacon was way under cooked, like chewing on a rubber band. I cut into my beef Wellington and it was raw, not rare, not blue, but raw... (I like my steak medium rare, my wife, she likes her steak rare). I sent it back, which I almost never do. I went to culinary school, and was a Chef for nearly 20 years, and hate being a pain by sending dishes back. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it was way too salty, like punch you in the face salty. When they brought it back, I cut into it, and the meat was still undercooked. Instead I ended up getting a 7oz filet mignon (which I took home, and was just ok), but by then I lost my appetite and just wanted to go home. The saving grace of our whole experience was Matt, he was very professional and polite.",

The Brickyard was MORE than happy to help us, and we had outstanding food in record time.  This restaurant definitely knows the secret to survival during these very difficult business times.  I look forward to dining in, someday in the (hopefully near) future.  The grilled cheese salad will definitely stick in my culinary memory bank!!",

I had to wait 2 days for a day manager, who I got the feeling was really tired and I did not want to deal with it. So the reluctantly credited back an average price for 21 drinks. BUT, this was a party of 26 which means automatic percentage for tip and tax, so I feel the bill was still over charged by about 200 dollars, so enjoy the food and atmosphere but pay very close attention to your tab.

They also have a rolling salad bar where they make your salads right next to the table which is all part of the experience.  They had live piano music playing in the background throughout dinner and it really added to the ambiance of the resteraunt.  They also do dueling pianos which can be a blast. All in all, I would highly recommend the brickyard to anyone looking for a nice evening in downtown Boise",

The food was just ok.. steaks had no flavor and for the price I expected amazing. The choice of potato was a bit off, I was told the truffle fries were amazing but not sure where the truffle was. It was not on the fries. As a matter of fact there was nothing on my fries. The food was less compared to the long horn, but we wanted chandlers. We waited over two hours for our food to come out. Yes over two hours. Some of us in our party ordered dessert which took another 30-40 min for a cookie and a cobbler.  Some got the mash potato and they again were just ok. The restaurant was not overly packed and could not find a reason why food took so long but I don\u2019t think time should alter the flavor of the food. This was our Christmas Eve experience and by the accounts and the other reviews I would say we experienced what others have as well with the price of food to quality of food. It\u2019s a nice place to sit in and the servers are pleasant but the food was not equal to the price and to us was really just ehhh ok!",

I had crab dip w/ bread it wasn't anything extraordinary. The baked brie was alright it did come with more fruit than I expected! Tbh the two cocktails I had were TERRIBLE. Don't get me wrong they were strong  I could taste the Vodka. One of the cocktails (can't recall the name) tasted like Pez. The 10 oz steak was good and my husband loved his elk. BUT the salad was SO SMALL if that is going to be one of my sides you'd think it would be larger and it was limp romaine lettuce it wasn't spring mix. And the other sides are all potatoes which are quite cheap and they didn't taste good (we had mashed, and au gratin). The service was fantastic very attentive and kind waiter, very conversational and attentive. They do give you sorbet to \"cleanse your palette\" which is neat but the food isn't terrible it is I would say a little above average but not worth $200 for dinner.",

I had a manhattan, onion soup, truffle fries and a ribeye with demi glace added. So lets start with the drink... my bartender, Matt fixed my manhattan as special ordered. Ignore the drink menu as they have liquor brands not mentioned. Then the soup arrived. I can honestly say it is the first cup of onion soup that I have finished in YEARS. Wonderful veal stock with the perfect amount of sweetness from the onions, which I suspect are vidalias. The steak then arrived that was so perfectly  flavorful and juicy. Hats off to the 5 star brickyard. I will be back.",

The staff was very nice, the woman who made my tableside salad was so kind when I had no clue what was going on as well. Steak was cooked perfectly and my mashed potatoes were so creamy and delicious (NEED that recipe!). Plus the best part is that it was an inexpensive-expensive dinner. Going to Vic Stewart's Steakhouse we spent over $120 dollars (if memory serves me right), here at The Brickyard, it was around $85 or $90 including the tip! We had our soup and salad, a palette cleanser of lemon sorbet before the main event of steak, mashed potatoes, and vegetables. Then with my meal, it included a dessert (I chose the huckleberry cobbler). 10/10 would definitely go again for a night out on the town.",

The water/bread server was inept, and extremely rude (he even volunteered his political opinion to us in an attempt at a backhanded insult).  I thought it was odd for a low level server to have an attitude. Then, we met the frontend manager, and it all made sense.  This place has serious top down problems, and it's reflected in the quality service.  To go on, we had reservations, and were sat next to the bathroom.  We did switch tables when a better one became available.  The staff failed to clean our new table, and then sat our silverware on the dirty surface.  The bread wasn't brought to out table till we had been there an hour.  The server didn't bring bread plates, and opted to just toss the bread on our entree plates (entree arrived before the bread...).  The food was okay, but for the money I had higher expectations.  One of our entrees was overdone, and burnt.  Really, an item shouldn't be on the menu if it can't be prepared properly.  There were issues with the drinks as well.  Most bartenders can mix a dirty martini w/o special instructions, not at the Brickyard apparently.  I could go on, but hopefully this is enough to give people an idea of what to expect.  I don't recommend the Brickyard, especially if you're trying to celebrate a special occasion. I won't be returning unless I really want to ruin a night out.",

The 1st time, my steak was amazing, the service was amazing (blonde woman with a \"jalapeno\" tattooed on her throat \ud83d\ude0b). Unfortunately the second time was awful, and I will not be going back. The main problem was the food, I ordered a fillet mignon, medium rare, not only did it take forever to come out (apparently they can't have a large party, and a full dining room and deliver decent service). When my food finally call out, my steak was cold, tough, and dry. When the waiter came by to check, I explained. He sent the manager over, who didn't say two words except \"pardon my reach\" to my husband, grabbed my steak with tongs, squeezed it, put it back on my plate, and said he'd go take care of it. I thought I would get a new properly cooked fillet, because clearly mine was not cooked right. If a medium rare fillet mignon is not buttery, \"melt in your mouth\" it wasn't cooked correct. All I got back was the same steak heated up. It was almost impossible to even cut the steak. Very disappointed. And I won't even mention desert.... Will not be going back, I'll spend $43 on a properly cooked fillet somewhere else!!!",

The ribeye was probably the best I've tasted. It had a very flavorful buttery taste to it. The meat was tender. Nice presentation served on a mound of sauteed mushrooms, asparagus spears and organic carrots. Scalloped potatoes were different. It looked like tiramisu when they first brought it out. Soup was also very good. Service was perfect. They didn't aggravate me and would check on me when my beverage was low otherwise only to bring the food. They provided a small sorbet to cleanse the palate between the starters and the main course. I'll be back for sure.",

My rib-eye steak was grisly, lukewarm and the sides were cold. My Wife's rib-eye was OK, but not on par. The table-side salad service was clever and our waiter was cordial. After downing our Cabernet, both while waiting for our tardy dinners and afterwards, we settled for comping my dinner. As my Wife lost her appetite by then and I don't like eating alone and after the fact, we just went home...sans a desert celebration! Obviously, the Brickyard's kitchen and wait-staff had a problem, at least with our meal, last night. Having dined at some of the finest steakhouses across the country and based on the billing this restaurant proffers, offering a do-over or comp, doesn't bode well for cultivating repeat customers.",

Dessert is extra but also fantastic. The wine list is a little thin and a bit expensive but there are some surprisingly good Idaho wines especially the Cabs. Didnt see any parking close by. But restaurant on a corner of Main and 6th so easy to find. By the way, on weekend nights they have dueling pianos! Make a reservation and enjoy.",

Well, it was a huge surprise for me as my maids of honors had reservations at a specific time that was confirmed with an employee here. When we entered inside the restaurant we had multiple servers questioning our reservations & that they we not aware of it. They seemed a little annoyed about it, as if we were bombarding/invading there convenience. They made the room for our reservation set up for our event after waiting by the bar for a few minutes, it was a little awkward. We had ordered a steak and salmon. Well let me just tell you about how fine cooking this entree was... the steak was supposed to be medium/well done & as I was cutting through the steak nothing but blood was gushing out of the meat. It was disgusting. We had our waitress take it back to cook it to where there was only supposed to be a little pink inside & when they brought it back it was still bleeding a lot & the pink was still pretty raw, after already asking to take the steak back to cook it to how it's initially supposed to be we didn't eat anymore of it. I only had taken two bites from this steak & the taste was so blan it reminded me of hamburger helper meat! Horrible quality! The asparagus was also so under cooked, and I cook asparagus at my house it was way too raw! The salmon was so raw too, the girls only ate the outside of the meat that was reasonably cooked, it was poorly cooked!!! At the end of this the waitress seemed passive aggressive with us and honestly it wasn't professional at all. I'm sorry but I would not recommend this place to ANYONE! I will be telling all of my friends, family, and employees about this place! Horrible quality, Horrible service!",

The servers were great from the get go, checking in with our first initial orders but then we got 30 minutes in and our server told us the wait time for their salad preparer was going to be a bit, we ended up sitting there an hour and a half before we saw our main course. I understand having multi-course meals it can take some time for meals to arrive but having to wait for our food to be fired until we had our salad unacceptable. BUT Brickyard did a wonderful job at making sure they made up for that! They took care of our meal and went beyond that! I deeply appreciate the fact that they made sure we\u2019d return for a better experience. As a supervisor of a restaurant myself I expect the best of not only our restaurant but of others of equal or more quality! Thank you for taking better care of us!

We took 2 hours to leisurely go through our drinks and food. A couple of house martinis to start. Then We went with delicious crab cakes, then the mac and cheese (my wife said, \"This is the best I've ever had!\"), a brickyard burger....amazing, truffle fries and ice cream for desert. Rene was our server and he was fabulous. Patient, friendly, not imposing. We had the place to ourselves the last hour. We will definitely go here again.",

They came to us medium well, borderline well done. Upon informing our waiter he offered to have new steaks cooked for us. We accepted. Then some lady showed up and said we would get a drink comped for our troubles. When the new steaks arrived hers was medium and mine was rare. Obviously the head chef was not in the kitchen and whomever was cooking these steaks really had no idea what he was doing. I won't be returning to the Brickyard.

I've taught myself to seek out the places that are just \"a little more crowded\" than the places that are secluded and quiet. There is something about a certain amount of buzz in the air that makes a meals alone, a little bit more entertaining. So that's why I've found myself here. I've been to the Eagle, ID location and now this one in downtown Boise. I find this one just a very little bit better. Eagle is much more suburban almost rural and the crowd is a little more,how shall I say \"passed young\"... But so am I. The food is pretty good and normal American fare type stuff. Great selection of beer, booze, and wine. The one thing I don't \"get\" in this location is the high/low table set up. It's awkward at best as most of the high tables get really larger groups who squeeze in tight, college crowds and alike. The elevated stools reduce the \"ass to head\" distance when a low table is wedged in between two high tables. It's just not right at some level...get it \"level\" Don't get me wrong. These are good places and I always enjoy my time here... Depending which way I face!",

Chicken fried steak very dry without gravy, but when we asked for the gravy, we had to wait for them to cook it. No reasoning there, folks should not have had to ask or wait for gravy. In regards to reservation, table next to us was empty the whole time we were there, hostess could have set us in the table with chairs. My grandchildren had to go under the table to get in and out.  We were set up against the long sofa, so getting in and out was impossible for half our party. For gratuity that is mandatory for a party of 10 or more, the waiter did  not remove empty dishes, fill empty water glasses, we had to ask for spoons, 10% gratuity would have been warranted not 20% for service not given! Mother's day brunch is very special to my wife with our children and grandchildren, based on today's brunch, we will not be returning!",

Then the fantastic salad that is made fresh at your table and next came the perfectly cooked Kobe steak and veggies. We finished off with a cup of coffee and cookie sundae. Service and food were great! And with the lovely piano music it was a fantastic setting and evening. I definitely recommend this place to everyone!

We had a reservation a month in advance.  Immediately when we arrived we were \"sized up\" by the host (manager?), after much writing he handed the hostess a slip of paper and we were seated.  Out of the abundance of tables available in the establishment, we were taken to the table by the \"traffic door\" where the workers come and go and of course one has easy access to the bathrooms.  I asked the hostess if we could have a different table and she replied that she would have to talk with the manager as he had everything \"configured\" just right; needless to say, we were never given a different table.  Had it not been Valentines Day we would of left in a heartbeat but figured other restaurants would be booked so we chose to stay.  There were at least 3 tables that never filled while we were there.  My husband was in dress slacks/dress shirt and I was in a fitted LBD; people seated after us were in jeans so I don't believe it was an \"attire\" issue.  When one is paying $40 for a steak, they don't want to have butt's shoved in their faces because their packed in so closely to the next table and delivery door that the workers can't help but bump into them.  Though our waitress and other employees that helped with service once we were seated were wonderful, being sized up at the beginning and given the worse table in the establishment without reconsideration has left us vowing never to return to this establishment.",
