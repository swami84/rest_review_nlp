It was extremely watered down almost to a point of a soup. Tikka Masala should not be in a soup form, period, it should not be watered down.  Very disappointed, can't say I will ever return.

I opted for pickup and the host was friend fast to take my and my friend's orders. The take out deal is by far the best option on the menu, as you get an appetizer, an entree, rice, naan, and side sauces/chutneys all for $15! The chicken makhani I ordered came LOADED with meat and it was perfectly spiced to my request. The chicken tikka appetizer I ordered had so much meat it was almost it's own meal! (They always have generous portions but this time they really outdid themselves!). My friend ordered the chicken tikka masala with vegetable pakora as his appetizer and a mango lassi for a drink and everything was delicious! My ONE negative about this place is that the naan is pretty much always slightly undercooked and doughy. This isn't a problem when I can pop it in the toaster oven at home but we decided to eat a picnic lunch and I would have liked some of the naans I ordered to have been a little less raw. (It wasn't terrible but it would have been nicer if it were more cooked.) While I have not eaten in the restaurant, I saw another customer dining in while there and his portions were also very large and the service he was getting was great! I think because of their great deal this spot mostly gets takeout and delivery business but don't be dissuaded if it looks not too busy inside because it's a nice, clean, comfortable restaurant on the inside with attentive waiters and staff and the food is fantastic! DEFINITELY GET FOOD FROM HERE! :)  The photo shows our spread of food - after digging in a little so PORTIONS ARE LARGER THAN THIS! Giant appetizer dishes, giant portions of meat, and decent naan (this piece was a little raw but it was still good).",

I have to take a star off because, yes, their food can be expensive. I ordered an appetizer that was 6 pieces of cauliflower for $8 or $9 (it was delicious, but come on, my Indian friends says it's cheap street food in India :/ ). Anyway this is why Aangan is great -- DELIVERY! Specifically, their dinner special. For ~$20 delivered, you get  an appetizer, a main dish, a large piece of naan and a take-out box of rice. I recommend the samosas for appetizer (i know, basic but they are delicious), and I recommend the Lamb Saagwala or Chicken Tikka for your main! Enough food for 2 moderately hungry people (or stuff 2-3 hungry people by ordering 2 specials :D ). Anyway, they are super fast at delivery and the delivery guy is really nice. The point is, if you just look at this restaurant as a place to get a great delivery special, then it's a solid 4.5!",

When we asked about a good Indian restaurant in his neighborhood, this is where he recommended.  The interior is kept rather simple, with very light pastel blue and mocha color. Since the wall on the street side had large windows from floor to ceiling, it had plenty of natural lights.  They have a really great lunch special menu, Lunch Platter, and comes in three variations; Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, and Seafood. They all come with bastami rice, naan, pickle & salad, dal makhani, vegetable of the day, and raita. On top of that, we get to have a choice of appetizer, another entr\u00e9e, and a choice of dessert. Food was tasty but more of A-OK, I would give 3.5 stars if we were allowed to give half stars.  The service was very slow but we were not in rush at all, so we had a nice, relaxing lunch here. The value of the lunch platter is really good for the amount we received. Even thought the portion of some dishes in the bowls were very small, but all together, with naan, we got really full at the end of the meal. This is a great way to try a little taste of so many different Indian dishes, at a very affordable price. Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog, foodlovergirl.",

We ordered Chicken Korma and Lamb Saag.  The lamb saag sauce was really delicious, but the meat was inedible.  I am not sure I can even call it meat, because out of the 9 or so meat-like chunks, only 1 was actually meat, the other 8 were solid bone or just plain fat.  It was truly one of the worst food experiences at any New York restaurant that I've had.  My husband's Chicken Korma was slightly better, but the meat quality of the boneless chicken was still pretty terrible.  He could only eat 4 or 5 of the pieces that weren't solid fat and gristle.  The mango lassi that I ordered ended up being the only thing I could have.  In addition, I was furious at myself, because the order was over $50, so basically I paid $50 for 2 inedible dishes, 2 mango lassis and some mediocre naan bread.  I will never order from them again.",

The lamb vindaloo was very badly spiced, completely covering up the taste of the lamb and giving a really unpleasant flavor. The rice that accompanied the dish, despite looking like it was supposed to be a pilaf of some kind, had no flavor at all, and had the consistency of leftover rice heated up in the microwave. Perhaps most distressing was that, despite the fact that vindaloo is (or at least ought to be) made with vinegar, making a vindaloo sit well in one's stomach, I still felt quite ill after eating this food. Given the high number of Indian restaurants in the neighborhood, which are far more reasonably priced than this one, I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend.",

There is a spice that tastes like mint and lemon mixed that I have been searching for.  I had it once at a place in St. Paul, MN and then again in Washington, DC.  However, each time I was so enthralled with the food that I forgot to ask what was the spice.  The point of that tangent is that I asked our waiter for suggestions relating to this spice.  He thought for a moment and then suggested a dish that he highly recommended.  Unfortunately, it was not the spice for which I was looking.  Fortunately, the dish he suggested was excellent.  I felt bad that his guess was not correct, so I came back the following day to try again.  The waiter remembered me and made another suggestion.  Again, it was not the spice but it was also excellent.  Perhaps I am biased since I love Indian cuisine, but that waiter cared so much about making the correct choice that it really moved me, which is surprising in and of itself.  Regardless, I ate at this restaurant twice and I intend to return the next time I am in NYC.  The prices were reasonable and the service was excellent, not to mention the nice view of Broadway.",
