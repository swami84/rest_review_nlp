My husband and I went there on a rainy afternoon and we asked for a glass of hot water. They removed the existing glasses of water from the table and brought Boiling water in small espresso cups! They neither bothered to keep cold water for mixing nor refilled \u201cthe espresso cups\u201d until we finished our meal and left! We ordered \u201cAloo chickpea tikki\u201d and Vegetable Biryani; the Aloo tikki was almost black in color with raw tamarind paste on top instead of the date chutney and tasted so bad that we ate without a word. The biryani was a total shock: for the $18 we paid, we got a small cup of biryani with undercooked  vegetables (the serving vessel was a small cup that held 3/4 cup of rice and vegetables all together); Nobody wants broccoli in the biryani!! We left with the unfinished meal and paid $35 for nothing!! Absolutely worst Indian food we had ever tasted and would never return!! Don\u2019t go here unless you want to just look at the food and leave with a hefty check!",

Salmon was a winner with charred outside and fall apart tender inside. Also Dal makhani was one of the best though it wasnt the main dish. Malvani chicken ..the name was more authentic than the dish...however we enjoyed the fact that we had Malvanini dish in Washington DC. To end the lunch was sweet platter which had gulabjam. Rabadi, kheer and gajar halwa..which was nice and sweet. The restraurant is chic, is in middle of DC, elegant ambiance and definitely on costlier side.",

Management is so rude and are anti- kids and anti-Indians. Although the serving staff is good, managers attitude is very bad. I didnt wanted my 15 month old son to play with forks and knives, so I hide them beneath the chair. The manager came and took them away with the look as if I was trying to steal them. Such a disrespect to the customers!! They need to learn the first rule of Service before getting into service Business. These guys think having Indians in their restaurant will make the place bad. Manager would continously give us a look as if we dont belong there. Never checked with us about how we like it or not..but I see him cheking with other white people.  Although the food was kind of ok, I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you are ready for some serious humilation!",

The staff have an air of superiority and typically look down up on you (Especially if you are Indian) We were tourists looking for a good meal and agree, that we may have been under dressed (shirts and walking shorts, wearing tennis shoes) for the place. First they made us wait for approx 20 min when the table they eventually gave us, was free and ready all the while. In fact, the restaurant was only half full. I guess I should have understood the signal for us to leave. Then we ordered our food and waited a while for the food to arrive in installments. For an upscale place they really don't understand the idea of serving the entire order at the same time. I would have overlooked all these problems if only the food was any good. The chef needs to understand that taste of Indian food is simply not proportional to the volume of spices you use. The entrees were heaped in spices so much that I could hardly taste the ingredients any more. The only things that tasted good was the lemon cashew rice we ordered as sides. we had to order more of these since the rest of the entrees were not necessarily tasty. To top it all off, the waiter, when he presented the check was smart enough to explicitly remind me that I need to put a gratuity when I sign my check. Were you expecting me to not tip you? Save yourself some time and money. Drop this place from your lunch or dinner plans.",

The staff was friendly but there was a serious push to rush for the order since kitchen was closing at 230 pm which is quite understandable but was little too overwhelming and unnecessary I felt. I am coming here after 4 years since I had a very good recollection of the past but I was quite disappointed for the following reason - 1) The portions of the dishes are so small that I find the price to be a rip. off , it was half the size that you get in any good Indian restaurant that has a price range of $ 14 to $ 18 per Sabzee / Item. 2) The Butter nans were not served hot ? 3)  Even if you order onions which is usually served as a complimentary) they charged a $ 4 extra for giving onions on the side . 3) We ordered Dal Makhini , which I felt was hurriedly made and lacked the essence of its normal taste . 4) We ordered vegetable Tawa - please dont order this - its horrible and is useless 5) Also with all this we had to pay a gratuity of 20 % on the bill - and my entire bill came around $ 180 , which I felt was totally unnecessary. I will not recommend this any more , before this trip this restaurant used to be my natural choice to friends but not anymore",

My family has been coming to this place for years and today our young children were refused food which we had brought for them since they can be picky eaters. We have done this in the past without any hassles. But today, we were curtly informed that what's happened before does not matter and that the restaurant could help dispose of our childrens' food if we would like. The manager also subtly threatened us by implying that he was speaking with us nicely and that his tone could change if we did not cooperate. We asked him to charge us for the kids at which he replied they don't charge for young kids and that we could not pay him enough to allow our kids to eat their food inside the premises. At this mention, we simply paid and left the premises. The only person apologetic was the server who hesitated to even bring us our check. Why blame the uncouth manager, even the owner of this chain Mr. Ashok Bajaj is rude, unapologetic and misbehaves with his customers? We had a bad experience with him at  Bindass. I can assure him that not a single individual my family knows is not getting a referral to visit his chain of restaurants. As a parent and a self respecting Indian American, when there is a bias against my children and my culture, it will be fought tooth and nail.",

Though it is an Indian restaurant yet they are biased with people of their own country. True shame!!! Having a restaurant in Washington DC doesn't mean you are white! When we reached they gave a look as we had a baby so they were worried that it will affect their white crowd. On top of that they did not have high chairs for babies to sit in. Probably the only restaurant I've seen which doesn't have high chairs. This is their trick to avoid crowd with small babies. We went because we heard they have good food. But food wasn't good. Quantity of food was for kids. Baby portion for $18 for vegetable biryani , in a bloody soup bowl! The person who was serving us food ,I called him twice for something ,he ignored after looking at me.At the same time there are white people sitting adjacent to us, he was really nice to them all the time. If you check the reviews around here, look at the ones made by Indians & not the Indians. You'll find a pattern sufficient enough to decide if you wish to visit this restaurant of colonial vibes. FOR RESTAURANT : GIVE RESPECT TO PEOPLE OF YOUR OWN COUNTRY !!!LEARN EQUALITY!!!",
