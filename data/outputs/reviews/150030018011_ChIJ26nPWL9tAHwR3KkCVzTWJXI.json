Honestly, the owners are some of the most Genuine people I've met in my life. I ate there one night with my wife, the next night I brought my entire family of 4 kids. The food is great, the hands that prepare it pour love and intention into their craft and your soul. To me the pricing was way to reasonable for the ensemble of food they gave but they wouldn't accept more.  I read an unfortunate comment in the reviews where a gentleman didn't get his chicken plate. I'm sorry to hear that. When we went I just asked the chef to give me whatever he wanted to make, and embraced the creativity in the moment of the owner chef. In my experience when you visit an artisan shop like this they only use the freshest ingredients and don't refrigerate stock of foods for weeks. The menus change within minutes to maintain only the freshest ingredients for dishes. They get food daily and bake pita daily so I encourage everyone to enjoy the best of what's available in the moment.  All in all, I love this place and anytime I'm in Waikiki this is my spot!",
