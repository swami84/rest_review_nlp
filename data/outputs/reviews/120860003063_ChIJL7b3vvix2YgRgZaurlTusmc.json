I ordered directly from them and the young lady told me that the driver would scan my card. When he arrived, he told me his machine wasn't working so I called the restaurant.  While I'm on the phone with the young lady from the restaurant, he knocks on the door again, hands me his phone and a man on the other end asks me for my credit card. I said absolutely not and closed the door. The young lady took my credit card and all was good except that I told her about the driver and she didn't give it much importance. A few minutes later, he knocks again and has the audacity to ask me if I left him a tip.  I'll never order directly from them again.  From now on, only through Grubhub.",

Delivery is quick, no matter if it's raining or storming cats and dogs. LOL they have good pricing, and very friendly friendly customer service. The owner may seem a little odd, but his intentions are well, he works very hard, and the kitchen, and may stick his head out sometimes, just to make sure all customers, are treated equally. But as far as the Oriental man, and the Latin girl, that works in the front taking orders and giving you, you're delicious food to take home, they're wonderful, very happy people, always smiling. There are also four tables, small two chairs, each where you can eat in. You are in the 125th Street Plaza Shopping Center so keep your eyes, and ears open. There is a lot of traffic flow in that parking lot, good and bad. Some business, and some drug-related. But like all cities, it seems, like sometimes we can find some of the best, take out food especially, Chinese, Italian, please do not forget small children in your car. Did not leave them alone, unattended. The sun in Florida especially South Miami is very unforgivable. Please lock doors and windows. Please do not leave any, valuables, in the car, especially visible. There is no need, to walk around with thousands of dollars, of jewelry, on your personal self. That is what, attracts criminals, and can bring danger, to yourself, to your family, and to whatever, location business you are visiting. Always keep that in mind. My goal is not only to guide people, too wonderful, and safe locations. But it is also to keep you aware, of where you are. I like to receive reviews, and feedback, and questions. So I am always available, look me up David Lawrence a Google local guides. I will answer any questions, give advice to the best of my ability, and always be there, to make your dining, and purchasing, of appliances, Furniture, automobiles, Auto Parts, clothing, I covered just about everything. I'm not just a local food guy guide. I'm originally, a New Yorker, but I consider myself now a Floridian. Grew up in Miami Shores, North Miami area. So I know this city of North Miami, like the back of my hand. Trust in me, to give you the truth, good and bad, as it may be. On my reviews, when it comes to places, that you might want to go visit. I don't beat around the bush. I am very kind, even if I don't like places, that I go to. If I see only two things that are good, I will mention it, but at the same time, if I see the horrible things, I am not scared, and I'm more willing to share that to all of my followers. And people that are just, joining me, to a better experience in North Miami, and also surrounding cities. I can help you guide, also in Fort Lauderdale, South Miami, Miami Beach, South Miami Beach. South Beach. So once again I am here. With open arms. I love what I do,. I hope one day, to take this to the next level. With Google. I would love to become, a local guide, in physical and personal form. It is something that I am, talking to my family, about for advice, and ideas. I think I found, my place in life. I have a beautiful family, and have a lot of love, from my two children, and Neighbors. I've been living in the same house, for 35 years. I've seen the best, of the city of North Miami, and I've come to see the worst, but there still is good in the city of North Miami. That's why, I have not lost faith, or sold my property, and moved to a other location. My goal is to better the city of North Miami, there is an element, that has moved into North Miami, that is trying to tear apart, my great city of North Miami. I refuse to allow this to happen, and we'll fight back, in a friendly, and loving wait. To protect, my memories and thoughts. Of growing up here in the city of North Miami. I am now a father, and a raising several beautiful children of my own, here in the city. It's sad though that I have to have them homeschooling, because the public schools have been overrun, bye and I'm going to try to be friendly here by unorganized,",
