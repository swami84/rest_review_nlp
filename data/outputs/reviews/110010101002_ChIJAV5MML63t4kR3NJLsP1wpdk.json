But the front says that there is no udong soup before they already put in all toppings. So we just put in soy sauce. But the noodle didn't well cooked. My kids say she can't eat anymore. Futhermore, the staff asked us to leave in 10 min to close the restaurant. If they want to close on time, they should not have our order.  I ordered traditional bibimbap.

They have an interesting way for you to order your food. You can choose from 3 types of bases (rice, noodles, or gluten free). These are reflected by the 3 different pieces of paper you order from. From there you choose your additional toppings like assorted veggies, proteins, sauces, and anything extra. Then you hand them your paper and they grab everything you ordered together.  Since this was our first time, we had lots of questions on what tastes good, what doesn't and how things looked. They were super nice and patient with us. They gave us very good recommendations I ordered the spicy chicken protein with udon noodles and some additional toppings. This was delicious so if you're looking for something good, try the udon noodles and spicy chicken! I've heard the bulgogi was good too.  Also a chill ambiance to eat at if you'd like to. Would 100% recommend!",

As you walk in, you'll grab a colored piece of paper (bulgogi, noodles, or gluten free option) and you start to build your order. Don't worry if you can't decide. They have a full menu of their own creations if you don't want to make your own.  Once you give them your paper, it only take 45-60 seconds for them to make your lunch. You pay, grab a free mint as you go, and grab a craft soda or a fresh brewed Honest Tea. Don't miss the spicy sauce section as you exit.  Enjoy!",

Rice Bar's services works similarly to other fast casual service-line restaurants, such as Chipotle; you start with an order slip that you check off what you'd like, you hand it to one of the employees, and your order is put together and moved down the line while you watch the action. It can be a little overwhelming putting together your order at first, especially if you aren't familiar with typical Korean fare, but the staff is super helpful with explanations and recommendations. Service is super quick; even with a line out the door I've never waited more than about 10-15 minutes to get my order. The food is also very reasonably priced; expect to spend around 10 bucks, depending on what you order, and the portions have always been enough to completely fill me up, and I usually eat A LOT. I just wish there was a bit more seating available, as I also really like the restaurant's decor and wouldn't mind eating my lunch there, but the place is already filled to brim with tables and chairs, so it's not like this is something that could really be changed at this location. There are a few tables outside, which is great, but be wary of trying to find a seat here during peak lunch hours. Regardless, Rice Bar is still fantastic and I'm already looking forward to my next meal here!",
