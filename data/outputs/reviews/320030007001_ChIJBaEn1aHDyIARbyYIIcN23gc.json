The staff was friendly and attentive and the chefs were friendly. The issue for me was the quality of the ingredients. Also it was (to me) very overpriced. Typically I pay between 1.75 and 2 bucks for a piece of tuna nigiri. Here it was 10 bucks for 2 tiny pieces. Next the nigiri tasted like chemicals and the fried rice was flat and bland. Sorry for the review but I think the quality of ingredients was subpar.",

( I've never had soggy karage) that's not karage lol. I guess they were going for some asaian fusion type of deal but..... And I'm not sure how you can get a crunch roll wrong but they managed to do that as well. It's literally a piece of shrimp with rice and no avocado or cucumber. They they put too much eel sauce to makes it too sweet.  I don't know who's running the show but I suggest a total menu over haul.",
