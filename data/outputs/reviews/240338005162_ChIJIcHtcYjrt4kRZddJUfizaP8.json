They are not friendly, very rude and customer service truly eludes them.  I would not complain if they only ran out of food once, but most times when we go and we go at least once a week, they are out of Jerk Chicken and/or Sweet Potatoes.  In addition, they advertise White Meat Chicken and they don't sell it.  They are so undependable that a couple of months ago, they were closed for weeks and there was no sign, no message on the phone and no one near their location had any idea when or if they would re-open.   They are embarrassingly bad and the Vendors near their location also complain.  When I went in today, an hour before closing, again, they had no Jerk Chicken so I asked to speak to the Chef.  Chef Gayle finally came out and said that he would not be making any more chicken because he does not have anymore chicken.  So, how long does it take for a business to realize that they don't have the proper quantity of product and need to better plan and prepare to not continuously inconvenience their customers?  Today, tired of this constant issue, I asked to speak to the Owner and neither Daniel, Server/Cashier or Chef Gayle, the Cook had a way to reach the Owner--imagine that!  THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!  Go somewhere else.",
