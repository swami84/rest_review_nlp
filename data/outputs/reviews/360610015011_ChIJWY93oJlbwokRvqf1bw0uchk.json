The service is fantastic: prompt, friendly and very knowledgeable about their menu. Food is fantastic. Typically bruschetta is a standard appetizer that is hard to mess up but also is hard to make it stand out. I don\u2019t know how but they elevated this bruschetta to a must have item. The scallop appetizers were also incredible, perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth like butter. I had the the truffle pasta and they were not stingy on the amount of truffle used which was surprising for the affordable price. The salmon was a big hit amongst my coworkers as well as the lamb. I can\u2019t recommend this restaurant enough.",

But it wasn\u2019t just about the food, everything about this place is unique and one of a kind. It\u2019s about the size of a living room and very cozy. The minute you walk in, you immersed in the friendly family-like atmosphere. The setting and decor makes you feel right at home. Ruth, our waitress was smart and funny, not to mention very helpful, informative and provided impeccable service. Thank you, guys, for the wonderful evening! We will be definitely coming back!",

Staff and owner are full of enthusiasm and offer great customer service to their patrons. The food is is done well and portion size are good. We had a bruschetta to share which was full of perfectly rip cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella (which is fantastic) and a drizzle of olive oil. Definitely recommended! For mains we had Rigatoni Al Cinghiale with wild boar and Spaghetti Neri Alle Vongole. The Rigatoni was a touch el-dante for me but still a magnificent meal. The Spaghetti was a perfect seafood dish with a hint of chili heat. Because it is a small restaurant to maximize space there is a communal counter table in the centre of the floor and wall mounted tabletop along the wall. Would I recommend Sola Lab ... Absolutely. It is great value for money for a great dining experience.  * Day and time of day attended restaurant: Saturday evening * Get down: * Address: 45 Beekman Street * Prices: $$ out of $$$$ * Web site: no website (currently) * How many people were there? The restaurant had constant traffic and was always about 80% full. * Was the meal adequately hot or cold? Yes * Did it seem fresh? Absolutely * Anything unusual? At the end of the evening we were given a gift of fresh pasta - we though it was a really nice touch by the restaurant. * Did they pay attention to aesthetics (color, layout, etc.)? Yes, the decor was well thought out and laid out. * Aroma? The kitchen is right by the dining area and door are kept open, so you get lovely kitchen aromas in the dining room. * What were the prices? Sola Lab offers great value for money. Mains range from $14 to around $30 (the \u2018TODAY\u2019 part of the menu is a little more expensive). * Service: * Were they helpful? Yes * Did they rush you? No * Did they deliver the food to the right people? Yes * Were they knowledgeable? Yes * Problems? Mmmm - the wall table is mounted a little to high not a huge issue really but may be inconvenient if you are short. * If you want a glass of wine, you should be aware that their liquor license is still pending - recommend calling ahead to see if that\u2019s been sorted. If still pending you can bring your own bottle.",
