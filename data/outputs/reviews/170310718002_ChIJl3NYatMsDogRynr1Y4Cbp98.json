To make things worse after I sent it back  3 different mgrs/owners came to my table 3 different times with no apology or offer of correction they instead wanted to advise/convince me they just grab any legs out the box although again my date and customers next to me had normal size legs.

        "caption": "I ordered the buy one get one lent special King Crab for $56. It was my husband\u2019s birthday dinner. Due to the stay in place order we took it as take out. Very disappointed once we got the two orders of King Crab not only did the all the crab fit in one styrofoam dinner to go box but the claws had been removed. Thankfully the \u201c two\u201d orders were enough for my husband and I just skipped the crab and let him enjoy it . If I hadn\u2019t ordered two orders my husband would\u2019ve been very disappointed and hungry. I\u2019m still wondering what happened to the claws ? The butter was very bland and unsalted, overall it was not a great meal but it made my husband happy because he truly loves crab.  I just got my grub hub charge and the advertised Price on their website of $56 , that I confirmed with the person I spoke to when I initially called to order the buy one get was  $66 and for some reason I was charged  almost $30 for a pound of mussels in a bag. That\u2019s also advertised on their website as being $19.95 Ridiculous price, almost $100 for a Styrofoam dinner holder with clawless crab that was allegedly two full orders and 1 pound of mussels in a bag with two very thin slices of sausage,  two pieces of corn and four pieces of potatoes not a deal. GrubHub didn\u2019t cost me anything for delivery because I had my daughter pick it up as  they wouldn\u2019t accept my card payment over the phone, since my daughter was in the area and didn\u2019t have a card they suggested we use Grubhub to place the order,  pay for it and she could just pick it up without ever mentioning that some how the prices on Grubhub are not remotely close to the prices they have advertised on their website. My daughter was kind enough to order for me on her Grubhub and she not knowing the prices on grubHub were different,  assumed I was aware of the price.. I was hoping to do my part by ordering out  as I know many restaurants are struggling but switching prices at the last minute is not the way to make ends meet needless to say I will not be patronizing this business again and I suggest you check their website and GrubHub before you order anything",

My mom and I ordered a seafood boil and we were so excited we thought we were going to be blown away, but we weren\u2019t. The corn wasn\u2019t cooked all the way. And there were only 2 sausages. There were only 5 to 6 potatoes in the bag, and there was no broccoli in either. The crab legs tasted good, but it was cold like 3 minutes after it was served. The sauce was good though. I\u2019ll give them that. I believe we paid like 60 dollars for that boil. It was subpar and you shouldn\u2019t get that if you\u2019re paying that much for some food. We were first-timers by the way and we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re never dining there ever again. My little cousin had a burger and some fries and his stuff was more filling than ours. My auntie and my grandma had some scampi and it was bland. Everything was bland. Before everything, they gave us some bread and that was the highlight of the whole evening!! The drinks were ok too. Overall we were so unsatisfied, and my other cousin left still hungry asking for McDonalds!! I would recommend going to Fisherman\u2019s Island and ordering a seasonal seafood boil for as little as 14.99!! To be honest 1 star is way too generous.",

The managers were so rude and not very accommodating until we complained several times. Some of the food came out cold and we had to complain about that.

Shrimp came out fast, hot and crispy but not much going on other than a basic breading, cocktail sauce and lemon. The oysters were the worst shuck job I\u2019ve ever encountered. The first one I put in my mouth was so gritty, I spit it out into my hand and back into the shell. Tried one from the second plate that felt okay in my mouth but I\u2019ve definitely swallowed oyster shell!!!! My throat is all cut up and it\u2019s still lodged in there!!!  The server was nice enough to take off one set oysters so that and a beer came to $14.22. I left her a $10 tip because obviously this is not her fault. I\u2019m leaving and going to Oyster Bah like I should have in the first place.",

I have never been treated with so much disrespect in my life. We eventually lefted . They ruined our mothers day dinner! Other places waa booked and full !!",

The battender was super nice and the drinks were excellent. They also have a large selection of beers. They have a few free parking spaces in front for guests and we got one so that helped. Now for the bad, and I will say that the bad definitely outweighed the good and I personally will not be back. The table in the back cold. We kept our winter coats on throughout dinner. My husband ordered a bowl of soup that never came. The waitress consistently said she'd be right back with things,  even things as basic as forks, and then never came back with them.. We had to ask others servers to send her over because we were neglected so long. My broiled whitefsh was inedible. My husband tasted it and concurred to make sure it wasn't just me. The waitress never came back to check after she served the food so I just sat there with this entire piece of bad fish in front of me for 20 minutes before telling another waiter I wanted to send it back. (That waiter, incidentally, was another good point. Good sense of humor and very helpful). After I sent my fish back we noticed that the table next to ours also sent back their blackened whitefish. A few minutes later the owner of the place made a point of coming to our table to reprimand me for ordering the broiled fish. He said you should never order broiled fish in a restaurant because if you have a sauce or blacken spices it covers up the taste (!!!!) Why put something on the menu if you think it tastes too bad to order? He did not bother to come yell at the people who sent back the blackened fish. My husband's snapper was also rubbery and fishy. In general I think this place does shellfish but does not do other things reliably. To the credit of the one waiter who came to help us when our waitress failed, he did take the snapper of our bill in addition to the whitefish. And he helped my mom crack her lobster (after the original waitress promised to return with crackers and never did).",

My brother in Law made Dinner reservations for us. It was His Mom, Him and my wife and three children. We were treating the moms to a special dinner. He had already arrived so I dropped my wife, mom, and kids at the door and went to look for parking. When my wife walked in she said \"Reservations for  Diaz\" The man at the door who we were later told was the owner/manager replied, \"Are you with the Spanish people?\" This was a very off-putting thing to say she had no idea what to reply she simply said \"Yeah I guess\" He pointed to the back of the restaurant. Later I walk in the door and told him \"yes I am here for the  Diaz reservation \" \"IN THE BACK\" ......  So that's how we started. So Are waiter was a nice guy we were ready to order after deliberating over what appetizers we were going to get. But the waiter wanted us to \"understand\" the menu and proceeded to tell us about it. Nice guy but totally unnecessary. We ordered got our \"Just ok\" food. The table across from us was having a terrible experience. It was an African American family celebrating mothers day too. They accused the owner of being racist, treating them poorly and giving them terrible service. Then It all really made sense when we \"The Spanish Family\" had been directed to the back. It really set the tone for the rest of our meal.  The nail in the coffin was when we had dessert and the waiter offered us a coffee. My wife and her mom ordered some coffee but it was ice cold. so The waiter took them back and went to make a fresh pot. We waited a while. I grew impatient so I decided to go get the car since I had to park two blocks away. 10 minutes later my wife comes to the car and says that the manager/Owner we think his name is Cy, came to her and said \"Did you get your check?\" \"Yes we did and we paid\" she replied. \"Ok you need to go people waiting for this booth\" WHOA blows my mind when I heard that. Mind you I know how it is when it's busy but c'mon really? That's just terrible service.  Never will I ever return to this establishment. - The Spanish Family",

When we finally got our meal nearly 2hr later is was cold. How disappointing. And on top of that they had our orders mixed up with another table. Both parties notified them of the problem and do you believe they just tried to switch the plates over. The nerve of them. We requested new meals. And do you believe about ten mins later they brought the same plate and served it to us (we knew because the crab leg was broken and some was ate off). This was unbelievable and unacceptable. We had to leave with incomplete orders and great dissatisfaction. After all that time I still didn't eat. Just about whole staff was rude (including the manager)   show and displayed poor customer service skills. We would never come here again, worst experience ever!!!!!!!",

While I could site the repeated lack of crab selections on multiple visits as a reason for our decision to never return, it is the hygienic concerns that solidified our need to avoid this place in the future. Tonight we watched at least 5 employees go outside to smoke, only to return to work without washing their hands. It was only one female who bothered to wash her hands before returning to work. The odor of cigarette smoke was thick on them, and the reality of their immediate return to their duties without cleaning their hands before touching food and plates being served to paying customers is too much. In this day and age it is simply unexcusable. After many years of patronizing this spot, we will not be returning.",

We were one of four seated tables.  I received shrimp that was only partially shelled and incredibly overcooked. I couldn't finish the meal. My girlfriend found herself sick nearly immediately after beginning the meal.  Payment took a bizarrely long time. I had begun to fear the server had fled the restaurant with my card.  The decor is also really confusing. The place looks as though it should be a high-end Asian Fusion restaurant or something while the menu called out \"Landlubber Specials\". The smell coming from the kitchen was nauseating\u2014old fish and garbage. Not appetizing. The bathroom also had a broken toilet and a sprung leak from the ceiling being treated by a disgustingly gunky looking bucket.
