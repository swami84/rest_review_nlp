The restaurant is a all you can eat in two hours hotpot heaven. The process is extreally fast and efficient. There is a tablet on the table for you to select all the ingredients. Remember to select your soup base first in which you will cook your own food in (if you are into spicy food they have some real hotties). Then you can select all the food you will to eat ranging from meat to viggies. The soup will come in a pot which is placed over a hot top. The ingredients will come raw and you place them into the boiling soup to cook. While you are waiting for your food to be cook, remember to visit the sauce station. They have everything to give you food that punch in your mouth. I have been to many hot pot places in New York, San Francisco, and the DMV area. This is a great place that you can never go wrong with. (FYI too busy eating so I forgot to take pictures but I will visit again soon! And hopefully not forget)",

If there\u2019s anything I suggest to improve,I would say the meal duration and Pre-meal services. We made a reservation at 5 pm on a windy and freezing Friday. Their door stay locked until 5 o\u2019clock even the customers standing outside the restaurant in the cold wind and are able to see the staff sitting inside and waiting through the glass. I understand it is policy and the staff don\u2019t do what they are not paying for. But it doesn\u2019t hurt if they just open the door and let us keep warm.  Second, the meal time limit is 2 hours. I understand it is out of restaurant profits. I recommend the staff could kindly remind the customer 15 min before their time\u2019s up so they could be mindful about the time. It is a shame I missed the shaved ice and it is a pain to go back again since I live 1 hour driving distance away.  Overall, the place is great! My friends and I really enjoyed the atmosphere and we had a wonderful time! Definitely recommend to anyone who wants an authentic bite of Chinese cuisine.",

        "caption": "Your \"senior advisor\" -- Yet another AYCE, hot pot restaurant.  Basically same thinly sliced, rolled, frozen, healthy food.  Your choice of brothes, meat, veggies, seafood, and a collection of herbs and spices to choose from.  Some places have staff carrying tablets to place your order.  Most others have a tablet on your table, as this place does.  We had been told by friends, that are more appropriate to the rest of the clientele, that this place is better that others.  So we had to go try it.  Being on a \"protein and salad\" diet, they didn't even have any lettuce.  But they did have \"Napa cabbage\", that sorta worked.  While some restaurants charge you per drink, these hot pots give refills.  This place actually gave you cans of soda, unlimited.  And as other of these places that we have tried, and there are a bunch, if you get there and you see a line, look for another place.  There is a two hour time limit, and time goes by very quickly as you are concentrating on all of the options you have.  Perhaps not so quick while you are waiting for a table.  Admitting that this was our first time THERE, they were incredibly helpful, and explained everything.  Just that their interpretation of less \"spicy\", and mine, is vastly different.  I'm going for a less spicy broth next time.  We'll definitely be back.  So many places, so many choices, all basically the same.  Hot pot.  Now throw in BBQ grill and that's another adventure.",

This explanation is hard to convince me, because I ordered the bottom of the pan in my order, but did not give me other dishes. And long hair was found in the subsequent smoothies, unhygienic. 30 minutes after serving, the service staff came over and told me that their kitchen was going to work and let me make the final order. To be honest, I have never given any hot pot restaurant such a bad review, but I made such a review today, and I hope that everyone will not have such encounters as I do. I just hope that the store can do better, but I don't think I will go to this hot pot restaurant again. I thought I would get better food and feel when I chose the most expensive lunch hotpot, but I was wrong. There are many cheaper hotpots here and the food is relatively better. I hope everyone will carefully screen.

You get to decide what broth you want, what choices of meat you want such as shrimp, lamb, beef as well as other choices. You also can create your own dipping sauce from a lovely variety of choices such as chili oil, peanut oil, and about 10 others. You can then go to the dry section to continue creating your own dipping sauce which has an amazing variety to choose from such as cilantro, peanuts, and many others. The broth is fabulous which they will allow you to take home so long as it is just broth....no meat. The staff are friendly, the place is clean; including  the bathrooms, and the food is great. The customers consist mostly of Asian decent which is a very good thing because that is a clear indicator that the place is the real deal. You can not go wrong at this fabulous restaurant.

The female manager immediately retorted that the ingredients were just bought from a nearby supermarket. There was no food quality problem and refused to apologize. The female manager apparently did not know that the supermarket was a well-known \"dwelling point\" for selling expired foods. It was very insensitive to food safety, neglecting existing problems, and could not beat the responsibility of any restaurant manager to serve customers well!  I have collected samples and complained to the Maryland Health Department. I also want to suggest that you carefully consider this restaurant when planning a banquet. If you really want to eat, be cautious and refuse expired food.  In case you have a problem, you are looking for a boss to defend your rights, or are you going to experience how they cook? Who knows?  (To the restaurant owner: The original star is not willing to give it, but the one star is given to other waiters in your restaurant.

They also have fast lunch option noodle bowl and best bubble tea around.  Lucky us they brought the best spicy numbing ChongQing flavor here.  The all-you-can-eat is such a great value. So many options to choose from and they are all very good. Everything I try was amazing. The meat, vegetables, tofu, seafood are all very fresh and homemade! The soup base has amazing flavor and depth - nothing overdone- everything just right. Besides the spicy broth the non spicy options like pickled vegetable are amazing as well. Sometime I'll get the split pot just to have different flavor.  Besides the Hot Pot they will have bubble tea and special authentic Chinese noodle options if you need a quick lunch during the week.  Go try it now! You'll be very happy!",
