At least to find a way to make a delivery that\u2019s less than a mile away. I placed an order again this week hoping for the best. The delivery driver sounded like she was choosing not to speak English and that\u2019s fine if she didn\u2019t understand it but I was trying to speak to her in Spanish and she told me to come out to her car and hung up on me. I set the delivery for leave at door, so it\u2019s just upsetting that we had to struggle and search around the block for this driver who then decided not to pick up the phone. When we finally found her and got the order, our pizza box fell on the floor and she didn\u2019t even say sorry. She seemed very lazy and if they cared about their customers at all she could have helped and gotten out of the vehicle to follow our delivery instructions so our pizza wouldn\u2019t have been so cold. We also paid for extra sauce that they did not include.",

It\u2019s interesting that the delivery is supposed to be contactless yet they are forcing me to come in contact with them during this pandemic. It is also obnoxious to have to go downstairs. As lazy as it sounds, if I wanted to leave my home I would have done a pickup and/or dined out. It is clear safety is not a priority. In addition to this, they always forget something and always forget sauces. What is MOST upsetting is the fact that I have contacted the regional manager for this part of Florida and she has yet to return my calls or emails. It seems customer service just isn\u2019t a priority across the company. This is actually an issue I had at a previous residence. Because I am petty, I calculated amount spent at dominos. Between corporate functions and personal use\u2014 I spend about $10,000 a year at dominos. If the quality and taste was better at competitors I would take my business elsewhere.",

A few weeks ago, I placed an online order with this location. Domino\u2019s tracker showed that the order was out for delivery. After showing that status for over 20 minutes, I called the store and they told me to wait a bit longer as the delivery person was currently out with orders. Over an hour with the same \u2018out for delivery\u2019 status, I gave up and ordered from elsewhere. When calling for a refund, I was placed on hold for over ten minutes and the person on the phone offered to give the message to the manager. The order was refunded without follow up... no worries, sometimes these things happen.  Today, I tried to place another order, giving this location another chance. The tracker has been set to \u2018prep\u2019 for over an hour, and no one answers the phone at the store.  Impossible to get service from this location, at least by delivery.",

Then I must go through the hassles of assuring the credit was ever issued. Bc they will lie about that too! Even after I've used the app and prepaid for the order.  Sadly, I live only 2 blocks from this store and the time it takes to bake the pie is twice times the length of distance to the shop. The reason I say this is because who once was a regular of this location, I've seen the level of service & business reach its lowest.  The total lack of respect, customer care and total disregard for the appreciation of business. This staff makes it seem as if you are entitled when ordering from them. It starts and end with the lack of training and leadership from the top.",

They consider the order abandoned and use its parts to ensure the deliveries get out faster.  Its super easy to pop the box open and slide the pie into a new box and label it for a new order.  Its happened to me the last two times I've went in.  I come in like 45 minutes after I place the order and when I get there pieces of the order are sitting on the heat shelf but the order is never complete.  They communicate in Spanish and they think I don't understand but I do.   : )",

When someone did answer it was the driver. He said to hold on let him get the manager and guess what? The manager never even got on the phone to apologize. The driver said that he will bring it to me in Which he did and on the fly. This store has Nothing but little kids who apparently can't read cus on the screen it clearly said wings.

I can not order there in the cashier as his answer was \u201cI\u2019m busy\u201d (welcome to life my friend, everyone is busy.)  I told him I\u2019ll wait until u can place the order. He refused and kept repeating I\u2019m busy with the worst attitude. I asked nicely why they do not answer as I have been on hold for over 20 minutes and was still on hold when I got there. ( I even showed him the phone ) This mas was super rude and condescending to the point I walked out and wasted my time going there for absolutely no reason.

First time I went a couple of months ago, there was an argument between two employees over an order called in not being delivered. They just started verbally going at it in front of customers, including me waiting online. I waited for about 10 minutes, I said \u201cexcuse me\u201d a few times to get some help ordering, and no one seemed to care. So I just left the premises. Just earlier this afternoon, I tried again for the second time. This time I got my order, sat down with a friend and ate. Some drunken street thug just walked in, and started having a very disrespectful chat with the employees. The guy was cursing, talking about d*ck sucking, cussing constantly, yet two employees just stood there engaging into the conversation as if they were interested in everything he had to say. He even decided to sit on top of the counter where the cash box is, and no one said anything. They just allowed him to do whatever he wanted. He then came to my table and started verbally harrasing me and my friend. For her safety, I just told her let\u2019s get up and go as I was very close to phisically taking him down. The employees just stood there and watched him go on and on, nobody did nothing. I live in this neighborhood and the employees at this location are a disgrace to the Dominoes brand. Never again will I go back to this location.",

Also, the crust was absolutely atrocious which is why I explained to the store manager that I would personally drive and simply exchange the untouched pizzas for thin crust pizzas of the same toppings. After saying no to the exchange AND no to a refund, I simply was left with no choice but to write this complaint, as I will also write it in a yelp review. I am a customer, a client, the most important thing to a business; I'm completely offended and disgusted by the treatment that I have received today and will NEVER order from Dominos again.

I waited an hour and 10 minutes (70 minutes) before calling to find out why I hadn\u2019t received my pizza and how long it would be. After an additional 10 minutes on hold, I was told the pizza was still at the store, and that there were still several deliveries ahead of mine. They wouldn\u2019t tell me any sort of estimate on how much longer it would take. I told them to cancel the order. I was told it would take 3-5 business days to refund my order. I love pizza, and I\u2019ve ordered from various Dominos pizzas before, because I enjoy their pizza, but I will not order from this Dominos again. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve had an issue with delivery from this store, but it will be the last.  Do not order from this Dominos.",

I ordered online and went to the counter to pick up. The employee that helped was just making pizzas which she stopped to come to the register. She went on the computer keyboard (which looked filthy) then answer a phone call without cleaning her hands. She gave me my order status and went straight to continue to make pizzas. The woman DID NOT WASH HER HANDS and she WAS NOT wearing gloves!!! With the same hands she grabbed the cheese and toppings and threw them on the pizzas. My jaw dropped because I could only wonder if she washes her hands after scratching her head, picks her nose, uses the restroom! Etc. Later a male employee walked in and proceeded to help out and he wasn\u2019t wearing gloves either. Looks like these kids need some training on sanitation and hygiene.  Old review: I ordered online for delivery today for the first time. Per my confirmation the pizza would arrive in 15-25 mintues. After 1.5 hours I called the store to check what happened. A very unconcerned Joanne simply said it's normal they take long bc they're always understaffed. I asked her to speak to management and said, \"oh, they'be been aware.",

I will never order from this dominoes again nor the one on like Biscayne and 79th. For a corporate store, corporate is also to blame.  Even after nearly waiting 2 hours for crappy food, every time I called the store to speak to a manager, the person taking the call completely ignored me and placed me on hold . After 5 to 6 minutes on hold I hung up and called back.  but I was once again ignored and placed on hold. Corporate needs to shut this place down or start all over. maybe someone from corporate should place an order and see how it goes for them.",

On another occasion I ordered pick up when I arrived an hour later my order was never made. I had to wait at the restaurant for them to make my order which took another 45 minutes.  Today I order my pizza at 9:19pm the order tracker said 12-17 minutes I went to pick up my pizza at 9.52 and again it has not been made. Now I\u2019m here waiting and I was just told they made the wrong pizza. It is now 9:58 and I have to again wait to get my order. When I inquired why am I just being notified the manager began talking in Spanish and offered me a free soda and told me I still have to wait 45 minutes because there  are other orders before mine. I am very upset and I satisfied with the service I receive each time I decide to buy pizza for me and my family. A quick dinner now takes longer  than it takes to cook a complete Sunday dinner for my entire extended family. I hope something is done to improve customer experience.",

At 8 pm I called the store because at this point I still had no pizza and it had been out of the oven for 40 minutes.  How good could it possibly be now?  Their attitude was \u201ctoo bad, nothing we can do, driver is on the way \u201c.  No offer to remake and send another fresh one.  No discount.  No apology. Just \u201cit will be there soon\u201d  Pizza arrived at 8:13.  That\u2019s one hour and 6 minister after I ordered (app estimate was 27-37 minutes).  I can live with that part though. What gets them one star is the pizza was out of the oven for 52 minutes before it finally arrived and was completely cold.  Zero stars for their attitude",
