I feel like it\u2019s only fair to start with the positives. First of all, the view from the rooftop is incredible. You get two different views, one of FiDi and one of Midtown/Hudson Yards. I\u2019d suggest going before the sunset so you can see the transition from day to night - it\u2019s really cool. Another positive is that their beer is fantastic. It\u2019s a little expensive, and the pitchers are really small, but the beer is truly awesome!  I guess the glaring negative is that the service was not very good. They were completely swamped and we had to wait forever for drinks, food, the check, etc. They also double charged me for the tip which is my mistake. Lastly, the menu online and the in person menu don\u2019t match. The prices are different and the correct menu is reflected in my pictures.  I\u2019d be willing to give them another shot, but I was a little bit turned off after my first visit. I do also understand that COVID has not made it easy for restaurants by any means.",

The first red flag was when the cashier asked me to put my face mask on immediately. There is no problem with that but he sounded extremely rude. I apologized and put the mask on. After that, I asked him for a beer sample, he brought it to us, my friend and I didn\u2019t like it. We asked him for a recommendation. He recommended another beer and we kindly asked him to try that one and... We got the nastiest attitude ever. He asked me if I did realize how far he had to walk to bring us the first sample? I apologized to him. He said -\u201cit\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll bring it to you\u201d. However, we decided to leave. Honestly, I got shocked by his behavior. We wanted to support a local business during these harsh times by making a purchase there, but apparently they are doing just fine even tho the place was empty in a middle of sunny Saturday. I didn\u2019t catch his name but it was tall Caucasian guy with blond hair in his 40s. I Will never go to that place again.",

Went in around 12:45 were told we could only order from dinner menu, so limited meal options. They didn't really have table service in the upper area. You order at the bar, if you don't sit at the bar the kitchen staff, an expediter, delivers the food. If you're there long enough someone from the back will come with water, but there isn't a waiter- it was strange I was unsure if you're supposed to tip, I covered the bill and left a typical tip amount as it was $90 without the tip to put a few bucks more didn't really matter.

(Original) Bah, o lugar \u00e9 bom e a cerveja Muuuuito Boa. Mas deixa a desejar no servi\u00e7o. \u00c9 dele ser vice de cerveja, com \u00f3timos estilos. Mas pra conseguir o cart\u00e3o pra se servir tem que ser insistente. Depois a gente se serve. Os pratos s\u00e3o simples, mas saborosos. Pre\u00e7os? De nova iorque, claro.  \u00c9 a gorjeta \u00e9 por fora do cart\u00e3o,  mas se n\u00e3o melhorar no servi\u00e7o n\u00e3o deixo mais. Ha, e os banheiros s\u00e3o unisex.",

Decor/atmosphere was good knowing that it is noisy - fun for people watching, not a place for quiet conversation. Credit cards only which works for me and the self serve beer was an interesting concept.  Beer brewed onsite was hit or miss where my friend's was good and mine was fine but it didn't match the style it was supposed to be.  Bartenders were good, the real downfall was the kitchen.  Both food orders came out majorly wrong and while our bill was adjusted to make up for the errors, the food wasn't that great for what it was.",

That being said, the food is surprisingly decent and the staff has always been great. The place also looks quite nice. A pool table wouldn't hurt, but I get it if that's not the sort of atmosphere they want.  Given the frustrating lack of options in the neighborhood I'd recommend popping over if you're in the area and feel like some food and a beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

Take the card from bartender, choose the beer you want, place the card under the device and pour what and you want and how much you want. That's really great! I need a place like this in Warsaw, Poland. We ordered some food to share: hummus plate and a dessert served in a beer mug (really big one!) - both very tasty. It's a very chilled out place (watch the signs at the entrance to the restroom ;) ), you can do what you want. In my opinion that place has one weakness: you can choose from over than 20 kinds of beer but only from few types - mostly porters and ipas which aren't my favourites. I can honestly recommend La Grosse Pomme and sour beers if you like it. Note that beers presented at their webiste are different from those served at the bar.",
