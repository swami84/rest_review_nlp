They came every other second and kept looking at our table and the contents, to see if they could be of any service. Which was kind of annoying and not a relaxing dinner experience. They literally took the plates of the table and cleaned the table when we just put the last bite in our mouths. No time to swallow and they already asked if we were ready for desert.",

We especially enjoyed the Churrasco, grilled asparagus with a pomegranate aioli, and the bacalao croquettes.  A small pitcher of sangria was the perfect size for the 2 of us, providing about 3 glassfuls. The service was very good, even on a busy Friday night.  The sound level was not an issue at all.  We highly recommend trying it out.  We will be returning.",
