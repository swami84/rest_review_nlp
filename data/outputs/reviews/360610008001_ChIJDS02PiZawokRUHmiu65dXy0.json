Btw, the food was great and the service was excellent. Hot Tan tan noodle was perfect, the dry saut\u00e9ed crispy beef was \u201cmust try\u201d and snow pea sprouts in broth was so fresh and tasty. Like the Jasmine hot tea. Gonna come back for dinner dishes.",

Charged fine ding price but really hole in the wall place service. Chipped serving plates like previous review.  But what really bothered me was the Chef guy came to our table and never left. He hijacked the conversion, and turned the topic to himself and himself only. His hands were touching my friend's arms while he was  making his uninvited speech ...and encouraged the whole table got up and toast every 5 minute.. I was really confused and bothered by this kind gesture. Not sure if this is a culture thing but it was certainly a turn off for me.",

Peking duck wrap was served cold...... we would go to pecking duck house next time when we crave for pecking duck.  Sour cabbage fatty beef soup was a fail, no taste of sour cabbage, rather hint of black vinegar... it's like hot and sour soup with fatty beef but without the proper seasoning- fail.  All the serving wear were chipped in multiple areas, gotta be careful scratching yourself.  All the signs show lack of proper management. The Chef/ Owner came out and talked bragged about his own vision of life time achievement and how unique/fresh the food is... talked cross over people's drinks and groped while he talked ( his hand was always touching an audience's body) , it was really distributing and unprofessional. We came here for fine food and pleasant dining experience, not the unwanted attention/borderline sexual harassment from the owner, or ear full of his childhood struggle and how he moved to the State....  The dining experience was ODD to say at the least. Not worth the price to return. We should be paid to listen to the owner talking our ears out the whole night... exhausting.",

We ordered Peking duck, Dong Po Pork and Tang's Amazing Tofu for takeout. Arrived on time for pick up and wait for 10 minutes more, not a big deal.  To begin with, Peking duck isn\u2019t the best we have had in the city; a bit soggy, not much aroma and the pancake is doughy.(perhaps we order half duck so it isn\u2019t... made the same day?). Tofu is fine. The biggest problem is the pork, at first taste the pork is sour. Having been to China many times, I really don\u2019t think the seasoning is right. It\u2019s pretty blend. We have to throw away the $30 pork since the meat is not fresh and eatable. What a disappointment.  Perhaps the chef is not on site yesterday for supervision. But if my feedback could be seen and taken into consideration, I will love to give the place another chance.",

        "caption": "My son wanted Peking duck. The last time we ate it was in 2017 so he was due. Previously, we had gone to Peking Duck House on Mott street in Chinatown. We had fond memories of it, but looking at recent reviews, it sounded like it had lost its sheen. After a quick search, Hwa Yuan came up as a solid recommendation for Chinese food in general, but Peking duck (or as they correctly call it, Beijing duck). Having another friend who happened to be there earlier that day who highly recommended it sealed the deal for us. Chinatown is an interesting neighborhood where you'll find marketplaces that look like they've been around for decades with cut up cardboard with prices sharpied onto it juxtaposed next to completely renovated remodeled edifices with glass and clean lines. Hwa Yuan was the latter - kind of a modern oasis on a street still fighting progress. So first impressions - interior decor: very clean and modern. We made reservations via OpenTable so no waiting. We were taken to the second floor. Note that the space is partially sectioned off giving the quasi-private room feel without totally making you feel like you're on your own. There were several waitstaff personnel always around at any given time. And they weren't the useless kind that just stand around to give the impression of service. Our waters were constantly refilled and someone was always available to bring a replacement chopstick or something. They used heavy plates with a large one underneath a medium sized plate which was frequently taken away and replaced with a fresh one. They even provided two sets of chopsticks which we had never seen before and when asked, the staff responded that one set is for serving yourself from the public family style plates onto your plate, while the other chopstick set is for you to actually eat off your plate. Genius - but you better hope your fellow diners remembered which one was for what. So the waiter explained that the Beijing duck could take up to 45 minutes to prepare so you can imagine our surprise when our duck appeared after only a few minutes. My only explanation is that in my OpenTable reservation, I put in the comments that we were going to order the duck so maybe they got one going in advance of our arrival. The duck was very well sliced and a nice pile of extra duck skin was provided as well. Small plates of the duck accouterments (e.g., slivers of spring onions, asian pear, and cucumber) as well as a bamboo steam basket of the wrappers were brought out. This was disappointingly small portioned - we easily went through 3 refills of the stuff before we ran out of duck. But the duck was deliciously fatty and crispy, married with the crunchy slivers, with a touch of the hoisin sauce resulted in a luxurious combination. The one other disappointment was that the wrappers were ripped with dry edges. But they tasted good and provided a good vessel for all the fillings. Quick notes on the other dishes: snow pea shoots in garlic sauce- just ok (e.g., pretty generic); mapotofu-tasty but not that spicy (could have been victim to my dining buddy asking for everything to be mild); house special hunan chicken-very delicious; pork soup dumplings-nice and soupy and very tasty; cold sesame noodles-came highly recommended but not really my thing due to its slightly acidified sesame oil taste and the weirdly dense texture of the noodles; pan fried noodles with seafood-very delicious with plenty of fried noodles. In general, all the food was pretty tasty but felt overpriced (or underportioned, especially since the serving plates are huge). At the end of the day, the restaurant was a very upscaled Chinese food restaurant, high on the authenticity levels but (necessarily) high on the price side. Definitely an elevated Chinese food experience - well suited for folks looking for a solid food experience in a place much nicer than your corner Chinese takeout.",

We ordered a ton of food that the head chef gave us a few free dishes on the house - what a gesture. He even came out to chat with us and get our feedback on the food. That was pretty cool.  Service: 10/10 Gave us a complimentary round of beers and a nice seafood dish. Very friendly folks. Food came out hot and quick.

They put us at the bar for 5-10 mins whilst they found us (2) a table, transferred the bar tab to the table, no muss no fuss. Happy to take the order for starters and mains (appetizers and entrees) to come out together. Christmas Day and very busy so I can't fault them for struggling to get it all out at once; they kept the food coming quickly enough for us to share and be satisfied. (If we'd had our own each we'd have been disappointed.) They apologised and provided freebies for the wait (veggie dumplings, not our taste but fair enough), cancelled the rice side and added more crispy beef per our last-minute request.  It was fun watching shredded duck pancakes being served to adjacent tables, very different to what we've seen before in the UK.  All-in-all, excellent food, attentive service, reasonable prices. Five stars.",

Our waitress did a great job cutting the duck. She extracted as much meat as she could. We decided to take the duck carcous back home to make soup the next day.  Overall, the food is cooked with a very high level of care compared to other Chinese restaurants. Because of this, it is reflected in the price. In conclusion, my family and I enjoyed our dinner because of the exceptional service and food. I highly recommend Hwa Yuan Szechuan if you're looking for an upscale Chinese restaurant.",

While visiting NYC with the kids and friends, we took our party to this place and they were able to seat our party of 8 without a reservation, The place is up market, very clean, and super attentive staff. They keep the place running with a hum. Its not pressured, but they make sure the guest have everything they need. Order some starters, main dishes and a Peking duck - all excellent. Nothing we ordered was bad at all. It may not be the cheapest of places, but if you take effort to visit this place (it is off the beaten path a little, but otherwise safe looking place), you will not be disappointed. The chef greeted us on the way out and can be seen mingling with his guests - very charming.",

They couldn't figure out when and how to clear plates.  Some of the food was tasty, some meh - but Szechuan should be spicy, and this was not spicy at all. It had chilis but maybe the wrong kind or something? No seriously, I'm not just acclimated to heat, this wasn't even sriracha-level spicy. We even ordered chili sauce and it wasn't spicy either.  Of course, it's very expensive as well. $70 each for dinner before drinks.  Some recommendations that are perfectly clean, delicious and easy to get a large table: Wu Wonton King (call ahead for whole roast pig!), Ping, Mission Chinese (spicy!).  OWNERS: two easy ways to improve: 1) ask your patrons how spicy they would like the food, and make the chili sauce spicy. 2) reduce prices by 10-15% to match other restaurants. if you do this, I will come back and update the review.",

It is much more delicious than Da Dong. At least it is not firewood. Although it is not comparable to domestic ones, it is very good. Maybe it is because of the duck breed problem, the skin is not crisp enough. I can't experience the pleasure of duck skin and white sugar. His family environment is very good, counted in front of Chinatown, and then the noodles with sesame sauce is particularly delicious. Other cooking has been visited several times.

Crispy beef and cold sesame noodles were my favorite, but the ginger sliced duck was also excellent.  I might skip the pork dumpling, but it was still well prepared.  Can\u2019t wait to come back on our next trip.   Beautiful restaurant in the midst of bustling China town.  Three spacious floors with nicely set tables and solid service.",

They even brought an ice bucket for our bottle of Prosecco. We ordered the Cold Sesame Noodles (10/10), pan fried dumplings (10/10), soup dumplings (7/10), crispy beef (10/10), Kung pao potatoes (very good and had never had before!), hunan chicken, shrimp fried rice and green string beans.

Two tables were seated after us yet visited before ours. The worst part was when we asked for the rest of our bottle of wine to go. We were informed that 'due to the law,' they couldn't allow us to leave w the bottle but would give us a container instead. They gave us a quart plastic container.",

She\u2019s being rude by telling her server to take back the dessert that he\u2019s about to give us on the house. Its not about the free coconut pudding that was sent back but yhe fact that she\u2019s coming over back to our table after our server taking back the dessert and telling us that he should take back the dessert because it was a day old and its not fresh ( and we believe him and fine with that) but then she\u2019s coming over and telling us that he should not do that, giving away free food and taking it back. The only mistake he had is giving us a free complimentary dessert which is an inexpensive dessert ( it doesnt cost them not even $1) but she\u2019s making a very big mistake by coming over and ask him to take away the dessert. It was very very very unfortunate decision on her part which left a bad impression overall for what would\u2019ve been a good dining experience.",

Peking duck with 2 vegetables, 1 appetizer, 2 sides, and 3 entree shared dishes. The Peking duck was good. We were the first table to be sat in our area. Every other table around us got their food immediately. Water, drinks, etc. served at a reason time.We sat down. Table isn\u2019t set, water was asked for several times. No one gave us menus to order. Finally, the manager took our order. We waited 1.5 hours for 3 dishes. Food came sporadically and incredible slow. Everyone around us got their food on time. No one checked in on us. We tried several times to flag the waitstaff. No one came. Finally, some more dishes arrived but one of our mains was incorrect. By this time we were confused and upset about the experience thus far. We told the manager, he tried to pass off the incorrect dish as the correct one. We have had the dish before so we know what it looks like. He sends us \u201ccomplimentary\u201d green beans for the mistake. But it was ice cold compared to other dishes. We figured it was a mistake order they tried to pass off as complimentary. They gave us an excuse that the kitchen is backed up. Which normally I would understand, but that\u2019s not correct if everyone else who came and ordered after us also get their food late... but it was only our table.. Then they said the kitchen lost our order bill... but if that\u2019s the case, why was no one checking on us? they sent another dish complimentary. But that time we were incredibly upset, loss our appetite and horrified by the experience. We didn\u2019t touch the complimentary dishes.. we told them we were disappointed by the experience . Their response? We gave you free stuff. Horrified? So were we. I\u2019ll end the description here.  To the management: We didn\u2019t come there to get free food so thank you for that. We came to eat at the restaurant because we had a positive previous experience eating delicious food. Treating customers with respect shouldn\u2019t have been something we should ask for. This is basic training in hospitality management. Our wait time was ridiculous compared to other tables who came after us, food that was incorrect, the manager to pass off second handed dish as complimentary dishes and overall terrible service. These are horrifying reflections of the restaurant\u2019s management. Do you want your restaurant\u2019s faith to be like that of Dadong? Again, we didn\u2019t ask for the complimentary dishes you brought out. They weren\u2019t what we ordered. We didn\u2019t even eat them. We had ordered what we wanted. We were just looking for good food and family time. Never have I ever experienced such bad service. This will be a meal to remember.",

Didn\u2019t see a single table of Chinese family on our way up to second flat, guess that explains the authenticity of the food here. Pretty pricey but consider the environment it\u2019s reasonable. Taste? Fine but My grandparents came to NY to visit so we were kind of looking for something more than the spacial experience. And from what we had it was not really satisfying.",

From what I can tell no expense was spared in the restaurant\u2019s construction. It\u2019s beautiful, definitely not your typical Chinatown dive. Their cold sesame noodle are the best I\u2019ve ever had, a subtle sesame flavor with perfectly textured noodles, unlike the typical peanut butter soy concoction noodles at most restaurants. Their Peking duck is second to none, with wonderful flavor and crisp skin, without the fat dripping all over the place. I\u2019ve had their hot & sour soup, eggplant with garlic sauce, fish in hot bean sauce, baked black cod, and spicy wine chicken, among other wonderful dishes.  There is a lot more on the menus and I\u2019m looking forward to exploring new things.",

Food portion sized for supermodels who don\u2019t mind paying $50 for one scallop on a plate. Peking duck not freshly made tastes equivalent to the chef purchasing takeout one block away then reheating it on plate to be served at 8x the price. Limited choices in menu -a lot of spicy dishes. Long wait prior to being seated despite reservations and long wait for each dish to be served. One star for decor and cleanliness.  If you are hungry don\u2019t expect to be full after eating here. Diners come to sit and mingle but not to eat-didn\u2019t realize this was \u201cthat\u201d kind of restaurant. Come for ambiance not food. Not family friendly-more for business meetings. Why pay the astronomical prices just to end up hungry? Minimum $100 per person spent and $48 for few cups of tea but left with an empty stomach. Noticed few Chinese patrons in this \u201cChinese\u201d restaurant located in Chinatown-I wonder why? Don\u2019t believe the 5 star ratings with no comments-they\u2019re made by owners to boost their star ratings. All a true disappointment!",

We also had the privilege of meeting chef Tang who had a personal interest in our dining experience! My colleague and I were blown away with how well they treated us, chef Tang even making a special dish on the house since it was our first time visiting.  Our first visit we had the Kung Po Chicken with hot pepper sauce, the Kung Po baby mix potatoes, the Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce and the Steamed Spare Ribs Coated with Sticky Rice with a side of rice. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful, having the right balance of sweetness with spiciness. We were blown away with how delicious it tasted!  The second time we visited we tried the Bejing Duck (half), the Pan Fried Dumplings and a side of rice. Kevin, the director, was very friendly and helpful and we were delighted with his service! He even surprised us with an additional dish on the house!We thoroughly enjoyed the Bejing Duck as the meat was tender and flavorful and the skin was crispy and delicious!  All in all, there was not a single dish eaten that we did not thoroughly enjoy, not to mention the friendless, hospitality and welcoming nature of every staff member we met! This restaurant, their staff and the chef all deserve the two stars awarded to them by the New York Times critic and more!  If you are ever near China Town, this restaurant is a must. You will not be disappointed!",

While it\u2019s a beautifully renovated space, it\u2019s very expensive for a chinese restaurant. I went here one two occasions. Once for dinner and once for an event. Dinner service was ok. We ordered a chicken and a noodle dish, which tasted ok, nothing incredibly impressive especially for a high price. When we came for an event they ran out of food quickly and were slow to refill their buffet, which was disappointing. The prices were as if we were eating in Long Island and not on East Broadway. If I was not familiar with the other offerings in the area I would have enjoyed the food and the price for it more but unfortunately that\u2019s not the case.",

When we got our first entree, Peking duck, they forgot to bring the wrap which took another 5 mins.  After another 30 mins, they brought only one more entree and forgot our last one.  When i asked the waiter about our last entree, it took the them another 10 mins.  Meanwhile, it is close to impossible to get any staff to remove the empty plates.  The best part is when we pay for our tap, the  staff said that we tipped too little (15% of the tab) which i thought we were being nice given the terrible service.  At that point, we told them what they done and stormed out.  For the price that they charge, their total service wasn't good enough for me to even think about going back never the less recommend it to other.

I ordered the Cold Noodles which apparently are critically acclaimed by the NYP. I have since been back and tried the Peking Duck - which is the best I have had in the city. Lastly, I would like to comment on the staff. I sat at the bar and was taken care of by Edwin, who was behind the bar, and Samantha, whom I believe is a manager. They were extremely friendly and personable, which is something I can't say about the other restaurants in the area. I have Hwa Yuan in my top 5 places in the city and will be using it as my go-to when guests are in town. Thankful that I live close by and can take advantage of their expertise.",

More expensive that typical for Chinese restaurants in the area, I feel every dollar was worth it and it replaced my previous favorite Sichuan restaurant. I'm looking forward to my next visit. They even have dessert, and it's good; they made it sweet, presumably with the Western palate in mind.  The owner comes around to greet guests. He told us how he reopened the family restaurant my demand of old customers, and he designed everything from the ambience, different in each of the three floors, to the tableware.",

The food here is delicious, thoughtfully prepared, and tasty...but if you are here during a holiday, the food can be a bit off. Round 1 of the xiao long bao was undercooked and didn't have any soup in them.  They made up a new one for us, but it took a while.  There were odd breaks between our dinner as certain dishes took an inordinate amount of time to come out.  The snow pea leaves in the supreme broth had no broth and quite frankly was over cooked.  The whole dish was bitter and you can barely swallow your food.  This is a whole 180 from the first time we came where everything was spot on...so I am conflicted with my review.  The food then was absolutely amazing and everything came out in a timely fashion.  The peking duck, both times, was delicious and MUCH BETTER than The Peking Duck House on Mott Street.  The service during both times was impeccable.  The wait staff was attentive, polite, and helpful with menu recommendations.  The have an extensive wine selection.  The price is moderate to high for the dishes.  Overall, I suggest you give them a try and assess for yourself.",

The decor, service and design, entrance was solid the moment you walk in, this Is not your typical Chinese restaurant or Seafood place. This place is the standard for any restaurant. We were initially told it\u2019s 45min wait if we wanted to sit in the main area but after speaking to hostess (very courteous) she said we could sit in the tables by the bar and it\u2019s full menu (except Peking Duck), which we\u2019re fine since we actually had it for lunch earlier. We got xialongbao & crispy tangy need as appetizer, mountain ham (Japanese) & snap pea that had Jew\u2019s Ear (type of fungus) and Goji - something Chinese family would make. We also got the Oxtail in chefs specialty and the Whole fish. We enjoyed every dish and my friend just wanted more rice to go with the flavor and sauce.  After we paid the bill, the main chef /owner came over and started explaining how and what type of fish we just had and I had never heard of it. He also told us the ingredients are hand picked and good quality and they don\u2019t cook with ton of oil and it is home style. Which we just rave about it\u2019s like top home cooking, the fact Mr. Tang spent time to engage and tell us how the restaurant \u201ccame back\u201d and how he offered to show us around presenting proudly the decor and style he picked and he even did the center piece with fresh flower they get every week so basically got an inside tour!",

The space is massive and most of the appointments like the crockery, chopsticks, and cutlery are quite beautiful. The tea cups only work if you're right handed, but they are nice. There are ornate carved doors, art and decorative pieces throughout the space. The muted grey linens and the waiter uniforms are very tasteful.  There were three different lighting sconces on the same walls in the dining room we were in and completely incongruent overhead fixtures. I'm not sure why the designer chose the lighting scheme. I've seen similar choices in other Chinese places. Perhaps it has to do with feng shui.  The service was terrible. The waitress was very sweet, but her English was hard to understand. She spent a lot of time apologizing.  Most places when you just open, bite the bullet and schedule too much floor and kitchen crew. This was woefully understaffed. People waited and waited to order. Drinks took forever. Tables did not get cleared. Wine got dropped at the table and not opened. People had to beg for their checks. They didn't have things that were on the drink menu, like cranberry juice. There were no limes in the restaurant.  The kitchen was not able to handle the guests. The food took FOREVER with many, many promises that it was coming. We ordered a dish that she said they didn't have. Then she said they had it. By the time our food was supposed to come, they'd run out of it. NOT GOOD.  We waited so long for one of our dishes we said to forget it and asked for the check. Then the dish arrived and we said we didn't want it. They offered it wrap it up for us and take it off the check. We said, \"We don't want it.\" The waitress insisted that we take it, and then never took it off the check.  There was what looked like a manager coming into the dining room periodically, who did NOTHING. Anyone who has ever worked in a dining room could see that tables needed to be bussed and orders needed to be taken, wine poured, etc., but the guy just looked around and walked away.  Now to the food. They serve their famous cold sesame noodles as a very decent sized amuse bouche, if you are lucky enough to get it. I noticed one of the tables near us didn't get it because theirs was served to a different table. When another waiter came out with the noodles that were supposed to be served to the second table he was confused that they already had them. The noodles are very tasty.  The rest of the food was overpriced and some didn't make sense. The first dish was black fungus and frisee. It had a very light black vinegar and sichuan peppercorn dressing that lacked the personality to make the fungus, which is mostly texture and not flavor, interesting.  A dish on the menu was called short Rib on sticky rice. I couldn't find the rice in the dish. It was pleasant tasting pieces of beef atop chunks of sweet potato. I mentioned the lack of rice to the waitress and she said it was amongst the seasoning on the beef. There may have been a few grains, but not enough to say the short rib was on rice.  The hot and sour soup was $10.00 and a single bowl serve. The ingredients were nicer than your average $1.00 bowl of the soup you can grab at many cheap take-out spots in the area, but it was neither hot or sour.  The deluxe seafood lo mein tasted good, but looked terrible for $18.00 and there was something not quite right with the massive sea scallops.  We didn't eat the last one. The shrimp were lukewarm.  The snow peas shoots in broth ($18.00) tasted like snow pea shoots in water. The garlic was tasteless.  The orange beef ($28.00) was what we  took home. They didn't even send white rice with it. It was fine.  They have a long way to go to get the place in order and to become the restaurant that warrants the pricing they are asking for.",
