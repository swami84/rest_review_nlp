        "caption": "I came here last week from NYC and browsed through the mall and decided to try this spot. I ordered the Dinner for Two which consists of 4 empanadas (2 Tampa Girl, 1 Cheeseburger in Paradise, and 1 Buffalo Soldier 2.0), fries, and 2 drinks. Also ordered Tacos Y'all which consists of 2 tacos (1 Chicken and 1 Pork)  and a side of chips and salsa. The cashier was friendly and after you order, you will be handed a food pager that buzzes when your order is ready. At that time, they do not accept cash as they do not have a cash register. It is pretty costly, my bill came up to a little over $40. The tacos were great along with the chips and salsa. The empanadas were tasty, although salty, specifically the Cheeseburger in Paradise. It had a good amount of pickles in  it which gets overwhelming after several bites. Their fries were amazing also their chips and queso which my sister ordered. The wait time was around 10 to 15 minutes. Overall very good.",

They also added brussel sprouts and broccoli in it which is really weird. Veggie taco doesn't mean you can add all of irrelevant veggies. You should change veggie taco filling. You can make it with avocado, salsa, grilled mushroom, beans, onion something taste like taco.",

Today, I tried the Cheeseburger in Paradise empanada which was a take on the classic beef and cheese.  Overall, it's a good empanada.  It's VERY cheesy to the point that it almost oozes out when you bite into it.  It almost tastes like one of those cheeseburger pizzas or a cheeseburger Hot Pocket.  I also tried the bang bang shrimp taco as well as the chicken taco.  The bang bang shrimp was way too spicy for me to handle.  I'm a wimp when it comes to spices, but I can usually handle a little heat.  This definitely has a bit of a kick to it, but it ultimately was too much for me.  I almost wish it was a shrimp taco rather than chicken.  It would've been a little lighter and the crunch on it would've been great.  The other chicken taco was good as well; light, fresh, but not a lot of flavor to it.  I tasted mostly the toppings rather than the chicken itself.  The queso was good as well.  A simple white queso, but it didn't have a lot of flavor either.  It needed some heat to it or maybe even some salt.  There's not a lot of options for people who don't eat beef or pork.  I know not everything can be catered to each specific person, but it would've been nice to have a couple more options.  Instead of 3 different varieties of empanadas, maybe there's 5.  Overall, this place has good food.  It could be better though, in my opinion.  It's all good, but it's not something I'd go out of my way for.",
