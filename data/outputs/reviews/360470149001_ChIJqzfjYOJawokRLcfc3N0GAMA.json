Intimate setting and attentive, efficient staff know their daily specials and are quite enthusiastic about them.  Unfortunately I could only choose one, so I can tell you that try homemade fettuccine with salmon is a hit.  My dining partner swears by the lasagne.    We are both sure that there are no bad choices to be made on this menu.  The restaurant serves wine, but does not offer beer of any kind.",

I ordered the Emilia Pie , around 8 pm. wait time was 50 minutes which is ok. After waiting an hour, our delivery driver was still waiting for our pizza, and had to wait an additional 10 minutes at the restaurant til it was ready.  fast forward getting our ONE PIE, an hour and a half later (over 30 minutes LATE): The pie was absolutely ICE cold, the toppings on the box more than the pie, and it was extremely soggy, to the point the parts of the slices towards the center of the pie had to be scraped off the bottom of the box because it wasnt fully cooked ,yet the outer crust was done well.  I've had their Emilia pizza before and it was great IN THE PAST. What we got last night was disguising to the point we threw it away because the dough wasn't cooked.  I am reasonable and can understand some things are out of your control at the restaurant like the pie getting cold en route. i wouldn't even care about that because i always reheat any pizza i get delivered, or even the topping sliding around because that could be the delivery persons fault, BUT THE DOUGH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PIE WAS RAW, SOGGY AND INEDIBLE.  You sent the pie out like that, after it not being ready after an hour. i would have rather waited longer if that meant i received food that was edible. No, i dont want to wait an hour and a half for a pie on a TUESDAY night (its not friday or saturday), but a pizzeria that sends out food like that  to their customers when its already late to a customer is adding insult to injury and honestly shows poor customer service  I'm really disappointed . so after almost 2 hours, I was still hungry, and wasted my money. On top of that, because i placed my order on Uber Eats, I couldn't even get my money back on the order.  I don't normally write a place off after one bad experience, but this one was so bad that we will.  Sad to say I  will never order from here again, and don't recommend anyone to for delivery.",

Keep that in mind, if you'd like some outdoor eating!  Delicious food and cocktails. The burrata is very tasty here and went well in their appetizer and pasta.

The owners are charming and attentive and give good advice on food and beverages, such as a delicious Primitivo wine from southern Italy that was entirely delicious and a bargain. Kids, solo diners and groups were all in place on a Friday. LOO REVIEW: A unisex facility, the toilet is not for the claustrophobic. Six feet long, with throne and sink facing each other, the space is not much wider than a coffin. Think airline toilet times two. Clean and properly supplied.",

I ended up taking half of 3/4 of it home so I could reheat/cook it in the microwave the next day. TIP: Baciccia is BYOB (bonus!).

We've ordered the polenta with gorgonzola and mushrooms as an appetizer - it came a bit different from what we are used to - the cheese was crumbled instead of a sauce, and the polenta was thick and a bit crispy on the  outside. My husband loved the combination of mushrooms on top. I ordered the pasta al pesto - it was delicious, very flavorful and my husband  got the breaded chicken - thin sliced with a crispy layer, also delicious. This restaurant is BYOB, something not very common in Park Slope. Great dinner after all, and they also let us accommodate our newborn that came in a stroller. We are definitely going back to taste the other dishes in the menu!",
