I like to at least taste the garlic in garlic mash potatoes.  The bar is not separate from the dining room which I will take note of in the future.

When we go to various theater productions we make it a point to dine in the loop at Rosebud Theater District. George is the General Manager and has always made sure we are personally taken care of. The man does know me or my family but treates us like we are his best friends and really makes Rosebud a warm and inviting place to enjoy lunch or dinner. One dish that you have to try is the Norwegian Salmon Vesuvio. The Salmon fillet is pan seared in a garlic white wine sauce and than served with roasted potato wedges and peas.
