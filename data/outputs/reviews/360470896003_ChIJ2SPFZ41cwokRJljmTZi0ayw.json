Personally, I like the rub to be just spicy enough so that you don't need and scotch bonnet sauce.  But it was cooked perfectly and their recipe makes it accessible to people who don't like spicy food.  Staff is friendly, place is clean, prices reasonable.  Would definitely go back if I lived anywhere near here!",
