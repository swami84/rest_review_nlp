The beer selection is great with many of their own brews on tap. Food wasn\u2019t anything to brag about but it was decent. The building is an awesome piece of Buffalo history. The prices were fair and service was great. I would recommend this restaurant.",

The buffet was very nice and had a good selection of food and was served hot. All of the food tasted good as well. The carver chefs were very polite and friendly. A decent selection of beers but not enough choices to include a stout beer. Flight offering was a good way to go. The back of the location had a dessert spread located near a cozy fireplace and adjacent to a game room with billiards and pinball and darts. Super chill environment with a wonderful staff. Highly recommended! Thanks you for a lovely Thanksgiving dinner!",

If you're in the business of selling alcohol, and we have to hunt you down to get more alcohol: huge problem. Food took and incredibly long time to come out, and when it did, it had been sitting out and/under a heat lamp. Half of it was cold, the other half rubbery. Our waitress smelled like cigarettes, and as someone that's worked in food industry for years, she was probably out back smoking and not giving much thought to whether her 1 TABLE wanted more booze. This is why I gave 2 stars and not 1: I think this is a severe management problem. My brother is getting married here. Everything else at the Lafayette IS WONDERFUL. But this restaurant is a blight on the Lafayette. Get it together. Yesterday. This place should be a gem, it could be turned around so easily by caring more for the staff, encouraging better behavior, encouraging CARING in general, and fixing that menu. How do you screw up pizza? This is Buffalo, all we know how to do right is eat pizza and wings and drink delicious beer. So just know that we want to love it, and want to support it, but we never ever would have stayed if one of our party members is physically unable to travel long distances, hence why eating at the hotel made the most sense. Also, this is the 2nd time we've come here, and 2nd time we've been burned. Hard.",
