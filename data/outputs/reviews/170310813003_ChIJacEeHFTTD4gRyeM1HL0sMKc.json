First, when I was ordering my food, the waiter interrupted and said in a very rude manner, \"I don't understand,\" even though I was speaking normal English. Secondly, during my dining, the waiter never came by to see if I need water or anything. Last but not least, when I finally caught a chance to speak to one of the waiters and asked for my check (because no one was coming to see if I need any service), I had to wait for half an hour to finally get my check. Their coffee and pastry are even not good. I don't know if this is only to the Asian customers. The people sitting next to me, who are white, seemed to have had a normal dining experience.",
