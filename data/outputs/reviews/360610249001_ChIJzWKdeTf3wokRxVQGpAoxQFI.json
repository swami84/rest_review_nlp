Everything tastes really mild to me and lacking in flavor and spices.  I know they are new so I hope they improve their pickling game,  spicing, and make the best sauce less sweet.  No need for maple since beets are less sweet.  I think a beet sauce more like a skordalia would be more delicious.  I think I'll try the hummus, tahini,  curry fries and jackfruit another time.  They unnecessarily included plastic ware in the to go bag and can improve on that as well to not use plastic.",

If you're not vegan they also have vegetarian options and salmon.  My boyfriend and I tried the share platter with falafel and jackfruit, the salad with vegan kofta meatballs and the curried lentil soup. Everything was delicious, falafel crisped to perfection. I was especially impressed with all their in-house sauces e.g. tahini, maple-beet tahini and the spicy cilantro schug. They also sell their delicious coffee.  If you live in the neighborhood you can order from their website directly (and avoid giving more money to Uber/Seamless etc.) They're a small business and family-owned. I'll definitely be getting some more falafel in the near future.",
