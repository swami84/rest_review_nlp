So I was standing there for a good 10-15 mins and all the workers saw me yet no one said anything. So I had to ask what to do. She said pay first then sit down. Doesn\u2019t sit right to me to have to pay first but ok. We sat down and everyone got their food before us yet they sat down after us. One couple even left after finishing their food and we still hadn\u2019t gotten our food yet. The portions were small and very overpriced. One spring roll fresh was almost 5 dollars. And although it was thick it was also short. Usually Vietnamese restaurants serve increments if 2 for that price. We only got one for 5.00. Our cups were paper cups that we had to serve ourselves at the register \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Our pho meat was raw so they tried to make pho again for us snd it was still raw after being stirred in the broth for 19 mins. The broth just wasn\u2019t hot enough so we ended up leaving. The whole experience was a bust for me and that\u2019s unfortunate cuz I LOVE PHO!!!!!! But that place just doesn\u2019t do it. Will never go back",

The 2 stars is for the broth being somewhat good, and original tasting.  Price is a huge factor, when you give extremely low amounts of portion.  I asked for extra beef, and the 4 dollar cost seemed extremely high; so I didn\u2019t go for it...good thing too. This is at most 7.99-8.99 bowl of pho, with added costs of Covid-19, etc. Your cost? 14$+, minimum 2 dollar tip (to go order)...This better be filet mignon, paper thin beef strips...seriously..unless you\u2019ve been fooling folks who haven\u2019t had a diversified choice of pho, and what you should be getting.  This was for my wife, so it was somewhat okay, but even for her small frame, the meat was seriously a joke.  You\u2019re talking 3 very, very thinly sliced pieces, paper thin; impressive knife work to cut that thin imo.. I\u2019m all for supporting local eateries, but you have to justify the price for quality/quantity.   Sadly, the quality/quantity does not warrant the price, and has been found wanting.",

Please see the photos, the red tuna was after I called to have them re-make it (you can see the insanely obvious difference in the tuna).  I cannot believe they would serve bad tuna to customers.  When I took the rolls back, they only wanted to refund me for one of them.  Then they remake the rolls and I get all the way back to my office just to notice a long black hair sticking out of one of the new rolls.  That was it for me.  I am not one to even write reviews but I felt this review was absolutely necessary given the experience.  I doubt anything will ever come of this review but I thought I should let the public know.

They are the only Vietnamese joint,   at least that I know of, here in the Tampa Bay area (I\u2019ve tried just about every one) where you can get custom summer rolls and vegan broth Pho soup. This is a great business model that I wish the owner would one day expand throughout the Tampa Bay Area and beyond.  However, my most recent visit this weekend during these ultra careful food preparation times of the Covid 19 pandemic, left me disappointed because of one individual that appeared to be the lead preparer up front that did not put on a face mask as she simultaneously prepared and talked over customer\u2019s food. I asked her why she wasn\u2019t wearing a mask like the other preparers and she responded - nicely I must add - \u201c oh we are practicing social distancing sir\u201d while she prepared my wife\u2019s meal.  In my mind I said - I should have said out loud, \u201c no you\u2019re not just practicing social distancing, you\u2019re preparing people\u2019s food, and you should be practicing sensible food preparation, like having a mask on and not talking over customer\u2019s food while your preparing it \u201c  Every other preparer in the back had on Masks.  I politely asked the preparer of my meal and that I\u2019ve known at the cafe for years, if she wouldn\u2019t mind wearing a mask as she began to prepare my meal. She eagerly obliged and I was thrilled because she makes GREAT summer rolls! But back to the preparer of my wife\u2019s meal that left me bewildered as to why she didn\u2019t want to to put on a mask. Granted I could imagine the masks are uncomfortable and annoying to wear as you prepare meals, but considering we are dealing with a highly infectious virus that is spread by microscopic droplets that occur when people talk, sneeze, and talk, this should be a no brainer! I\u2019m hopeful that this was a one off event and the next time I visit Bamboozal Cafe all food preparers will have on gloves and masks, because I really enjoy the food here and I\u2019ve been coming here to get custom summer rolls since 2011. It is one of the best if not the best Vietnamese restaurant in Tampa!",

I was urging them to try something new and they weren't satisfied either.  The staff was not very friendly. Made me hesitant to ask any questions because I was spoken to as if I was a child being reprimanded for something. The food was okay, but I do think it's a tad much to pay for the quality. I was already halfway through my meal before I got my boba drink which was Jack fruit and something else but it didn't taste like anything. It looked and tasted like blended ice with colouring and boba. After two sips, I gave up on trying to drink it. My mother and her husband got some kind of lemonade I believe but were very disappointed in the taste and price. My mother didn't even finish hers. I was very disappointed that I paid $60 for the meals because I felt like I wasted my money big time.  I attempted to use the restroom before I left. No toilet paper, nothing to dry hands, bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while, smell was horrid. I walked right out and held it until I got home. Really bad experience and will not be visiting again.",

I told her I would like to speak to another manger and she went and got Katrina. Katrina also said that it was nothing they can do about it. I suggested that they give me a 50% discount since I can\u2019t eat the soup she declined it and informed me that she don\u2019t want me back there if I don\u2019t like the food. And told me not to never come back. I asked for a to go box and started getting ready to leave and asked ratchel to write down there name she started getting up set and yelling at me and cussing me out saying she was not going to write down there names and I need to leave with an attitude. I never experienced such bad customer service and burnt food in my life. Worst experience of my life. In these pictures below you see burnt oxtails and you see how I tried to eat the oxtail and had to spit it out because it was none eatable before I informed them of anything.",

One of the biggest points of eating is taste and the pho was extremely disappointing, I've tried 2 different rolls and it was eh, the freshness of ingredients is also eh. They really need to work on their flavorings. Gave them 2 shots. I won't be eating here again unless they change this and I wish I was better informed on the pho. I actually was going to bring some back for my friend to try who never had it but it was not well flavored so I didn't, it would be not a good first pho experience. Also another big thing with pho besides the flavor is normally all of your toppings including the beef are served fresh on the side, their pho is served with the beef already in it. It made me wonder about the quality",

I was pleasantly surprised. You actually order at a counter \u201csubway\u201d style. They make your order in front of you. I wasn\u2019t very thrilled about this and found it peculiar. The interior also doesn\u2019t feel like a traditional hole in the wall Vietnamese place like I normally would go. It\u2019s modern and doesn\u2019t give off a good Vietnamese food vibe. But once they started making my food I was impressed. The spring rolls only come 1 per order but they are almost double the size of your standard roll  I ordered 2 rolls and almost couldn\u2019t finish both and my Pho. You pick the meat and then choose 4 veggie items from a very large list. Then you choose from another very long list of dipping sauce options. The Pho was surprisingly good. I would have liked a larger bowl. I added extra raw steak for an up charge. All in all I will definitely go back if I\u2019m in the downtown Tampa area again.",

I could see having a filling meal cost somewhere between $15 to $20.

My dinner companion\u2019s spring rolls were short, stubby, and tasteless with little to no filling. We suspect they were frozen foodservice in origin.  Our food was incredibly delayed to the point they offered us a free additional appetizer which we refused.  My cold noodle vermicelli (their salad) was supposed to have grilled pork. The pork was obviously steamed and was completely devoid of any seasoning. The vermicelli was absolute mush. The bottom third of the bowl had what appeared to be the water the meat had been stewed in which effectively heated the dish. Stacks of cucumber were simply thrown in as was a pretty sizable tuft of spiral cut carrots and shoots. The flavors were Vietnamese but given all the other issues it was a big letdown.  I\u2019ll reveal that I live in Arlington, VA which is home to one of the longest established and most vibrant Vietnamese communities in the US. We know great Vietnamese food - probably better than any other city. Maybe I have just as much to learn as the proprietors - which is not to eat Vietnamese food outside of the DC area.  Lastly, the bamboo clipboards they use for the bills cause the pens not to write. This is maddening and is among the many details that need more attention.  Bamboozle(d)",

The pho was not good at all.  The wife had shrimp which was very overcooked and rubbery.  The beef in mine was also very dry and overcooked.  I cannot be sure because I was not in the kitchen but it seems as if they cook the meat before they let the pho cook it.  The broth was also made with waaaaay too much cilantro (or other green leafy herb).  Every bite would have a leaf.  I am only giving a second star because of the atmosphere and their friendly attitude to dogs.  There are many good Vietnamese options in downtown Tampa, I would reccomend going to one of them instead of this place.",

Tonight, a friend and I met early to grab a bite before a show at Tampa Theatre. We both took advantage of some of the smaller options, so we could taste more.  Between the two of us, we had the bahn mi sliders, mini veggie spring rolls, traditional fresh roll, and veggie fresh roll. The food was all very fresh and delicious. My reason for four stars is the service. My friend specifically asked for peanut sauce with the spring rolls (doesn't do any fish), but it was served with usual fish sauce based sauce. Also, the server failed to notice an empty glass. This would not taint my return though.",

For the main course I had the beef tips which for $18.95 was not worth it to me, the flavor was IMO just shy of a great. My jasmine rice had too much nonstick spray on the surface of the portion bowl so the top was dingy yellow, the warm plate and hardened top was a telltale sign of too much time in the expo window. The kicker of the evening was not being able to get a cr\u00eape on the side, the only way to get this was to purchase an entirely separate entr\u00e8e. This was ran by a manager and owner. It makes sense to not accommodate to one guest when you already do so well I suppose. On a good note even though the sake was warmed non traditionally it was done to a near perfect temperature thus preserving it's essence.
