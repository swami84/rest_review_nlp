The street corn we ordered was brought out hot, sat in front of us and we were told the other food would be right out....We had no plates or napkins and were left staring and waiting while it was getting cold. Finally after about 10 minutes we decided just to eat it as we wondering at that point if we were getting anything else. The staff seemed liked busy bees doing everything except paying attention to customers. The food did come right after that but again, it's just flopped down in front of us. No plates and only the 2 napkins that we had to ask for. The tacos were good but small. I understand limiting interactions because of covid, but even at a food truck you get better service. If this rating were just on the food and drinks then i would give it a 4 out of 5, and same for atmosphere. The service leaves much to be desired.....",

The first thing I noticed was the d\u00e9cor. Loved the natural wood touches especially the woven basket light fixtures. It felt nautical but also upscale so I thought the prices were going to be astronomical but folks I was wrong. The tacos were only $2.50 to $3.50 each and the cocktails average about $10. Sweet!  I started with the Smoke on The Water cocktail for $10. It was superb. Smoky and not watered down at all. As far as tacos, I went for the Baja Fish, Glazed Pork Belly, Roasted Duck and Portobello tacos. Every single one left me wanting more. So much flavor and they were made fresh. Even the taco shells melted like butter. Since the tacos were that good, I added a side Duck Quesadilla for $7. OMG. This was absolutely delicious but wish it was a little bigger. The best part was this feast only cost me $31 including the cocktail.  So in a nutshell, I'm definitely coming back for more. Besides the amazing food, the service I received was also on point. My server took the time to explain the different tacos they offer and how to order from the menu card. She also checked up on me often to make sure I'm satisfied. And I was, so see you soon Bar Taco. You just gained loyal customer :)",

The waiter was trying to patiently explain everything and then exchange what in the end turned not to what you expected.  Salad plate was ok size.  Tacos are tiny.  For me the big deal was unexpected sauces in the dishes.  They were not mentioned in the menu, but were in the dish.  Or for example I was told that Brussels taco compared to portobello weren\u2019t  hot, but they were.  In general cute place with outside and inside areas, polite service and very confusing menu.

It had avocado and tortilla chips. The baja fish taco was the best taco of all and I'd definitely have that again next time. The salsa verde chicken taco was all right, but the carnitas taco was quite greasy. The churros were also not as crunchy/crispy as I hoped either for dessert. Nevertheless, the service and ambience was great and I'd definitely go back for the salad and baja fish taco!",

My friend and I both had to call out of work. The next day I managed to drag myself to Walgreens to get charcoal capsules, and decided to call the restaurant to let them know what happened. I spoke to a female manager, let her know when I was in, what we had, and her first response was that she hadn't heard of anyone else being ill. I simply asked her to ask the kitchen manager to check the temps on the cooler and she said she would, and reiterated that no one else had been sick. Ma'am: You're getting a complaint now, and my friend and I didn't magically get ill simultaneously. The apathy just upset me. I won't be back.",

        "caption": "I\u2019ve heard such amazing things about the bartaco in Tampa. So when we visited Miami before our cruise this past week, I was so excited to try this out. But from start to finish, I have to say that this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. I\u2019m not sure the best way to start, so I\u2019ll just list what happened in order. 1. Our server (Katrina) did not greet us for quite a while after sitting. When we were greeted, it wasn\u2019t friendly, she never even said her name. We got it from the receipt. She asked if it was our first time at the restaurant, we said it was, she explained how to use the write-in menu. 2. We begin writing in our menus, and I ask about how the bowls are made, if I could do different toppings, etc. I specifically asked, \u201cWhich bowl do you prefer, the chicken or the duck?\u201d And she says the duck, so I take her recommendation. 3. She takes our order cards, and we wait. It\u2019s busy, so we anticipated waiting for the food for a bit. But we are waiting, and waiting, and our server does not come back. We are out of water for the table, no refills, but she\u2019s checking on the table next to us. We finally are able to wave her down and ask for refills, she sets a new water vase on our table without a word. 4. Another server finally comes out to our table with plates of food. Three out of four of us are offered the correct plates, then she asks if I had the tuna bowl. I said I did not, I ordered the duck. Two of the people in our party are missing rice, one is missing beans. 5. Our server returns, brings a side of beans and says that she rang in the wrong bowl and is having the kitchen expedite my bowl so it should be out ASAP. My friend orders a side of corn, and the server said it will be about ten minutes since it\u2019s a new order. We say that\u2019s fine, and remind her about the missing rice. 6. We wait a solid fifteen minutes, and our server never returns. Finally another server runs the corn out, and we say thanks, we are still waiting on two sides of rice. She must have told our server because Katrina comes to our table, literally drops the two bowls on the table without a word, turns and leaves before I can ask about my missing bowl. 7. At this point it has been another fifteen minutes and my entire party has finished eating, and I still have no bowl. Katrina is passing the table (she still has not made an effort to engage with us since bringing the rice) and I ask her to please just pack my meal to go, since I won\u2019t want to keep my party waiting while I eat. She says okay and that she will discount the meal for me. 8. After a while longer, someone else brings out my to go bag, then Katrina comes with the check, and says she took my meal off completely, which is nice but honestly was pretty expected at that point. But one thing to note about bartaco is that she specifically told us in the beginning to use one order sheet per check. So that is what we did, we had three order sheets. But when she brings the check, it\u2019s all combined together. So now we have to ask her to separate it. You\u2019d think we asked her to rip off her own arm with the attitude she gave us when we asked. Reluctantly she did separate it, drops the bills (literally) on the table, then comes back when we have cards out. After running the cards, she drops them again and leaves without saying anything. No apology, no have a good evening, nothing. Even her chef and manager never came by to apologize. 9. To top everything off, the to go box lid did not fit the bowl, so they never even sealed the box when packing it up.  What makes me sad is that the food (once I actually was able to eat it at the hotel) was absolutely delicious. I am hoping the Tampa location is better when I gather the nerve to try it out.",

If you have been to other bartaco locations you know there decor always makes you feel like you on a holiday. I love how each bartaco has artwork representing the area they are in like this one. The food and drinks are the same as the other locations I loved. Was so happy they had the bartaco chef from other locations train the kitchen in Aventura. Overall, bartaco life/vibe are consistent. I will a raise a glass of fresh made margaritas to bartaco Aventura.",
