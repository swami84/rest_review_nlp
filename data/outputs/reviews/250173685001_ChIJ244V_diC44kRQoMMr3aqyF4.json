It is finally open again and this is great! This building housed the Moody Lounge from the late 1960th for 40 years. Moody Lounge was pretty popular back then - it had decent local live music in the 1970s. Then it became Robert\u2019s Restaurant around 1999. Robert's Restaurant and Bar closed in 2011 and Stadium Sports Bar & Grill was opened. The name was altered to Playmakers Bar and Grill in 2013 after a change in ownership. I guess this place has some historical value for Waltham.  P.S. We visited this place recently. Under new ownership  it is much much  better than it used to be. Food is delicious. The idea of sliders is awesome. I would recommend to start with a slider tower so you can taste different sliders for only $20. The selection of craft beers on draft is quite impressive as well. I am glad that this place is now A+ local bar.",

I was able to try two different sandwiches - fried chicken and a juicy lucy, Both were fantastic! Shared onion strings, which were really great. I love that they carried the slider theme into dessert. We had the churro sliders, which were delicious. Only suggestion would be to include some wetnaps - as the icecream was a bit messy! Beer selection was good, included some local Mighty Squirrel beers. Plenty of TVs so that no matter where you sit you have a view, but wasn't overwhelming. Renovations in the bar area looks great, bathrooms not as much. But everything was clean!",

Nachos and pulled pork sandwich are great too. Good beers on tap. Open and light atmosphere. 15+ tvs, will put on what you want. Very neighborhoody and welcoming. Definitely go!",

We sat down and the manager took our order. The appetizer came out quick but tasted like blah (mozzarella sticks). After waiting an eternity my fish and chips came out. Coleslaw was ok, fries ok, fish not so much. 90% breading, 10% crumbly fish. Still waiting on my co workers pretzels and ranch. I'm done eating and we are both out of water. thinking about asking for the check in case they need to make the paper to print it on.
