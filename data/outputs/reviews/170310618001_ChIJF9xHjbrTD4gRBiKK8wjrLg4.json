Being so busy after just opening back up after not being able to have dine in for a long time they were busy. But things were running well. Unfortunately our dishes were undercooked or still frozen. We mentioned to the waiter we just wanted to pay for our drinks and we were just going to head out. Again, they were busy and we didn\u2019t want to cause fuss. The owner came out and told us we weren\u2019t going anywhere. He prepared us two pasta dishes off the menu himself. Had more drinks brought out to us and after served us champagne and tiramisu. We asked for none of that but we\u2019re SO extremely grateful. Our night wouldn\u2019t have been ruined if we had to eat at home. I work in the service industry. I know how it was to open back up after being closed for months. Being treated with such kindness and care was one of the greatest dining experiences we both have had. I love this place and will always go here and recommend it to anyone.",

When I called about it they said they had changed it on their menu but when I checked on their website guess what still says the old recipe so not only was it not right the person answering the phone straight up lied to me about it.

I was so excited to finally come here as I thought this was a fairly upscale Italian dining place.  Wrong.  We weren't shown to our table, just told to sit \"over there\" in the corner near the window.  Had to ask TWICE for menus.  When I asked about one of the wines, the server told me he didn't know, he doesn't drink wines, then just stared at me instead of trying to find someone to answer my question. We were repeatedly waiting and looking for the server for drinks and food and the check and boxes.  The bus boys wore jeans shorts and backwards baseball hats (fine for some places, but not at l what I was expecting).  Absolutely will not be coming here again.  Two stars instead of one because maybe it would have been better if I knew it wasn't a nice place ahead of time.",

Our waiter Art was amazing and made the celebration extra special.  Thank you so much for all of your hard work.  We will come back to have brunch with you again.  When our two hours was up, a lady named Debra approached our table and explained that even though she previously told us we could pay with a credit card, we couldn't anymore because the system wasn't secure.  When I asked for more information, she became extremely unprofessional and aggressive.  All I wanted to know was (a) what she meant when she told us the system wasn't secure and (b) how much money to get from the ATM.  She banged her hands on the table in front of our party of 15 and threatened to call 911.  It was out of control.  After 3 glasses of champagne, I was not drunk but instead I was deeply offended by her wildly inappropriate assumptions and assertions.  All of that aside, I approached the manager after Debra ruined our celebration, because I still needed to know how much cash to take out.  He was very helpful and helped me manage the situation.  Thank you for remaining calm and logical.  I appreciated that.",

The space was crowded, and seemed like it would typically be cosy, however during brunch it was as loud as a middle school cafeteria.  I also let the waiter know that I was dairy free, and he confirmed the dish I was ordering was dairy free, but I ended up having a reaction to the food.

We went there because I remembers that I really enjoyed one dinner with a friend a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, this time it was a completely different experience! 1. Dishwashers kept slamming the dishes in the kitchen, they were super loud! One patron went in to ask them to be more gentle with the dishes, and it still didn't help. 2) we ordered mussels, they smelled like.. barn? pee? I always order mussels whenever they are on the menu, and something was wrong with these ones. A couple at the table next to ours also had mussels, and they didn't complain though (trying to be objective.) 3) Burrata - it's not the creamy kind that I expected, but a regular mozzarella from Jewel. 4) Salmon Pasta - the pasta was very pale, with a blah texture, the sauce was watery and left sour aftertaste, salmon was terribly overcooked and dry. 5) duck.. they didn't trim excess fat as they should have, the dish lacked flavor. My fiance had salmon as his main course, and it was, once again, dry. The place was half-empty, and still they were very slow with everything. We got there at 7, and we only got to eat at 8 (by that time we  only had caprese, and we had to send the mussels back.) 6) One of the busboys was snacking while cleaning the tables - literally walking with a plate of food, and chewing. He didn't seem to care about his job at all. The whole experience was so amusing and ridiculous, that we decided not to cancel our order after the mussels fiasco, but hope for the best and see what else was going to go wrong. We were barely able to hold down laughter when they brought pasta and main plates. It was just ridiculous! The food was SO plain, we rated it as \"one step above cafeteria food.\" We decided to leave and finish the night at our beloved Mia Francesca a few blocks away. We had the real burrata there, and had their delicious cheesecake and chocolate chip cookie with cinnamon gelato. One good thing about Angelina (well, two!) - the waiter, the bartender and the water busboy were very good. I've never written a review like this before, but this time I felt like I absolutely had to. I truly hope that you have a better experience when you go there.",

What I do not understand is why we were directed to stand in the middle of everything while we waited rather than truly off to the side. The host put us right in the path of the servers. It was too hot, too cramped, and too loud. Music was ridiculous - I love EDM and all that stuff, but not blasting at brunch. Coffee refills were far and few between, which was a blessing and a curse since the coffee was not very good, but I was quite tired. Food was fine but the preparation of the lox plate, while aesthetically pleasing, was impractical for actually eating the food. Onions cut up too finely. Cherry tomatoes rolling all over the place. Like seriously what am I supposed to do with that? I don't wanna chase down my food on my own plate! Won't be returning. The friends I went with had a much better time than I did. Seems like an OK place, but not good for the 25 going on 65 crowd.",

We did finish with a chocolate bread pudding that was a bit sweet but was very very good.  The ambience of this place however, is excellent. It feels like a little quaint place in the west village, not a lot of space , but you don't feel like you're on top of each other, it just feels cozy.

The bread pudding is amazing and will keep you coming back for more. The facilities are very cramped but cozy. If you are clausterphobic, don't come here and it's a bit overwhelming but the food is good.",

They have legitimate Italian food and a great wine selection- the smell of garlic, tomato, and mushroom hits you when you walk in. They also offer a great and affordable brunch on Sundays- amazing eggs florentine! You cannot go wrong with the chicken marsala or lasagna- solid Italian classics.",
