Today Tuesday 16 at 9:50 pm I bought a pizza called \"Famous Original\" ($ 20) plus pepperoni as a topic ($ 5), the place is comfortable and quiet even the people  They look friendly however the taste of the pizza was unpleasant and disappointing, for this small size of pizza it cost me \"27 $\" (tax included), they only included 10 pieces of pepperoni and it cost me 5 $!  Amazing!  They  should add more pepperoni and improve their ingredients since the cheese, the sauce and the dough is not good (I heard that the ingredients are imported from Italy but .. I doubt that it is from there) trust me I tried many pizzas from different places of manhattan and queens and also I have tried many times the 1$ pizzas of manhattan and I can say that those $ 1 pizzas are better, they have a good flavor, the dough, the cheese, the sauce, but this place \"Roberta\" ... disappoints me.  I hope it is the last time I buy here in this place, it is not pleasant to spend 27 dollars for this poor quality of pizza, I hope they can improve.  The pizza box does not have any logo, it is very basic.  This is my opinion and I just want to let you all know what a customer thinks about this pizza since I understand that other people may say that it is the best pizza, but you have to be realistic with the quality and cost of pizza. (They only assept cards, not cash) Thanks",

We bought pies and eaten by the waterfront benches before. Last night they were open for indoor dinning. We plan to try everything on their menu. Bee Sting, Famous Original and Lil' Stinker are all delicious. Bee Sting balances savory with honey's sweetness and a nice kick from the chili. And the dough is baked just right.",
