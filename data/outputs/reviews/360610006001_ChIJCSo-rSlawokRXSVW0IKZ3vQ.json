We love Malaysian food, and yet their menu and dishes on various tables looked uninspiring, so we only got drinks from here. A chocolate malt and a ginger with brown sugar. While waiting, we got a cup of water from the pitcher they have out....it was sink water, and this made me wonder if there is a difference between bathroom sink water and kitchen sink water, but this was definitely unfiltered bathroom water.  Anyhow, we both wanted to return our drinks, they barely had any flavor to them. Mine tasted like water, and I didn't taste any ginger or brown sugar...so they redid it and unfortunately, it didn't taste any better. 2 small cups of badly flavored water named something else for $8+  The staff seemed ok.... The atmosphere was nice. Nothing stood out. Oh, but I did add a star because they use paper straws instead of plastic straws. I love that...is it worth coming back for...sadly, no.",

This is my brutally honest review. I had the nasi lemak which had too many fried anchovies, peanuts and cucumbers to count. The sambal was barely enough nor was it tasteful. I also ordered the otak-otak as a side dish which was completely bland with a tinge of a weird sour taste. My barley drink was tasteless, nothing special nor worth buying. The dishes honestly lacked in soul, it didn\u2019t have the flavours and spices of Malaysia.  To my fellow Malaysians, please do not waste your money by trying this so called kopitiam because it won\u2019t reach the standards of our food culture back home. It is true the restaurant is often packed but I realised it was usually filled with Americans or foreigners (non-Malaysians) who seemed to either never tried Malaysian cuisine or have been there for business or pleasure once before and assumed it is at par to the standards of my home country.  Don\u2019t waste your time unless you\u2019re expecting disappointment and a decrease in your bank account that you will never get back.",

As I was really craving Malaysian food, I had not eaten earlier and was expecting something mildly satisfying. I was not expecting much as I know it is difficult to produce an authentic version of the meal here. However, this one took it down multiple levels as their Nasi Lemak was so so wrong. The main thing about the Nasi Lemak is the Sambal (the red sauce). First of all, it tastes nothing like it at all. It does not even come close. It tasted more like sambal belacan (which is different from sambal nasi lemak) than anything else. Secondly, it was SOOOOO little. They served the sambal in a tiny cup (x2 smaller than the ketchup cup served in McD's) and when asked for extra, you had to pay for it. So kedekut (stingy), NONESENSE! Sambals are usually given in generous amounts if you ever come to Malaysia (or go to other Malaysian restaurants in the US). The meal was really disappointing (To say disappointing does not actually cut it for me). I also ordered the Soya drink but I dont want to get on that much. It was obvious they bought the Yeo's kotak(box) drink, poured half of it in and watered it down to save cost. I believe they wanted to cut costs all around but I dont think it should be at the expense of quality. If you want to try authentic (relatively closer) to Malaysian food, you should go to Rasa near Washington St Park instead. I  am not sponsored by them or anything, I am just a Malaysian who has been living in the US for abit and know the difference. Apa ni, so meh only. The place was clean and cosy though.",

        "caption": "I ordered the Pan Mee noodles and pandan beverage...  The noodles were not fresh, the dough was very yellow and didn't rise making the the noodles very flat tasting. There was no bounce texture to the noodles at all. The soup was ok, fried anchovies were nice but that's it.  The pandan beverage had 2.5 pandan leaves in the package. That is extremely excessive knowing that pandan is a very strong flavor. When you keep the pandan leaves in the bag for too long there is a residual taste to it. Think about steeping Jasmine Green Tea for too long, that's the flavor and aftertaste. Not good.  Going to clean up my table, I noticed that others also didn't finish their food and they were just throwing away like me. Would love to know their thoughts on the quality of the meal as well.  Overall pretty disappointed, as a fellow Malaysian I had a lot of hopes in this place \ud83d\ude14",

Both are super flavorful and filling. Also, don\u2019t forget to try their drinks!

Ordered their Nasi Lemak only to be disappointed by both the taste and portion of their sambal. The sambal tasted nothing like the sweet and spicy condiment that any Malaysian would expect, just blended onion, garlic, and chili. Besides that, the sambal that they provided didn't even fill up half the small ketchup paper cup that contained it, and I was told that it would cost an additional 90 cents to get more sambal! Since when are Malaysians known for being stingy? I tried to look for soy sauce to salvage what I could of that abomination, only to find that they don't even provide soy sauce at the table! Granted, this place is new, but that is no excuse for such an appalling misrepresentation of Malaysian food and culture. If you're looking for legitimate Malaysian food in the US, just save your money for somewhere else. However, if you're just looking for overpriced, mediocre food, by all means go ahead.",

The iced kopi -- which I've never had before -- was really yummy, slightly toastier in my opinion and less sweet than a Vietnamese iced coffee, which I absolutely loved. Perfect for a sweltering New York City day. The cold sesame noodles were just bursting with nutty, spicy flavor, and the noodles themselves were lucious and fat and amazing to chew through. The chicken wings were crispy and salty and perfect when paired with the salted egg yolk side. And the purple rice wrapped in pandan leaf with kaya jelly was a delight -- the kaya jelly had an awesome coconut flavor and was thick without being lumpy or tasting like corn starch.  I can't wait to come back to NYC and try out the kaya toast and all the amazing desserts on the menu, not to mention the nasi lamek and Hainan chicken rice!",

The coffee is also brilliant for my fellow caffeine heads; don't be shy to try Kopitiam's cultural take on sweetness and flavor!  The other dishes my friends had also seemed great. The prawn noodles looked flavorful and the mushroom dish I tried a bite of (you'll know which one it is) was absolutely brilliant in presentation and taste.

I have walked by this little Malaysian cafe a few times but never stopped until last weekend's Friday when I really needed to sit dow somewhere to relax a bit and let me tell you this place was just what I needed. The prices are very good, the food was tasty and the service was amazing, such a friendly and kind team. Bathrooms were very clean and the overall music and decoration of the place invited me to come back to read a book, work a bit on my computer or sit down with a good friend. The place is just great, Loved the casava and coconut milk cake \ud83e\udd70.",

The food offerings here really are special and I am real eager to try more of them.  I do wish that the menu could be better organized.

It\u2019s fine when it functions as a cafe but as a restaurant, it\u2019s inefficient and chaotic which unfortunately seems to affect what\u2019s most important- the consistency of the food. The pricing also doesn\u2019t justify the quality.  I\u2019ve been here a few times and but most likely won\u2019t return.",

The pan mee is amazing, among top 3 soups I've had in my NYC life. The broth is light, filled with umami from the mushroom and anchovies, but without being salty. Then, the hand torn noodle balances everything, with the right al dente texture and freshly made taste that complements the crunchiness of anchovies. Basically, if you go here, you should try the ban mee as your first entree here, along with a couple of sides (for example, the shrimp paste wings are amazing). Then perhaps come back and work your way through the menu.",

The Nasi Lemak was good even though the anchovies did not really taste that authentic but I must say the Nasi (rice) was very good. The Pandan Chicken was however a disappointment.  Instead of using chicken with bones that is how I always had it before minced chicken was used. I had one bite of it and felt directly that something was wrong with it. My wife tried it as well and agreed with me so we called the waiter to explain that we did not think this was the real thing and we wanted to send it back. Here I must say the restaurant was 100% authentic. Instead of accepting this and taking away the 6 dollars from the bill he said that \"he can't take it away as we had already dug into it and that he would throw all of it away\". He offered us a dessert or drink instead...disappointed from an American perspective but it really gave the place a Malaysian touch. The Pan Mee came in about 10 minutes later and was quite good and up to my liking even though the 1 dollar dish in Malaysia would beat this one. After the meal you are expected to clean your table and clean up. This felt like an insult as we already tipped up when paying the bill. If I go back I will make sure to save the tip until after eating so I can adjust it to what I think would be appropiate.",

        "caption": "I mostly chose this place because it was close to an internet cafe my little brother needed to go to, but I'm glad I did!  I ordered the Lobak, Pulut Panggang, Oh Chien, shrimp soup, Bandung, some sesame drink, and some type of coffee (this was my bro, so not sure which coffee it was).  The Lobak is very delicious.  Despite being fried, it wasn't oily at all.  Instead, it was tender on the inside, very juicy and a nice salty-meaty-sweet.  It actually reminds me a little of Chinese lionhead meatballs in terms of flavor...but definitely not as strong flavored and much less saucy.  The Pulut Panggang was more subtly flavored and a close second.  The rice and filling were aromatic and very nicely perfumed by the banana leaf.  Be sparing with the sauce/paste here...too much and it will overpower the rice and filling.  My main was the Oh Chien.  The egg was somehow fluffy and sticky at the same time.  I think it was the seafood sauce that did this...it was partially the texture of soft glutinous rice.  I enjoyed it, especially the pockets of tender oyster inside.  I can't speak to the shrimp soup (my brother's), but all in all, it was very enjoyable.  My suggestion for interested folks would ve to get there prior to noon.  We arrived at 11:30ish, and it was nice and fairly empty.  By the time we finished (12:20) it was packed.  So packed, we had to maneuver to get out.  5/5...and I will be returning in the future.  My little bro also enjoyed it (he says his coffee was really good), and he plans to bring his gf next time she's feeling homesick and wants Malaysian/Singaporean food.  Additional notes: Quick food prep, CC accepted, however they run out of certain menu items so come with backups in mind.  Also, the \"snack\" items are fairly large and filling ( we couldn't finish our mains), so plan accordingly.",

The focus is small plates of snacks and noodle bowls that show off Peranakan cuisine, the rich mixing of Chinese and Malay culture that has happened in Malaysia for decades. Like a storage unit or a basement, it seems the extra space finds a way to get filled quickly, as more customers are coming and Kopitiam continues to burst at its seams during popular hours.",

Clearly the restaurant locates their budget mainly on its website, photos and advertising + PR campaign. The deco is ok, waiters are politely unfamiliar with waiting and most importantly the food is shameful. My bowl is covered with mediocre premade fried preserved fish, a few slice of mediocre cucumber, and a half mediocre boiled egg over a mediocre steamed rice which an 8 year old can learn how to make it in 10 minutes. Go get some real authentic Chinese/Malaysian food where packed by older generation in Chinatown instead of here. Fortunately there are plenty",

The traditional penang white coffee ($5; credit accepted) is a potent pick-me-up in a deceptively sweet, deceptively soothing, package. And you can get it iced. Hungry? Get the nasi lemak, coconut rice with eggs, cucumber, anchovies, and a tangy homemade sambal sauce.  Thank goodness Kopitiam moved to a new location, it's now a legit date spot. With seating.",
