Once I left this this job, I became a regular customer here. After experiencing discrimination in Serbia for being GAY, I found myself a new home here because my boss and my coworkers were very supportive to me and brought me in as a family member.  I regularly brought in my group of gay friends and they, too, love the quality of food!  We were always treated with great respect and excellent customer service.  We always felt at home here!  I live in Miami now and every time I go to Chicago I make sure to go back along with my friends for  a deliscious meal and amazing time. You can expect a high level of respect and excellent customer at the best Serbian restaurants in Chicago, 016!  Definitely recommend, definitely LGBTQ FRIENDLY and wish all luck to my 016 FAMILY! \u2764\ufe0f",

Unfortunately, even today there are evil and envious people who engage in dirty deeds. Such as hiring people who have never been to this restaurant to post negative fictional comments and give low ratings. An example is the last five negative comments. I think it is very primitive and evil. I am someone who is very satisfied with the food and service in this restaurant. I visit them at least once a week. My favorite dish is Braised veal, and I live beer Lav. Beet salad is great! The service is fast and the staff is very nice! As for the bad people, I think everyone will end up getting what they deserve.  016, I wish you all the best!!!",

Meat is excellent, not spicy, no crazy spices, just an excellent selection of well seasoned & prepared meat! They bake all of their bread daily in house and smoke the meats in house. The platter is definitely enough for 4 people and gives you an amazing selection of all of their meats! Burek takes a bit of time to cook, but is also fantastic. The staff is extremely friendly (we had a long conversation with the owner and chef) and knowledge with their favorites on the menu, especially if you\u2019re looking to try something new. Excellent liquor and cocktail menu as well. You don\u2019t have to pay for quality as quality is part of the experience! Cannot wait to go back and bring all of my friends! A must try and easily new favorite. Thank you 016 & see you very soon!",

The cooks and grill masters from this south Serbian  town are known for their near mythological ability to get more flavor into their meats and their secrets have been passed down to the next generation. One of the next generation is Bojan, chef and co-owner of 016(area code of the famed Leskovac town). My third visit now and first time not ordering of the grill menu. Went with a goulash. Traditionally Hungarian dish adopted into Serbian cuisine through it's northern regions. Getting a south Serbian take on it was intriguing and very rewarding. Perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection - I would absolutely recommend. Now I just have to go back for some U\u0161tipci. Another item I must highlight is the Head cheese or Pihtije in serbian. Best I've had and that's knowing my mother will probably see this. Traditional serbian dish of bone marrow garlic and salt was elevated with delicious tender beef at the bottom and lightened with some citrus notes. Absolutely delightful.

All were simply delicious!! We were blown away by the elegant tast of the Cabbage salad and ordered 2 orders. Each dish was beautifully prepared and served, similar to many high end restaurants in River North/West Loop. Serving sizes are amply and more than enough for one person or perfect to share. Service is quick, constant and everyone was so nice! Kept our water glasses full and provided french fries to our picky toddler.  We were so impressed we booked a table for upcoming Easter celebrations.  Highly recommend for any Serbians and non-Serbs, even if you are vegetarian!!",

I have eaten at Kiko\u2019s prior to ownership change a few times, and I have nothing bad to say about the food previously, but since 016 took over, I often find myself going out of my way to eat there (other Balkan restaurants are much closer to me). My wife and I go there at least once a month.  The atmosphere is very welcoming. I feel comfortable bringing people there who are not from the Balkans so they can taste our delicious cuisine, and 016 does a great job of plating the dishes they way you would expect of a high end restaurant.  Also, kudos to the bartenders for creating cocktails from rakija (traditional Balkan spirit). I have not found another place in Chicago that does this!  Great job so far!

I can finally say (and take friends) to a place that proudly servers traditional Serbian cuisine. A restaurant that knows its tradition and takes pride expressing it in each plate served. If you are looking to have a \u201cbite\u201d of the Balkans, don\u2019t hesitate to make your way to the best Serbian restaurant in town..",

Even the servers are giving you an attitude if you dont leave them more than 20% of tips. Muckalica tastes and looks like someone throw up And when I told the server they actually gave me an attitude, can\u2019t force me to eat something thats not good.  Never again !!",
