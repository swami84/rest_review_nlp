I had gotten the lettuce wraps when I was here, but they weren't worth paying over $10 to bite into small wraps that I could have made at home. I hope they adjust their prices to their cuisine, especially considering that Dua is right up the road. If you want modern cuisine and to try something new, this could be a good spot, but keep in mind your wallet when eating here.",

I placed my order before a lot of others who came in yet their orders were done ahead of mine because the drink makers grabbed the cups at random instead of a first come first serve basis. Personally, I think this place would benefit greatly from a uniform system that works on a first come first serve basis prioritizing call-ins. but again, you can't beat the ambience & the employees seem happy to be there & it shows in the service.",

The staff was kind and patient as we read over the new menu and they made suggestions, too! My friend and I shared jasmine green milk tea, pork buns & chicken dumplings. Everything was delicious! A neon photo mural on the wall caught my eye, so I asked Alex, who turned out to be the manager/ co-owner. He told me it's of some old Korean & Chinese buildings. All three of us then talked about our mutual love of food and culture for a while. We were able to get our paws on a few new versions of their teas. The lychee, matcha, Thai tea, taro, and green apple are just a few of their new creations. Our favorites were the green apple and the lychee flavors, which were lightly sweet and very refreshing. Final statement: We will be back & referring.",
