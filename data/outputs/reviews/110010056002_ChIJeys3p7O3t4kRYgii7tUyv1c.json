Our main dishes were the scallops and tuna tartare.  The scallops dish was a little light on the portions with only 4 scallops, while the portions for the tuna tartare dish were just right for my date.  The manager or owner named Keith came around to check on us and engaged us in some polite small talk.  He was seeking a partner for a fishing weekend in NJ and overheard me talking to my date about swordfish.  Very nice guy.  Our waitress was utterly efficient and polite as well.

However the actual palate experience was overall disappointing. The duck spring rolls were good. However the fried green tomato tasted like fried thick breading with a very bland sauce on top. The salmon entree did not work at all. Bacon and salmon should not be served together in the same dish. Both are fatty and there was nothing in the dish to balance this out. The smoked bacon overpowered the delicate flavor of the salmon and everything else in the dish. The service was good and they were very attentive in getting us served in time to see our show at the Kennedy Center.  They had nice options but need to work on the delivery for the taste buds.",
