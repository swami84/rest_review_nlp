Well lit outdoor seating but might be too cold to do that now. Love the indoor decor! Got my food to go; fast and efficient service. I think I waited about 15 minutes for my order. Cash and credit cards accepted. In my opinion, not the best pho. The noodle strands were rather thin and broken. The beef pieces seemed small too. Loved the Vietnamese coffee and pork over rice.",

        "caption": "*update: For such a trying time for a food lover, like now, Pho 60 is a good choice. Andy has taken steps and time to make his restaurant a comfortable and safe place to eat. The tables are very comfortable distanced, they have plenty of ventilation, the location is quiet and not crowded, there's hand sanitizer aplenty, and the staff is fully masked. The above is very nice, especially at night, with strings of lights and music playing. The food was good before but now it has gotten even better. Good job Andy!  I haven't had a chance to try the rest, and I can't say that I know what authentic vietnamese food is, but I can say that I've eaten a lot of New York Viet food, and the broth here definitely taste a lot cleaner. Based on the other reviews, I can't wait to go back for some dessert, pork chops and bo luc lac. Regarding, the 1 star review for a shake, I think that's a bit of a overreaction. She should go back and try the food before giving them only 1 star, c'mon! *edit: I forgot to comment on the atmosphere. The atmosphere here is a much needed change then the 8th avenue Chinatown. The restaurant is clean, decor is upscale, and I heard that the owner renovated himself to ensure it was done right.  Update: i went back and tried the crab soup. Really good! And, they have a cotton candy machine for the kids.",

Staff (and probably owner) did not speak Vietnamese at all. Nonetheless, we gave it a try and ordered the pho dac biet. Gotta give credit to them for the effort they put in making the pho. It was a really good try with all the garnishes and sides (lime, bean sprouts, herbs, hoison sauce, chili sauce, etc). Knocked off a few stars due to how fatty the broth was (it left a layer of fat on our lips) and our briskets arrived well done when normally it should be somewhat raw. Kudos to the friendly waitress though.",

Pho 60 on the other hand, has a spacious and inviting decor. I'll be honest, their regular Pho (beef) is lacking flavor..but don't come here for that...

The chicken curry is extremely spicy nowadays and I liked it more way back when they used to make it borderline sweet. The spring rolls are extremely crispy and have a nice, tasty filling. The broth for various noodles are flavorful and cooked well. Also! They regularly serve banh beo, which I rarely see around NYC. It's a little rice pudding with mung bean and shrimp threads (if I recall), served with fish sauce and it's my absolute favorite dish from the time I went to Vietnam! They make it quite well here and, when it's freshly steamed and served, it's absolutely amazing! I highly recommend anyone who hasn't tried it before to come here and give it a taste.",

There is one guy who seems to be the owner, walked around and asked other people how their meal was except my table. Another time I came here, there was a line and I was next however, I guess one of his friends came and he gave them the table first. Which is fine I guess.

No way, this place is just around the corner of my child's weekend school. Lunch after school? Yes way.  I really loved the Shrimp Paste Noodles. Lots of toppings. Broth is in a lovely colored pink, very shimpy, indeed. I went for their Pho60 Special Noodles (I'm guessing the big bowl?), no complains. Their spring rolls were just ok, not enough meat, or maybe just too much fillers. Pork Chops were packed with flavor and tender in texture. Prices and portions are decent.  The interior is quite nice, decor has a garden feel and I just can't get over their beautiful floral tea sets. Food came quick. Waitstaff were nice but service could use a little more organization.",

It's away from the busy intersections of 8th Avenue and just removed from Fort Hamilton. It's great because you do not have to deal with the crowds of people to get to it.  Interior: The place was definitely remodeled after the previous dessert shop closed down. Everything was redone and nothing seemed used or worn down. Most importantly the place felt clean along with their \"A\" grade health inspection.  Food: I have yet to find the best Vietnamese food place in New York since I moved here. I have tried places on 8th Avenue (Sunset Park), Chinatown (Manhattan), 86th Street (Bay Ridge), and Bensonhurst. From complete and horrible letdowns to passable, this place beats them all. One word, 'Fresh'. Nothing tasted old or have been sitting too long. I got pho (beef noodle soup) and a sinh to bo (Avocado shake). Pho and its broth are the most important factors for me before we even add anything else. This broth was the clearest yet. It was not fatty and didn't have a Chinese beef broth flavor. It was not the best I ever had, but far superior to many places I have been to. The noodles were cooked just right and the beef was great tasting too. There was not as much meat as I have previously encountered at other places, but I'm glad the quality holds up. My avocado shake was also delicious. Not too sweet, fresh avocado, and THICK.  Service: The waitresses were nice and were able to provide good service. My only issue was the lack of English. It was hard to communicate what I exactly wanted, like a soup spoon specifically for the pho and not a standard metal spoon. I got the right spoon eventually, but the language barrier was evident.",
