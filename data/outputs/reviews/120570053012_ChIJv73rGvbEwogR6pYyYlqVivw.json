I had their chicken fajita salad, which was very filling for a salad.  Good selection of draft beer and mixed drinks, a few TVs fit into the relaxed atmosphere.  There is outside seating with umbrellas but it was way too hot for that.",

While yes, the service was slow and the food lagged to come out, she was the only server on and had every single seat full inside, outside, and at the bar.  It was the day after Gasparilla, and brought in way more customers than normal. Not only did Courtney apologize for the delay in service and food, she happily took our orders without writing them down and delivered hot, delicious, and correct food when it was ready.  While it wasn't the quickest turnaround, there is some common sense to be taken into account here and not reflective of a bad restaurant, just bad circumstances. Every other customer there seemed to understand the situation and would simply cash out their checks if the service was not in their time table.",

There's only two of us on the table mind you.  It wasn't like there's 6 of us who has complicated order. The waitress was lousy!!! She looked like she felt obligated to work there. No life nor even a smile on her face when serving customers. Asked her 3x for coffee and my boyfriend finally stood up for the 4th time to get the word enter her head. Asked her why the food took forever and all she can say was \"don't know\", not even an apology for forgetting the coffee or food being served late. She's like a dead fish!!  She's not writing down orders from customers which screwed up my order!!  Her service is a bad representation of the restaurant. I think the manager or owner need to take customer service 101 class to know how to serve customer or survive in the service business to better train their employees. I won't go back there ever again!!!!!! And will spread the word to my Channelside neighbors. These residents deserve better.",
