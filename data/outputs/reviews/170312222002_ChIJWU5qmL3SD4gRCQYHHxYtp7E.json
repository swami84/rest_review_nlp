This gave me food poisoning, and the next day the manager of the restaurant came to pick up the unfinished dish because he didn't believe when I called that I was telling the truth.  Seeing the uncooked shrimp for himself, he apologized, told me that their chef refused to accept that he hadn't cooked the food properly and left.  I hadn't ordered from them for a long time because of this disagreeable experience, but today I decided to order.  I figured I'd be safe if I didn't order seafood.  About half an hour after placing my order, I received an email saying that it had been cancelled.  When I called the restaurant to ask why, I was told that the chef would no longer serve me because of what happened the last time I ordered.  I think this tells you everything you need to know about the service here.  They won't take responsibility when they make a mistake, and when you give them a second chance they offend you for a second time.  This restaurant doesn't deserve to be in business.",

About a thirteen minute walk, but I won't be coming here again.  I ordered all specials. The tiger cry steak, the pork shank, and the soft shell crab entree. The pork was dry. The steak sat on a bed of green beans and they were bland as hell. The soft shell crab was the best. And it had spice, but it's crazy I have to go to a place three times to be satisfied.

The ramen outside of the noodles themselves was fantastic, best broth and vegetables I've had in a long time. The Massaman sweet potato curry on the other hand tasted like pure vomit. It was way too sweet and left a bad taste in your mouth which was too similar to puke (curry had puke texture as well). I didn't want to waste my money, but was forced to throw the entire curry in the garbage because I couldn't take it anymore.",

When I visited I had been drinking all weekend and was craving a crispy smoothy something with cucumbers or apples. Turns out they had a smoothie menu!

From here my girlfriend and I differ in our opinions. While we both thoroughly enjoyed the decor, she was not a big fan of the music when we first sat down, calling it elevator music. However, I loved it and practically danced through the meal. My plate, the Asparagus and Shrimp stir fry, was amazing. Vegetables were crisp and fresh, the shrimp had real flavor. They even suggested a beer which tasted very good with the food. However, my girlfriend had the Pad Thai. While it was very flavorful, it wasn't what she was expecting. The noodles seemed different, and the sauce wasn't plentiful enough. Despite that, we enjoyed an app, entrees, a couple drinks, and fried ice cream. I say two thumbs way, way up. She says one thumb up, but still quite good.",
