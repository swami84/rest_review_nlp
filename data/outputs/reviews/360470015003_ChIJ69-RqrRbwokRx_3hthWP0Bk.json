Bun was a Martin\u2019s potato hamburger bun, which was totally inadequate for this sandwich. Ate half with a fork. Pork was tasty, but would have been much better with the sauce mixed in. Disappointed overall.",

Theres an employee there (I don't know her name but for identification purposes, an Asian girl) who gave a small squirt of BBQ on top... But it was so dry I asked her to grab a side a barbecue sauce.... she said she would get it for me but I never got it as she ended up ignoring me. I really didn't like this girl's attitude.. not friendly at all! I will not go back.",

Smoke flavor and buffalo sauce with a great crisp from the frier. The waffle fries were done to order. Ribs looked great, I didn't have them but I will next time. With the lunch deal it was a great price. Highly recommend.",
