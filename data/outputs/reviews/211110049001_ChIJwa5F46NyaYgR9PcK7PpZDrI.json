The quiche was over cooked, that hashbrowns were actually cube cut potatoes and cheese. Way different from what I expected although it was the most flavorful plate. The chicken and waffle was very dry.  The best part of the meal was the yogurt parfait, the desserts and spending time with my friends. Definitely won't return.",

They used a thick smoked bacon that had been almost candied. Nice touch. Portions are more than enough. Bread was original as an amazing soft yeast loaf that was almost moist. Different from anywhere else. Excellent menu. French fries were perfectly seasoned and amazing! Sadly, they were the best tasting thing we ordered. The bad: we had reservations and still had to wait 30 minutes. It took another 20 minutes to get water. The waiter was very professional and apologized several times. The food runners consistently brought food out and had no clue where it went to. I don\u2019t know if the rotating room threw them off or the fact that the tables were numbered in red against wood grain and barely visible. The several hours we were there, not one food runner went directly to the correct table without assistance or returning to kitchen with the food.  The lobster bisque was good but very average. Now for the most important part.....the steak was one of the worst I have ever eaten. I ordered the filet. It was overcooked, tough, and literally tasteless. After waiting an hour and a half for it, I was more than disappointed. Sadly, it was straight out of a sizzler buffet. My husband opted for a burger and it was much better than the filet. I hope this restaurant can get someone to fix these issues because with has a lot of potential. If you are wanting an excellent steak, this is not the place to go.",

Our waitor Carl was overly attentive, over talked us and almost insisted we go with his recommendations for food and drink. We had to literally asked for a minute to review the menu then insist on the items we wanted. The food was disappointing the steak was well done we asked for medium. It was very chewy maybe thus steak was aged or grass fed but it was the cowboy ribeye. We also got mashed potatoes mac and cheese and asparagus. The sides we or the dessert was horrible the cake was different crumble not warm and thebice cream was the cheap vanilla bean from publix. Very disappointing for new Yeats meal but glad to have my husband here with me to bring in the new year. Positive is we are also staying at the hotel so no driving or Uber because the cocktails were great.",

First our cocktails were inconsistent, 2 of us ordered the same drink and one had very little alcohol in it if any and the other had so much that it was barely drinkable and my husband's Mojito had no taste of alcohol. Our waiter worked hard but the server was pathetic. We literally waited 2 hours before I got my premeal salad. My husband even walked up to the kitchen and asked about our food. Before that the server told our waiter 3 times he had given us bread but didn't and instead served all the tables around us that came in after us. Once we finally got bread it was good.  Our food finally arrived and overall tasted good except my brocolini was so overcrisp it fell apart and I couldn't eat it and my husband's mushrooms he ordered were way too burbony he couldn't eat them. So the restaurant is inconsistent overall and not worth the $327 bill that received no adjustment or apologies.",

Our server, John was attentive, knowledgeable, and beyond friendly. Perfect wine recommendations for our entrees. The food went above all expectations. I had the 10oz Filet mignon and my girlfriend had the Ahi Tuna. We also had the mac n cheese, truffle fries, and mushroom sides. I cannot stress enough how perfect everything was. The spinning dining room gave constant change of scenery of the river and Louisville city at night. We also received a complimentary night stay at the Galt House hotel which was a splendid bonus.

The service on the other hand was the worst I have ever experienced at a \u201c5 Star\u201d restaurant. We got there right at our reservation time, 6pm and we were seated immediately. Our waiter brought us water and took our drink orders. 2 cocktails, 1 beer and a coke.  It took about 20-25 min to get our cocktails/beer.  The coke took another 20 min. When we were finally able to order, which was about an hour after we arrived we ordered an appetizer and our entrees at the same time since we weren\u2019t sure when we would see our  waiter again. Our appetizer (4 meatballs) came about 25 minutes later, followed by the salads a few minutes after that. Our entrees finally arrived just after 8pm. We were missing a side with one of the meals, but our waiter didn\u2019t know that because we didn\u2019t see him again until after I had to get a manager so we could get our check. It was around 8:45 at this point in time.  We had ran out of water that we got when we arrived, the coke we waited 40 minutes for.. that was the only one we got. Our table was full of appetizer and salad dishes that never got picked up and the desert my brother in law was supposed to get for it being his birthday.. well that had to be packed to go because we told the sitter we would be back by 9. All in all just a terrible experience for a $300 dinner.",

The Pau Hana grog was all water, and no alcohol. No big deal, send it back and apologize. Our appetizers came quickly enough. One lump crab cake for 18 dollars. Ughh. Okay, but it was almost the best thing we ate all night. Also got the meatball skewers. Delicious. Poor start but so far so good. Excited for dinner.  Dinner came maybe 35 minutes later. No big deal, I got okay wine and good company. Food arrives. Duck fat potatoes were good, but no duck fat in sight. Truffle cream spinach was fine but it wasn\u2019t fine dining delicious. The broccolini with sundried tomatoes was on par, but that was it for the sides. Next up, a 47$ ribeye (8oz) and a 38$ signature entree, fillet a la swizzle. Ribeye was amazing, worth the price and the wait. The chimichurri was amazing. However, the fillet was just fine. It was good, interesting cracker (confit tart, crisp and layered like a buttermilk biscuit) but not worth the price or the wait. Lobster bisque never came. All in all not a great experience. This was a full house, but what appeared to be a normal weekend dinner. No one waiting until later, when we were leaving (745).  Final straw. The chocolate cake. It was passable, but it wasn\u2019t fine dining. 12 dollars for a slice and you expect \u201csomething.\u201d Right? Cake was dry, icing okay, covered in chocolate syrup. Syrup. Like Nesquik. Really? Okay.  Probably won\u2019t be back.",

The portion size was incredible for the price! Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and we were impressed by the variety of menu offerings too. I recommend this place 100% and make sure your dining experience will include the sun setting because it was beautiful to see up on the 25th floor!

Everything from the appetizer to the desert was delicious. And let\u2019s not forget about the cocktails. Friends if you\u2019re looking for a great place to wet the whistle you simply won\u2019t find a greater selection or quality in the drinks. They have two separate drink menus. And the hand crafted cocktails are one of a kind. Please don\u2019t pass this place up.",

I mean like boozy balloon spoons that you wouldn\u2019t believe!  And the steak? They must keep cows back in that kitchen, it\u2019s so fresh and delicious.  The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable! The GM, Westley Harris, checked on our table to ensure we were having nothing but a stellar evening, while wearing a blue velvet suit. If we were not having a good time already, the suit would have pushed us over the edge of these beautiful views that I haven\u2019t even mentioned.  11/10 would recommend and go back soon!",

My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at Swizzle. We started things off with 2 appetizers, the jumbo shrimp cocktail and the crabcake- both were excellent.  Next, we split the wedge salad, and it too was delicious.  For our main entree, we split the 16oz ribeye (oscar style, cooked medium) and it was cooked to perfection and the oscar style really kicked it up a notch!  We also shared the 1 pound baked potato with butter, sour cream and chives and it was very good as well.  I can't complete this review without mentioning our waitress, Lynsey.  She was friendly, attentive and informative/helpful regarding the menu.  We can't say enough about her- she enhanced our experience at the restaurant and made for an enjoyable stay at the hotel.  She needs to be recognized by management as an excellent team member!!!!",

We had a excellent date night there and the value was unbeatable.  The service was excellent. Our server, CASH, went out of his way to make sure we was well taken care of and did a great job. He constantly checked in with us and was very informative on the menu and the drinks.  He was very funny and down to earth as well. The chefs politely check in on us as well and really cared that we enjoyed the food they prepared. Thank You Cash and all the Swizzle staff for your hospitality! You really made us feel welcomed.  The food and drinks where amazing. We splurged a little as a thank you for the room. We had the Fillet and Salmon which was excellent and cooked perfectly. For Sides we had the asparagus, mashed potatoes, calamari and house salad. I cant complain about any of it. I'd love to learn how to make the Calamri Sauce cause it was fire! The cocktails were excellent as well. We had desert too, the choclate cake, and it was wonderful  If I had to choose something to complain about it would be the fact we didnt get seated on the rotating floors. I know due to Covid and the spacing-out not everyone was going to get seated there. We will be back and next time we will request it.  Thanks again for the wonderful evening and look forward to being a repeat customer.",

It takes roughly 50 minutes to go around the entire rotating space. When you make a reservation, be sure to ask for a table in the rotating section, as they have quite a few tables that don't move. They also have a bar in the middle, just after you pass the open kitchen. I loved the cocktail selections, although fell short on their molecular shot. The potato gnocchi was excellent as was the ribeye steak. It was cooked perfectly. Highly recommended for a different kind of restaurant with great food & drinks to go with it. Perfect for a special occasion.",
