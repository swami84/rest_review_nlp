This place is great for real authentic Cantonese cuisine, of course come with someone who knows how to order, other wise you won\u2019t get the full experience. You can usually ask the waiters for suggestions on a tradition meal combo, they usually serve 5 or 10 people and it\u2019ll have the authentic dishes included. I would recommend always to start with a soup, not the hot and sour or egg drop, but some soup with vegetables and bones. Or some seafood.",

It was cut way too thick..Tough as old boots..Under seasoned....Bland almost..  Second was stir fried glass noodles with seafood...Well...Scratch that..Hardly any seafood to be found..Even the one shrimp look so lonely..  Third, stir fried goose intestines with bell peppers...The goose intestines were crunchy...It's obviously been added baking soda to clean the products... Can still taste it too..  Lastly, sweet n sour pork cutlets....Just change name to just sweet pork..The sugar n vinegar balance is way off...Way too sweet...Way too much sauce...  It's not easy to find an exceptional Cantonese cuisine restaurant in Chicago anymore..Better make some changes Please improve....",

        "caption": "I've eaten at Mayflower for the past year at least a few times a month. My experience has primarily been dinner off the traditional Chinese menu. I'm a cook myself and am fairly critical of food. Like every Chicago Chinatown restaurant, it cooks certain dishes well and others lacking. For example, the white cut chicken (half or whole) is the best, relatively speaking, among all the Chinatown restaurants. It is very fresh, soft, and cooked in-house. I've also consistently enjoyed the following dishes: fresh steamed shrimp (shell on, live), light soy, stir fried rice noodles, shredded leg of lamb with green onions & ginger, chicken + egg plant + salty fish casserole, lamb stew casserole (gravy option), deep fried garlic pork chops, deep fried salt & pepper squid or calamari, deep fried or salt + pepper quail or squab, pork spare ribs w/ bitter melon, fried whole flounder w/ yellow chives, walnut shrimp, fried fish cake w/ chestnuts, scrambled eggs with oysters or shrimp, pork belly w/ preserved vegetables casserole, fresh steamed oysters with black bean + soy sauce, steamed whole snapper, water crest (broth option) with golden eggs, peapod leaves stir fried w/ minced garlic, and stir fried tong choy (water spinach) with minced garlic, bean curd paste + peppers, or shrimp paste.  However, the following dishes at Mayflower have consistently been disappointing: salt & pepper shrimp (shell on), black pepper short ribs, green onion & ginger lobster (sometimes), seafood medley stir fry,  The night shift waiters are pretty cool, hard working, young, and accommodating. They've, without hesitation, voided orders that I didn't like; that's made me trust them, which is really important to the dining experience.  I feel most comfortable at this restaurant in Chinatown primarily for a decent, quick Chinese dinner. Front of the house was recently renovated and comfortable. Like any Chinese restaurant, the customers can be  unaware of their sound levels and obnoxiousness.",
