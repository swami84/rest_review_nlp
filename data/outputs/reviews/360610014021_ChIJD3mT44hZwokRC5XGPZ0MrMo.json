        "caption": "Apparently this place had had other locations in nyc for a while now. I just discovered them walking through the market. After buying a slice of pizza from slice joint I was still hungry so as soon as I saw them I had to try it. And good thing I did because it was super delicious. So good that I had to tell the staff how great the al pastore taco was. I just wish that the taco wasn't $6. But it's definitely worth it to come back when my pockets are loaded. If flavor is any measure of success then this chain is going to be well-known throughout the country or definitely in the tri-state.",
