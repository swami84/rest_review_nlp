I love the Denver omelet in the morning, and my go-to for lunch is soup and grilled cheese. The soup specials change daily, and you can add extras like ham and tomato to your grilled cheese. My personal favorite is the potato soup! it's filling, delicious, and has that home-made touch. The grilled cheese and soup combo is less that $7--can't beat it! To top it off, all of the employees are incredibly kind. It is truly a hidden gem. Tip: it doesn't have a storefront on Michigan Avenue, you must go into the Michigan Plaza office buildings.",

The Turkey Club is outstanding, Italian beef great, but for the rest of the employees in the 233 N Michigan building need to learn Customer service and take pride in there cooking. Fries should never be re-fried and given to customer and think that we should accept whatever you give us, when we are the paying customer. Hope that this gets better, because the Breakfast is outstanding, but it's all about how you present yourself to your customers. I've noticed even when you order online and go pick it up, it's not the same as being there and watching them prepare your food.  5/31/19 ONCE AGAIN SERVE HORRIBLE FRIES WITH MY MEAL AND I HAVE MENTIONED TO THEM SEVERAL TIME TO NOT GIVE ME THOSE FRIES SITTING THERE. MY REQUEST HAS ALWAYS BEEN, GIVE ME FRESH FRIES, SO I FIGURED BY NOW, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE IT TOGETHER BY NOW. THIS IS NOT TO CHANGE ANYONE FROM GOING TO RESTAURANT , BUT FOR THE WORKERS TO TAKE PRIDE IN PREPARING FOOD.",
