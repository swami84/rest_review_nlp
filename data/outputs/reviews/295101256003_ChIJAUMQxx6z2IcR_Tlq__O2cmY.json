I can't recall when was the last time i was presented with Indian food that was anything but. I was appalled at the buffet choice and some one said it was mediocre and that's an understatement. It is far from mediocre to the point that it is a one and done experience for anyone looking for an authentic Indian food. Not one of the buffet items were presentable and looked like they were cooked in a hurry or burnt. I am sorry I am not sure how people can give 4 stars. I have dined in far better Indian restaurants which have 2-3 stars minimum. This is just an honest review from someone who knows Indian food quite a bit and even folks who are not Indian but have experienced good Indian food may find this place quite disappointing.",

The food was good, not great, which exactly what I expect from a buffet at lunch. The staff was incredibly friendly and the place is clean. The buffet never ran out and the selection was just big enough to be satisfied.  The highlights: coconut curry chicken and a wide array of chutneys that were all tasty. Bang for the buck depends on your hunger - I'm a hungry guy so ROI was high.  The lowlights: the friend goods had obviously been steam tabled, because they were all soggy by the time they hit my plate, not crispy.  Would I go back? Probably, but it's not 5he first place I'd think of if downtown.",

There is a decided lack of information on the website regarding the nature and cost of the lunch buffet,  and the phone went straight to voicemail at 11:30am. I later discovered that the price ($9.95, weekday) was actually given in a rotating banner picture.  The website mentioned setting new standards for the quality of Indian food,  but the small selection compared to the Indian buffets I am used to in Kansas City did not even tempt me to try.  There was no salad at all, and three vegetarian choices.  At 12:30pm, there was a single table occupied.  And the price to value relationship was nothing to brag about. I think if the website would create more realistic expectations,  I would have probably stayed.",

I guess it takes being away from the city to realize this is simply the BEST Indian restaurant I've ever been too.  Let's start with the food, the buffet selection is amazing - it offers an array of delicious chicken, lamb/goat, and vegetarian options. Some menus are rotating. All dishes are well prepared all FULL OF FLAVORS. Not to mention so many choices of chutneys/dips. I could never get tired of the dishes here. Btw, their ground lamb is usually pretty spicy but most other dishes do not have a lot of heat. They, however, have a rather mild but creamy taste that flatters the flavor of the ingredients themselves. I actually prefer that the dishes are not just masked by heavy spices.  Amazing Indian cuisine at a shockingly affordable price is not the only reason I came here. My favorite part has always been the owner of Mr. Curry's. He is the one of the nicest, kindest, and most genuine person I've ever met. He always warmed my heart whenever I came here. He would kindly offer tips and solutions for the most trivial questions I brought up. I hope he is doing well! I want to have the chance to say thank you to him again.  Their Chai is the most delicious but not aggressive I've ever had. They bottled the mix for sale for a while that literally made my day. I hope they bring it back. Btw they now offer takeouts priced by weight, so you can get fresh, hot, yummy food in small portions without worrying about wasting it. How great is that!  I'm a huge Asian food lover and this has been my favorite place to treat myself on a budget. Even the memory of it has made me disappointed by most other Indian restaurants I came across, be it in San Francisco or DC. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a mild Indian cuisine or just need someone to talk to.",

As I drove all the way from Belleville with the expectation of enjoying a lunch buffet at the special price of $8.75 which was not the case. As they have now increased their price to $9.95, but have yet to update their website. So although I walked in with an open mind I was already feeling a little let down. In all fairness to my experience with the food though. I did thoroughly enjoy the Aloo Sag and the Nan, but was highly dissappointed in all the other dishes being served. Which at the time of my visit were Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Korma, Basmati Rice, Vegetable Biriyani, Channa Tikka Masala and Dal Sag. What I found myself most dissappointed with was the lack of authenticity in the flavor of the different dishes. Growing up one of my mothers best friends was of Indian decent and I was graciously afforded the opportunity of eating delicious authentic home cooked Indian cuisine quite often. So my level of expectation may be higher than others. I also found it quite ridiculous how small the cups were they made available for your beverage. As it was extremely inconvenient to continuously have to get up to refill your cup meanwhile your foods getting cold. The end all for me though was finding out about the $1.00 fee they wanted to charge me for paying with my card rather than paying with cash. Overall not the greatest experience, but if I happened to be in the area I'd stop in just to get some Aloo Sag & Nan to go.",
