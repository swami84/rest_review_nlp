They also have a brunch day party situation earlier in the day. The DJ was playing great music but it wasn\u2019t too loud that I couldn\u2019t converse with Bae. The ambiance was nice and elegant with dim lights. Their unisex bathroom is very clean. The food menu wasn\u2019t overwhelming it was simple but full of great options. We drank a old fashion with our choice of Whiskey and had a bottle of Merlot and we were able to take the rest home. Service was superb and I\u2019m looking forward to coming back, but hopefully for brunch",

Not only does The Park supply the BEST macaroni and cheese, chicken, chicken and waffles (brunch), greens, etc... but they do it with a very sophisticated twist. You truly get the 5 star experience here. Decor is nothing short of elegant.  Staffing is extremely warm and welcoming. Service is quick and dependable. They have DJs throughout that provide a wide variety of throwbacks to current hits. To me, this has a high end restaurant and lounge vibe. Very much dress to impress! Great drinks and plenty of room to dance and plenty of TVs for my boyfriends enjoyment. Tables are placed so that you can have your own private date or easily mingle and make friends with the surrounding parties. Absolutely recommend",

It's a bit cheaper if you purchase the ticket online in advance. The mimosas were WEAK and the buffet lines were long. This place is 4 levels and they only have one buffet set up. But the food was VERY good, which is why I'm still giving them 4 stars. The vibe was good as well. They're very strict on the 2 hour limit but many places are. Overall I wouldn't recommend it unless you really want the vibe.",

My sister\u2019s a huge fan of Park so whenever she comes home, Park is her club of choice. So of course she wanted to celebrate her 29th bday there (Nov. 2). We arrived to Park around 10:30 & got next in line around 10:45. The group in front of us had a guy that was too drunk to get in & after a back & forth of trying to get him out of line once his friends left him, you could tell Charles\u2019s mood was completely thrown off until someone else came out & tried to walk him onto the sidewalk. Now it\u2019s about 10:50 & even though we were next in line, we jus knew they\u2019d hold the line til 11 like most clubs do & cause us to pay for entry which we really didn\u2019t wanna do since we preferred to spend that money on bday shots. So we told em it was her bday & showed him her id to prove it. He said \u201cgive me a second\u201d, moved us to the side, smiled, wished her a happy bday & let us go in once they calmed the guy in front of us down. We were so happy he let us in, I jus had to ask him his name & told him I promised to write a review for him. I know I\u2019m almost 3 weeks late Charles but I had to keep my word ! Park, pleaseee keep this man on your payroll because I love seeing him at the entrance whenever I go !",

Went for a homecoming alumni celebration (as an alumna)  and presented MY VALID drivers license and was asked by security to present another form of identification such as my passport or credit card. I asked the security guard why would I need to present a passport if I just presented my ID. I was refused entry because I did not have a credit card on me *i was carrying cash and did not agree with being asked to present another form of ID to get into a club. I\u2019ve NEVER had issues getting into a club. This security guard was completely unprofessional. He did not ask me to verify any information on my license just said it did not look like me. Well I took that picture when I was 18 FIVE YEARS AGO! In Florida you do not have to replace your picture when you get a new ID. I\u2019m disgusted by the lack of professionalism in this place. It was illegal and Racist what this security guard did. I will not be going back.",

I tried to scream his name to get his attention on three separate occasions. Finally, by the fourth I was successful. He comes over and says \u201coh sorry you wanted me?\u201d We\u2019d been sitting with empty glasses for the past 20 minutes. Also, he took away my silverware and didn\u2019t replace it at all. When I flagged him down AGAIN and asked for a set to replace it, he said \u201cokay\u201d....and promptly forgot. It really felt like we\u2019d paid $90 to be ignored for 2 hours. Disappointing.",

Much to my surprise, The Park also has a menu (who knew that as a college kid? Lol) and the food is divine. More specifically, the ribeye steak is FANTASTIC. Cooked to perfection.  On the flip side: It bothered my friends that our waitress came by  and brought us water before our entire party arrived, but then never came back once everyone arrived. We had to tap random servers that passed by to order everything after the waters. And this is just a \u201cme\u201d thing: the music was SO LOUD. Too loud to have a conversation at a dinner table or a happy hour (but than again, The Park is a club, so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)",

The food was very good, but the brunch is $40, plus $8 service charge per person.  In essence, you\u2019re looking at $48 per person.  Somewhat unreasonable in a city with so many good choices.

This was the first time I had come to their day party and after my experience, I will not be back. Upon arrival, there was a crowd of people just standing around the entrance. My party stood in this makeshift line for 10 minutes before the bouncers decided to tell everyone there were specific lines you needed to stand in to get inside. Even though we made a reservation, we had to stand in a 25+ person line in the cold and rain to get inside.  Once we made it to the front of the line after 30+ minutes, my bag was checked and I was denied entry due to a small mace I have on my key chain. I didn't think anything of it because it is for my protection and I had been to dinner at the Park before and there wasn't any bag check. The bouncer informed me that the only way I could enter was if I threw away my mace even after I offered to return it to my car and come back (if I did this, I would be forfeiting my entry to the 'establishment' and could not return that day). He claimed he also couldn't hold it until I left either because there was alcohol on the premises. Unless he planned on drinking while he was working, I don't understand how that was an issue. The whole situation was ridiculous.  Brunch was a buffet style, which would have been fine if they had a big enough space to accommodate all the people that were there, but they don't. Everyone was literally on top of each other trying to get food and and take their plates back to their seats. If you don't have a reservation, you have to stand around with your plate or just hangout at the bar, either of which makes the place even more crowded. We couldn't even fully enjoy our time there because our waitress was trying to rush us out before 5:30 to prepare for a bottle service table.  The only reason why this review has two stars is because the food and music were good. Sunday Brunch service is trash.",

This place is very costly with poor customer service. The food was not only disgusting but under cooked. I sent two of my meals back and it took so long for them to replace my order I decided to cancel my order to prevent self frustration. With it being New Years Eve, I graciously told my waiter I will continue my night without food. As the night continued i purchased a bottle of champagne to bring in the new year, as well as, preparation to propose to my girlfriend. As soon as I make the purchase I was stopped by security and was accused of attempting to use the bathroom in the middle of the club. Of course I thought he was joking because what idiot would want to do the in a club full of people. I informed the gentleman he must be mistaken and have me confused with someone else. He began to get loud with me and aggressively pushed me towards the stairs to leave. I find it to be ironic due to the fact that i just spent over $300 and now being forced to leave right before midnight. I asked to speak to the manager on duty and to review the security footage. I find it very shameful and shocking for a place who market their business on professionalism and sophistication, but their staff consist of ignorant people who don't have any form of common sense. At this point I have contacted management and starting the process to recoup my loss, as well as, address the situation that occurred. I dont not recommend this place to anybody. I have informed all of my professional colleagues and posted the unfortunate situation on my social media accounts. I hope by me sharing my experience will help others and prevent issues as such from occurring.",

It was 1:40am, freezing! and our belongings including our coats were at our table.  I asked the gentleman outside why we are waiting?... there was no line, we had our wrist bands on and we purchased a table.  He was very rude and said: \"because you have to wait!\" He was letting other people go in as they walked up.  I was freezing, and again asked him why he was keeping us outside?  He then said we were \"aggressive\" and could not come back in.  The other men outside seemed to take direction from him.  We were kept outside freezing for 25 minutes until luckily a friend came looking for us. I have never in my life been treated so badly after spending so much money and for no apparent reason.

I found a flier for an event hosted there online and it stated that entry was free until 11:30, great. I got there at 10:30, I figured the wait would be long given that DC serves a large population. After waiting over an hour in line, watching people in the line charge other people to get in front of them, and noticing there was a lack of security by the gates as people slide through the gates to skip to the front of the line, I get to the front after 11:30 and I am told I must pay $60 to enter. I then ask the staff what do they plan to do to address these issues and was informed I could talk to the man in charge, after he rudely cut me off and did not take any of my concerns seriously. I spoke to his boss, I assume, and he tells me he could only let 300 people in free, mind you there were less than 300 people in the line, that he can't do everything, which makes no sense if he owns the place,  and that people will be people.The disrespect of the staff here was absolutely outrageous and I will never be back here again. I recommend that people look to another place to enjoy their DC experience.",

When my bestie invited me to dinner, of course I said yes!  After she told me it was at Park, I had to do a double take.  I didn't know this but Park is a restaurant and a club all in one!  It was definitely intimidating standing outside wearing jeans and a t-shirt while everyone else was dressed up like they were about to go clubbing at 6pm on a Thursday afternoon.  After the bouncer let me in and my bestie showed up, whom was dressed up (thanks for the memo), we sat down at a small table right behind the hostess desk.  The table looked liked like it could only hold a few drinks but surprisingly it held all the food that we had ordered.  We ordered the fried calamari, the sampler platter, and of course the key lime parfait, vanilla bean ice cream, and the chocolate melt away cakes.  The fried calamari came out piping hot yet it was delectably crispy.  The sample platter came out and it was a huge square place with 5 compartments for each of the items to sample.  The sample platter was made up of grilled shrimp, filet mignon, jerk chicken wings, blackend salmon with sweet corn bread, and baked macaroni & cheese.  My favorite from the sampler platter hands down was the Filet Mignon.  It was cooked the perfect medium rare on top of creamy mashed potatoes served with a red wine demi glaze.  My second favorite was the grilled shrimp, it was topped with a salty, tangy, sweet dressing that just complimented the smokey shrimp perfectly.  I heeded the advice of my waitress and got the vanilla ice cream with the chocolate melt away cakes and my goodness, it was the best decision I made that day.  The cakes were a bit bitter and warm so eating it with a scoop of ice cream gave was absolutely perfect.  You had the sweetness of the ice cream balancing out the bitterness of the chocolate cake and the ice cream is cold with a super warm/hot chocolate cake just made the experience magically delicious. The garnish of raspberries gave my taste buds a nice refresher after each cake.  Alone the cakes and ice cream weren't that great, but together, it's awesome!  If you like warm brownies with a scoop of ice cream, you'll like this! HIGHLY RECOMMEND TOGETHER.  BE WARNED: it is a club after all so the music is really loud and you will have to shout to talk to the person across from you.  There are a lot of people walking around with drinks in their hands either waiting around for a table or dancing.  GRATUITY is always included, even if you have a party of 2 or 6, it's already apart of the bill!  Service can be slow, but i think it's because the music is so loud, it takes a bit for the wait staff to hear people's order and such. Also the day that I went, there were only 2-3 waiters for all 8ish tables (only saw the tables in the front near the front door on the 1st level)  Overall the food was surprisingly good and our waitress was awesome!  Having dinner at park was definitely a very unique and enjoyable dining experience.  I would come back for dinner but request a table that isn't stationed right in the middle of the walkway.",

BUT LADIES PLEASE READ:  Last night me and my friends casually and soberly strolled through the club when on the second floor level a drunk guy pushed me AFTER I said excuse me. Words were exchanged and a bouncer/security guard approached the situation and i explained. The friend of the guy who pushed me was putting his hands in my face spilling his drink on me, which led me to knock his hand away causing his drink to fall. Their party was escorted out after security reviewed cameras ( even tho 2 witnesses confirmed but whatever)  Long story short; we get outside and the situation seems iffy. Like the appointed cop on duty seems to be a regular working at the club. He was so petty , literally the whole situation focus became ME moving his hand out of my face, WHICH I HAVE A RIGHT TO DO, instead of the guy simply being arrested since they wanted to go as far as checking cameras but didn\u2019t proceed on with anything. The bouncers ans security seem shiesty and it appeared like they all were working together on some \u201c let\u2019s sweep this under the rug\u201d VS \u201c let\u2019s get him out of here and make sure these young, 21 year Old college girls are ok...\u201d I was pressured into dropping everything just so I can go home . It\u2019s sad and I felt so small . I wanted to go off but I had to remember I\u2019m just trying to get out of this situation  I would say  ladies beware and be careful . Guys are weird and men are shiesty.  Men; do better . Don\u2019t come To the  club to harass women because you never know who you\u2019re dealing with or what man will come up and harass you for feeling bold enough to touch a woman.  Period .

We ordered a few drinks, a number of appetizers, and an entree. At around the two hour mark we ordered more drinks. A very tall light skinned black man with a beard (perhaps the manager) told us we needed to get the checks because the two hour table reservation was up. Before I could respond and tell him we just ordered another round of drinks he proceeded to cut me off by repeating what he said and then walked away. He found the waitress for our table and seemed to scold her. A few minutes later the waitress informed us there was a misunderstanding. She apologized and said he didn\u2019t know we ordered another round, therefore we can stay longer. He would have known that if he took the time to listen and not speak to me in an inpatient condescending manner.  I\u2019m debating going back and bringing friends if this is how staff behave.",

I never pay to step in there with my girlfriends because the promo staff regularly invites us as ladies. The Park offers a service where they\u2019ll give you a $70 bottle service if you check on before midnight. My girl group of 8 did that. As we were paying a security guy let us know it was after 12 midnight and we couldn\u2019t get the table for the discounted price. We were confused because we arrived and paid before 12 midnight but were still willing to pay door price. Mind you, I NEVER pay.   So as we were confused because we made it to pay for the table before midnight the owner, **Marc Barnes** Comes up to us and says \u201c I\u2019m a corny ass man and this is s corny ass club. You all with only 8 people, you with your areola out (talking to one of the ladies in my group who was dressed fine) , and y\u2019all just looking the way you do, you can all leave. You gotta go. Not getting into my club.\u201d Literally the RUDEST grown man I\u2019ve ever met. As a man who could be as old as my father and is a business owner none of that was necessary. Especially if he has a niece or daughter you should be ashamed Mr. Barnes. You cannot talk to women like that. I just want to let y\u2019all know he gave off prejudice/ racist vibes. All the ladies was with were black, gorgeous, and dressed in all red. Mr. Marc Barnes is incredibly incompetent and arrogant. Which why I\u2019m happy I didn\u2019t go in after being disrespected not only as a customer but as a women of color.",

This place has several levels to chill out after work on. From the upper levels, you can look down to the first floor and watch live performances. The staple happy hour \u201csnack\u201d are the jerk wings, which are packed with loads of flavors. You\u2019ll definitely want more. I get excited to come here just for the fall off the bone wings. These wings are paired with grandma style Mac and cheese, which has never disappointed me. Couple this with their famous punch and you\u2019ll feel a bit of a buzz.

Friday night dinner was amazing. Awesome food. Late night VIP was okay. We had to pour our own drinks. We were invited into every VIP on each floor.  All the guests were amazing respectful and fun. Easter breakfast was good, but they should have told us different food would be replaced and ongoing. Our friends are law students and received a free VIP and bottle bc they arrived late to dinner. Not a good business move, but... thanks P.R.. he was a total goon, posterity and friendliness was off. The park can do better.",

Although they are free, you end up spending on souvenirs and gifts in each store present at each attraction. Spend your time and fully enjoy the elegance of Washington DC!

I went back to the bar and called them out on this. But obviously, someone took the time to pour Fireball into a Tennessee Honey bottle. I guess they figured if people are drunk enough, they won't notice what they're drinking anyways.",

It may be because of the day party/group, but it was also really affordable; $20 for bottomless mimosas & $10 entrees is amazing &sometimes hard to come by in cities.

Since I don't frequent clubs as much as I did when I was bit younger, I decided to give this one a try since I was celebrating my birthday and I had heard so many great things about them just by me working in the Hospitality industry. I had dinner reservations which they kindly worked with me on when I had to modify the seating several times. I ordered the Jerk chicken and Macaroni and Cheese, which I had heard so much about, and the ppl stand corrected....it was bomb.....\ud83d\ude0a The server was excellent and the atmosphere was great. Since I had a dinner reservation late in the evening, I stayed for the club which was not a let down. There are 3 floors with DJ's  playing top hits, old and new. The crowd is mainly late 20's-40's and not once did I feel overwhelmed or out of place. It does get packed so if you're not into big crowds, then this place is not for you. Overall, I would go back again.",

This past weekend I received an email from I believe one their promoters/workers about an event on Monday afternoon. I followed the prompt and signed up for. Basically the email said you will receive two premium drinks and access to the buffet. I would like to add that I'm doing pretty well for myself thanks GOD. I arrived at the door right after 5pm and the bouncer told me straight up I don't anything about this it's $20 for the long line and $40 for the short one to get in. He didn't even give me chance to show him the info. As I stated above I'm a regular at the Park because I know personally a lot of their staff including Pierre. But this past Monday was way below the expectations because they had an attitude like you're there for freebies. I paid the $40, went in looking for someone in charge. They directed me to a light skinned gentleman, bald head, a little heavy set probably in his late 40s mid 50s. I wanted to understand if that email was a scam because it had all the info of the Park and it was on Event brite as well. He told me exactly this , there's nothing I can do for you have to pay to get in and here's a good card. I was speechless. Regardless of my expensive outfit and jewelry he just handed to me that stupid card for food like that's why I approached him. I will do my best to have a one on one with their upper management because that's unacceptable. They became a bit cocky and we can't let that happen because it will eventually ruin the reputation of the only good spot we have in the District.",
