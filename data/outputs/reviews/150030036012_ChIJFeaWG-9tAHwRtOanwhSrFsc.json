We've been here before several times before 2020 (we took my parents here, my in-laws here, our friends here) because their noodles are amazing and the flavor is fantastic. Plus, there aren't many restaurants on Hawaii that don't feel like \"Japanese fusion\".  Since the pandemic, we've had takeout from Mian a few times. The noodles travel surprisingly well and the dumplings also taste almost as good as if you were dining in. (In comparison, we've had noodles and dumplings from a closer area in Aiea where we live and they are nowhere as good even though we bring it back much more quickly than from Mian in town.)  I would definitely recommend this place for any of its items (but ask for \"mild mild mild mild\" if you cannot take heat at all)!",

The interior was cleanly, and it wasn't too busy around the time we went which was around noon. Food got to us relatively quickly. Parking is valet only, so you'll have to pay a small parking fee when you arrive, though not unreasonable depending on how long you stay (between $4.00 - $6.00).  The only reason I'm giving it a 3/5 is because the food was not to my liking, though not because of anything they did wrong but because of my own perception prior to coming there. As a ramen lover, I went here off a recommendation from a friend (who also thought this was a ramen shop based on the photos). I got the sichuan noodles with pork and a fried egg. I was disappointed with my dish because I wasn't aware the dish I ordered did not come with broth which heavily offset the taste for me. That, and I'm really not a fan of the fried egg in my noodles since my tastes are usually adjusted for the boiled egg you get in a ramen bowl. The Mung Bean soup they serve you when you first sit down was another thing I wasn't prepared for. I misheard the waitress and thought she said \"Miso Soup\" when she brought it over, so I was not prepared for the cold sweet liquid that hit my mouth a few seconds later.  All in all, the food isn't bad if you like Chinese Noodles and it was definitely a new experience for me to try. However,  if you normally eat ramen and walk in with a \"ramen-mindset\", then you are in for a rude awakening.",

First Chinese place I\u2019d def bring my chinese friends too. It\u2019s a chain and it does have two other locations on the mainland.  We decided to get spicy beef and egg with beef as the appetizers and got the picked beef noodle and intestine noodle. Everything has amazing flavor and the noodles are PERFECT! As my mom would say about the noodle, \u201cyo jer!\u201d It me, it\u2019s better then al dente, it has some spring/bounce to its noodle chew, but it doesn\u2019t means it\u2019s chewy like rubber or tough meat. It\u2019s amazing noodle texture. The broth is flavorful and the spicy heat is enough and not over powering. You can ask for water but you get mung bean soup as the drink which has a slight sweet taste. It\u2019s delicious!!! I can\u2019t wait to go back",

The spiciness was on point. Noodles is just a little bit undercook and a little hard to chew. Setbacks was the volume. Not much contained in the bowl and add-ons of any sides are expensive. They give you one free refill of plain noodle.  Service was pretty bad. The server had a really bad attitude. I couldn\u2019t get the noodle refill without wasting my breath to explain to him I can finish what I order. After all, I\u2019m paying for my food so why can\u2019t I order more? No one was serving us while we were raising our hands and the owner ended up helping us. We also had to get the water jug ourselves from the front and pour our own water. They have these relaxing green bean water to help soothe the spiciness in the noodle.  There is no parking available in the building so it is best to park across the street in the Walmart parking lot.",
