Bilal, the manager/owner was simply superb. From the moment we walked in, he seated us promptly, chatted with us and helped us in ordering exactly what we wanted. Due to the pandemic, there was a lot of take-out orders. Even though he was operating on a limited staff, Bimal was taking care of everyone and still never forgot to stop by our table. He sent us extra appetizers for us to taste and gave us complimentary desserts at the end.  The food was wonderful, the portions were big and the prices were reasonable too. Bimal & Sakoon was just superb. We will always go back. I could give this place more than 5 stars if I could!!",

        "caption": "Super spicy! This place used to be called Masala, but I guess it was sold and now the new chef is really into hot spices. I went there today (August 27, 2019) for their lunch buffet and it was quite an experience for me. Almost everything, except for noodles and rice, was very spicy. I was crying, blowing my nose every few minutes, and sweating bullets - all from that super spicy food. Seems like a good place to go during the cold&flu season; the food will clear your sinuses right away :) I was not the only one who was struggling with the amount of hot spices in the food today. In our party of 16, every single person who was sitting more or less close to me admitted that the food was too spicy. If you are into that sort of food then you will enjoy it there. If you are not into hot spices, probably wait till their chef slows down on all those peppers and spicy herbs.",

I ordered vegetable spring rolls for starters. They were piping hot and crisp. The cabbage, mushroom filling was very balanced and had great flavor. I liked them a lot.! Only suggestion would be to maybe dab the rolls on a tissue paper to absorb the excess oil and make it more \u201chealthy\u201d. :-)  The main course was Aloo Methi (Potato with Fenugreek based gravy) with Chili Naan. I had requested the rice that comes with the curry to be replaced by a naan and the hostess was very accommodating. The potatoes were prefectly cooked with just the right amount of bite to them and not turning mushy. The gravy was very wholesome and delicately spiced. The chilli naans were pretty good as well.  Overall, this is a restaurant with simple ambiance, great service and very well prepared food.",

Used to be a not-too-bad place for India lunch buffets, where you can get some veggie dishes and lots of different chicken dishes. But recently it has been going downhill drastically. It seems to me that they're, on purpose, very very slow to refill the meat dishes (by that I mean the chicken dishes). As a meat lover, it's frustrating eating there since my option is to either wait a long time for the meat, or just get the veggies there which is probably what they hope. Hopkins students can get 10% off if you show your ID. They never bothered to tell me that; I only found out from one of my friends. Last time I was there it was some holiday, and when I presented my Hopkins-ID asking for the discount, they said it was a holiday so there was no discount. I'm not eating there again - there are lots of great Indian places at Mt Vernon which is accessible by free shuttles. Also Namaste is a much better place also, which is less than 10min from JHU campus.",

I have usually gone for the afternoon buffet(4-5 times) so can't really speak for food ordered from the menu. Also the lunch buffet is $10 for Hopkins student so I should complain less I guess. I would rather see fewer but tasty items than a variety of mediocre ones.  What I liked: 1. Butter chicken sauce 2. Naan 3. Chili chicken 4. Chai(could be a bit stronger though, bit on the milkier side) 5. Desserts.  What I didn't like: 1. The chicken in butter chicken seemed very dry and didn't seem to have any flavor absorbed into it. Maybe they just throw frozen pieces of chicken into the sauce and heat it. 2. Tandoor chicken has the typical red color from the food coloring but tastes nothing like how it should. The last time I had it, I couldn't take more than 1 bite. It had a really bad flavor profile. 3. The onion pakoda was unpalatable because it smelled of burnt and heavily reused oil.  They used to be very good when they first opened, but food quality went down after a few months. I hope they do something about their food so that I have a good Indian restaurant near Hopkins(Homewood) to go to for lunch.",

I was initially going to order butter chicken and a side of naan bread. That totaled to about $20. Luckily for me, I was pressed for time and noticed the buffet to my left. That's when I asked the gentleman for the price of the lunch buffet. To my surprise, he told me it was $9.99 and I was able to pack an unweighed container to go. To bring an unnecessarily long story to a close, I filled my to go container with my favorite choices, received fresh naan bread for no additional charge and ran back to the office. Sometimes food from a buffet can be kind of bland and dried out. This food had a freshness to it as if it was made to order. I was in euphoria and will be returning to Masala Kitchen on a biweekly basis at the least.",

The place has changed a lot since I was last there. The venue is generally more appealing aesthetically. However, after sitting down we noticed a bleachy odor mixed with the smell you get from leaving clothing in the washer too long. I said whatever, let's get food. We get over to the bar to be greeted by a dilapidated offering of korma, saag paneer and jalfreezi. The only thing well stocked was the rice and sauces. The small plate dish (pakora) had little friend remains on a plate. The time we arrived to eat was at 1:15 pm. The buffet was offered until 3 pm. In the case of the pakora if you were out and not going to refill the station why would you keep the original tray with weird fried parts and garnish on out. Anyways, we got what was left and thought they would come out with refills. After 10-15 minutes the only refills made were the rice (which needed it the least), naan, the saag paneer and chicken tikka masala. The portion of saag paneer was only fit for two people as well. We were met with rubbery overcooked paneer on top of it all. I tried the chai tea (which was also at the very bottom of the barrel) which taste too diluted and not well balanced in spice. Overall, I was very disappointed in the lunch buffet this time around. I used to like this place a lot.",

We ordered delivery through OrderUp, and roughly 2 hours later called the restaurant to find out why the food had not arrived.  We were told that the delivery driver had been trying to contact us for 15 minutes and had not been able to do so.  I checked my phone and three text messages came through:  Hello delivery guy Outside Want food or not  No knock on the door. I understand that good help is hard to find, so rudeness from a delivery employee is not the end of the world.  I am giving Masala Kitchen a one star review because, when I called them to report the text messages, they told me that the driver was probably just angry that he couldn't get in touch with us.  No apology, no explanation that this behavior is not typical of their business-they attempted to justify the behavior.  I'm not a customer service stickler, but I will not patronize businesses that are openly and unabashedly rude to me.",

The saag paneer was yellow doused in butter, very little green and the paneer was hard and rubbery. Rice was extremely dry and raita was watery.
