I have to mention first the chicken fried steak because it was one of the best I've ever had; the batter was awesome. I got the gravy on the side and basically didn't touch it the chicken was so moist and delicious. The mac n cheese were very tasty too, and the BBQ shrimp were great. They are greasy (as BBQ shrimp in New Orleans should be) and you have to peel them, but very tasty.  The bathroom was spotless as well, which is a definite +++++  Great experience.

However the salad did come with the meal. I\u2019d have sooner spent 35 and gotten a fab meal. It just doesn\u2019t work for me.

Every time I\u2019ve gone it seems like the kitchen has a hard time handling a full restaurant and the food is poorly timed. Last night half of our table was almost done eating before we got our food and the table next to us got their food and one person was told that their food would take 10 more minutes. If you can deal with the inconsistent service it\u2019s worth checking this place out.",

The food is for the most part reasonably priced, sandwiches and a side around $14, dinner specials $27 including an average Caesar salad (no parmesan croute).

Mopping more often instead of just a wet floor sign is one of the reasons only 4 not 5 stars given.  The Mac and cheese side looked lacklustre.  Good choice for the shrimp and bean soup, salads are lovely and substantial, menu offers options for vegetarians and those that are gluten free.",

We got there and we were informed they were full they only had one table for four. Waiter said we were welcome to wait until they had available tables but we would have to wait outside. Ok no biggie I understand that they are not big of a restaurant. So we waited outside and saw about four people get out. We looked through the door glass and saw that they had left the table next to the other empty one. My nephew went inside and asked if we could be seated now? Waiter said \"no I'm sorry we don't have a table for six people\" my nephew said well what if we put this two tables together ( remember they were next to each other) waiter said no we are not allowed to do that, and with that we were dismissed. I don't want to make this about race but I think it was because we are Hispanic. At the moment I only saw Caucasians staff and customers. If it's not then good luck if you have a party of more than four people.",

The service however has gotten horrible in the past few months.: slow, inconsistent, and just don\u2019t give a damn.  I eat there at least once a week but tonight may be my last.   Just last Thursday I went in for a bowl of gumbo.  I tell everyone that EAT has the best gumbo.  Last Thursday my gumbo was so thick I could have solved NOLA\u2019s pothole problems with it.   Clearly this came from the bottom of the pot which had been sitting there for some time. Tonight I stopped by  and ordered an appetizer and gumbo.  They both came at the same time which too forever considering there were only two other tables when I got there.   The temperature was sub-zero so my gumbo was cold before I could get finished with my appetizer.  The couple at the table next to me ordered coffee to warm them.   I finished and them came the wait for my ticket.   I watched to get my waiter\u2019s attention but did not see him for a long while.  He finally brought my ticket and I had my credit card ready.   It took over 30 minutes to get my credit card receipt!  Another waiter finally brought my receipt and said something about having to reboot the system.  My waiter never came back.   This makes for three bad experiences in a row.  I will take a vacation from EAT.",

The atmosphere was amazing, and you could tell it was the owner's pride and joy.  The waiter was amazing, and guided us along with the food choices. I wanted Mac and Cheese, but he made sure to point out that their Mac and Cheese is done a differently and generally not what Mac and Cheese lovers want. So we ordered other things, and he still brought a tiny serving of the Mac and cheese out so we could know what the difference was! I  would recommend going with people you are comfortable sharing a plate with as there are far too many excellent choices on the menu! If you're into small local places, then this is it.",

I don't like pork or any kind of seafood but my woman does so I had Chicken Fried Chicken (couldn't wait to take picture) it was delicious and it comes with a side which I got Garlic Smashed Potatoes, it had rich taste. My fiance had Crawfish Pie. I just asked her and this is her response \"It was awesome, a lot of cheese, a lot of crawfish pieces\" it looked like a small little pizza. I car write the whole page with my ugly grammer about their Bread Pudding, It was the best pudding I've ever had.

The gumbo was a little over salted for my tastes but didn't even slow me down. The oysters were done perfectly, crunchy on the outside and oystery good in the middle, the baguette was more of a croissant in texture and flavor and perfect for dipping into the gumbo. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an excellent meal at reasonable prices. Will be coming back ASAP.",

This little restaurant on Dumaine Street in the French Quarter called 'Eat NOLA' hit the spot with some incredible Southern Cajun soul food.  A very quaint location with roughly twenty tables, the overall vibe of the restaurant was laid back and enjoyable.  For starters, we had the Crawfish Boullettes - little crawfish hushpuppies of love, fried lightly and filled with a blend of taste bud pleasing goodness.  The true bonus came while each bite was accompanied by an unreal Remoulade Sauce!  Next was the Chicken and Andouille Gumbo; better known as Gumbo Yaya (because there is no oakra).  This gumbo was utterly outstanding!  Healthy helpings of moist chicken and sausage that literally fell apart in my mouth, fantastic flavor with a slight creep of spicy love for good measure (this IS NOLA after all).  The side of rice was soft, moist and perfect for sopping up all the extra juices!  The WIN for me right off the bat was the Fried Catfish - crisp, moist, plump and bursting with natural flavors that were not overly fishy.  This specific dish was extremely light and airy; especially for a fried treat.  I must admit that I devoured the delectable delights of the sea and enjoyed their homemade tartar sauce.   The Pork Tenderloin was not only doused with caramelized onions; but was moist, not overly seasoned and very pleasant - the onions created a sweet and savory addition to each and every bite for a very well-rounded dish!  A great side to the pork was their homemade Mac & Cheese; an interesting take on an old classic - thin macaroni with flavoring that had my taste buds doing the Tango!  The Flatiron Steak was done to perfection while retaining its yummy juices - lightly seasoned and slightly soaked with an herb-ish butter; the heaping side of Garlic Smashed Potatoes was lightly salted, lumpy and offered a hint of garlic!  As for the BBQ Shrimp, be prepared for a little bit of a mess - these hefty shrimp are soaked in the 'bomb' sauce (WIN) which is a butter meets paprika blend with a touch of hot sauce; these peel your own shrimp are delectable and delightful!  Make sure to order the Fried Green Tomatoes as they were large, fresh and juicy tomatoes that were served warm, crispy and bursting with flavor in a doughy shell.  Now you know you are in Louisiana when it's time for dessert and out comes slices of cake that are almost as big as the pie-hole your about to shove them into!  All their desserts are homemade and I have to admit guiltily... utterly delicious!  The German Double Chocolate Cake was astounding!  Moist and decadent with sweet, rich flavor that left a smile on my face; especially with the addition of a coconut outer rim that blew me away!  Next up was the Three Nut Pecan Pie - ZOMG... sweet and chewy caramel love, drizzled over a pie erected by none other than almonds, walnuts and pecans - what a wonderful and completely enjoyable meal.  If you are looking to have a few drinks with your meal, make sure to hit up a liquor store prior to visiting - Eat has no liquor license; however they do happen to be BYOB (although uncorking fees are applicable).  We'd certainly recommend people to check out everything that Eat NOLA has to offer... certainly a great place to break bread with family or friends!",

Ate brunch; special was their version of hash which was very good; shrimp and grits was enjoyed, we are used to lowland grits in South Carolina, a bit pricey but not for the area: ordered The Trio of gumbo, gumbo and stuffed pepper, the pepper was excellent;  all portions of food were ample and they allow 'bring your own' beverage.  Served by Deb K. who was busy but attentive and Adam gave us the word on recent local venues and wrote some out. We dine out for nearly every meal and my comments are not overstated.",

All in all, I am not caring of how I got here, but glad I came. It's a great Farm to Table place that has great fresh food. I came in on a Saturday for Brunch. It is a BYOB FYI and I was able to get  here about 20 mins before opening; I actually beat some locals!  Shortly after I arrived and about 5 mins before opening the crowds built and as soon as I sat down the place was filled, so I was pleased to be the FIRST one through the door.  On this day I ordered the Oysters Napoleon with two poached eggs on french bread and a side of grits with some great blended chicory coffee. It was all easily devoured, but the take away that I LITERALLY took away was the hot sauce that they have.  I was able to buy 4 bottles of hot sauce from them because it is so good there. The bottles are small and the flavors are fresh, so if you need some extra they will sell them to you.  I enjoy eating at Farm to Table places and the gentlemen here do some really GREAT work with flavors. It was a great way to start the day by eating here.",
