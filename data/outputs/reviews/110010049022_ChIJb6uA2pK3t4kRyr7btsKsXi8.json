When we arrived, we decided to sit at the bar. Our bartender  Andres was friendly and hospitable. We enjoyed the The Eleanor cocktail, which consisted of a blend of Tito's vodka, St. Germain, pea flower simple syrup, lemon, and soda. It was light, fruity, sweet, and tart. In addition to a cocktail, I enjoyed a bowl of Maryland Crab and Corn Chowder, which consisted of thick, rich and creamy stock abundant with lump blue crab meat, sweet yellow corn, carrot, celery, onion, bacon, and old bay. It was served with toasted focaccia garlic bread. It was delicious and quite flavorful. I can't wait to return for more chowder.",

He proceeded to help new customers who walked up to the bar and stood on the side of us. After another 10 minutes of being completely ignored, we decided to get up and head home.  We couldn\u2019t help but feel as though the bartender (who was right in front of us nearly the whole time) was purposefully ignoring us because we\u2019re gay, while making an effort to help the two or three straight couples that just walked up and got served right away.  It was such an unfortunate experience, and despite the fact that we used to stop in here from time to time (we live next door), we don\u2019t plan on coming back.

I would suggest either option.  The customer service in the dining room is exceptional.  The staff is professional and caters to your every need.  The menu is rather limited, but the food we ordered was served with great care and precision.  We ordered the steak burger sliders as an appetizer.  There were three and they were served without sauce.  They only had a pickle on them.  I was not a fan, but my husband and sin loved them.  We also ordered the Delegate Burger as an entree.  The burgers were DELICIOUS.  I was not sure if I would like the garlic mayonnaise,  but it was a perfect accompaniment to the sandwich.  The rooftop menu differs from the dining room menu.  We only ordered drinks on the rooftop.  The view on the rooftop is amazing.  The menu is moderately pricey, but it is understandable for the location.   I would dine here again.",

Despite being next to the Washington Convention Center, the restaurant is utterly incapable of managing business clientele. I gave the restaurant two chances. Both were very bad from a business lunch perspective.  We had a reservation with our clients, planned to fall between other meetings (obviously). We were told the wait was 20 minutes even with reservation. No apologies, no consideration. That\u2019s their normal policy. Reservations also have a wait time. Unbelievable. We were actually sat 35 minutes after our reservation. Again, no apologies. Once we were sat, no one came and greeted us or gave us water for 10 minutes, until we caught someone\u2019s attention. The food then took very long to come out, and two of the orders were wrong! We asked for boxes because we then did not have time to eat before our next meetings. We asked for boxes 3 times before we were finally brought them, again with a long wait. I spoke with the manager about this appalling experience and his excuse was \u201ca lot of people made reservations at that time.\u201d  Astounding.  The following day, I went for a late lunch with a colleague. We figured it couldn\u2019t possibly be as bad as the previous day. Despite being much less busy, everything still took an incredibly long time. The hosts at the front desk literally argued in front of us about who would take us to the table without even looking at us or acknowledging how unprofessional they were being. The food took a very long time to come to our table. Our server was never around and no one knew who he was when we asked other people.  And I truly cannot believe how badly everything was run for a restaurant that is across the street from the Convention Center.  The food was okay. Once everyone had the food they actually ordered it was alright. Overpriced and not very flavorful but okay. The servers were nice people, but very slow in service and clearly not under good management.  If you expect any quality in timing and service, go literally anywhere else.",

Looking to stop by and checkout the new restaurant for dinner.  We were checking out the menu and two of the three items listed as vegan, have animal products in them, at least according to the menu...?  Do you guys not know what vegan is, or was it a menu typo?",
