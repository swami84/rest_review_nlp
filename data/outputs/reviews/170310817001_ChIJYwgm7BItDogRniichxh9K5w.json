Their patio is SOOOOO warm, for outdoor dining purposes, this was my fave experience, i didn't feel bothered at all.

So good I had two. I then asked him about the spinach pillows and his reaction said it all. They were superb!! Highly, highly recommend them. Everything was great, the ambiance, service, food and the prices. I will definitely be returning for more great service and mouthwatering food!",

Our server gave us a Polaroid camera to use for photos and surprised my friend with a birthday cake macaroon and dessert shot. If you're looking for a unique, fun experience, order the Parron!!!!

One of the issues was timing. The instant you placed an order, it came out of the kitchen within seconds. I would assume they will get better with spacing things out and timing as staff gets acclimated because as I mentioned it was opening night. We ended up figuring this out relatively early in the meal so we just waited to place second and third courses until we were basically ready to eat them because as I said it would come out instantly after. The biggest issue and the reason for my rating is actually due to safety precautions or lack thereof. They placed us at a table in the corner closest to the kitchen. While this is normally my favorite seat in any restaurant, I had a hard time enjoying my food seeing what was going on behind the scenes. The line cooks were wearing masks, but these were NEVER covering their noses. They took them off regularly to communicate with one another right over people's food. Additionally, there was a man (I would have to assume the owner or someone in close with the chef) who was taken back to the kitchen looking over everyone's food WITHOUT ANY MASK!!!! It was concerning on so many levels. We did inform our waiter and the manager of this who \"handled\" the situation but overall it made me uneasy and unable to enjoy my meal. I will likely be back because the food was delicious.... but certainly not until COVID-19 is over.",

Other than those minor hiccups, everything we had was fantastic. The grilled sweet corn, while seemingly simple, was awesome.
