The patio had little heaters by each table, and the heaters did a great job of heating the space. The indoor space is quiet and charming - exposed brick, tall ceilings, a little small and narrow. Would be good for a special occasion date.  All of the food was great. And the wine went well with the meal as well. The service w felt fairly European (a little slow at times, but then you don't feel rushed through the meal either). The salted caramel ice cream in particular was what dreams are made of. Was a little disappointed that the French onion soup wasn't on the menu, but that just means I'll have to go back another time.",

We started with the escargot and stuffed silver dollar mushrooms. They were both perfect. For mains, we got the Bouef Bourguignon and Marmite du Pecheur. These were excellent choices. The beef in the Bourguignon was tender but not drive and paired perfectly with the noodles. There were also huge pieces of jambon, adding to the flavor. The Pecheur has a large variety of seafood and the stew that it was served in cleverly rounded the dish together. For dessert we got the chocolate mousse and crepes. The mousse was airy and fluffy, a perfect level fo sweetness. The crepe had caramelized apples and was made to perfection. I\u2019m not usually much of a dessert guy, but these two dishes were phenomenal and totally worth trying! If you are craving french cuisine in the nation\u2019s capital, I highly recommend visiting Le Grenier. You will not be disappointed.",

However, I cannot take anything away from the taste of the flank steak which was very good! It's a shame, we're not far from having something good.

While celebrating our anniversary and after enjoying Washington DC for the whole day,  we decided to dress up nicely and visit this amazing restaurant not having a clue of the amazing evening we were about to experience. As soon as we got there were were very greeted in a very nicely way and explained the new sanitary protocols that they are following to prevent any spread of COVID-19.  We were offered a beautiful table but we asked if it was possible to eat at the bar and they had no problem with that. The ambience is super romantic and rustic, the music... Oh my God!!! Everything was perfect for our celebration the place fit perfectly to the kind of day we were wanting to have. We had delicious appetizers; Encornets \u00e0 la Tomate: Jumbo calamari stuffed with andouille sausage, tomato-cayenne sauce, Escargots de Bourgogne: Snails in parsley-garlic butter in a parsley sauce, Calamari filled with sausage over a delicious  sauce, and also an  Avocat Cocktail: Stuffed avocado with marinated tuna salad, Grilled shrimp, cocktail sauce stuffed avocado with marinated tuna salad and a shrimp. As we kept enjoying our delicious red wine and sparkling water main course came along. We eat  Le Jarret Fou wich is a slow braised Pork shank, parsnip potato puree, summer vegetables and port wine sauce. We were encouraged to leave some space for dessert.  So we did  :). And it was totally worth it. It was very hard to stop eating that amaizn pork meat and that combination fo beautifully done vegetables but those crepes we were served they are TO DIE FOR! Mina was a Chichouette:  Homemade Wild berries marmalade, Chantilly, Wild berry sauce, pistachio ice cream and my husband's had the Abricotier: Rosemary caramelized fresh apricot, hazelnut lavender ice cream, Chantilly. They served us some Champagne and delious coffee at the end of our night. I am so greatful for this amazing and unforgettable evening. Thank you Adam and Chef Emmanuel for making our day even more special. We will see each other soon. Blessings!!!",

Everything here was poor, from the flat cocktails to the dry appetizers to the entrees. The price point is moderate for DC but far too much for what you\u2019re offered. The seafood dish at $28 consisted of three shrimp and two scallops, overcooked, and a small ball of the worst restaurant risotto I\u2019ve ever had.  Service was alright, albeit a bit confused.  Maybe the worst dining experience I\u2019ve ever had in DC?  We have so many wonderful restaurants, honestly I\u2019m curious how this place is still open.",

Sadly the potatoes and carmelized onions with that were plated with the burger were WAY too garlicky!! To the point where I was having potatoes with my minced garlic. I love garlic but you lost all flavor of the potatoes and carmelized onions and the garlic eventually was more burn than flavor. It was really a shame as the bun and burger were exquisite. I would give them another try but would stay away from anything they have that lists garlic as part of the dish description.",

I typically don't comment on these types of things but the music choice was very good as well adding to the atmosphere without taking anything away from the conversation. The staff were extremely friendly as well. Overall I'd say that this establishment truly earned the five star rating.",

Weird layout of the tables (we were sandwiched between the live band and the counter). Tiny table and chairs, but that could pass as \"authentic\". Decent service yet chaotic: I counted EIGHT people running around tables and the place was not very busy, it seemed like a lot of traffic and disorganized movement. We ordered two starters and a big charcuterie plate to share after that. It all came at the same time making the little table very crammed.  The escargots were bitter (which generally means they weren't cleaned properly at the source) but the rest of the dishes were good.  What I found pretty out of place was getting paper napkins (really???!)... Lastly the $10 glass of wine was served in the tiniest wine glass I've ever seen. Good wine selection however.  The live music (classic French songs) was a nice touch, but the acoustic guitar with an amplified voice made it quite loud for tables close to it. I'd go for full acoustic if I were them.  I'd probably go back to try the bar and give their drinks a go, but all and all the experience was bland. The bill was surprisingly decent however. Lots of potential I think, but needs better management and a more defined direction.",

She was praising the food so much, so I had high expectations. Her salad Endives aux m\u00fbres was plain and bitter, and my Cr\u00eape Provence had enormous amount of black pepper on pears that it was almost burning my mouth. My friend had Marmite du p\u00eachu, which was delicious and I had Saumon flip flop. My goat cheese tart was so dry, not enjoyable despite creamy goat cheese. I personally did not like cucumber sorbet, but it was well made. What made us upset the most, is after we finished out dinner, we were expecting deserts. Waiters took away the dishes, and then their French manager came to our table, and put cutlery right on the table full of bread crumbs. I've been to at least few hundred restaurants in my life, in even cheap diners won't let this happen. It was so disgusting - clean cutlery on our dirty table, we lifted them and wiped the table ourselves. The place was moderately busy, and even if it would have been - there is no excuse for this, sorry. The food was nothing superb, I had better experience.",

What??? The bread they serve is AMAZING but they order it somewhere else. Our first serving of mussels was ok- they were quite small and didn't seem extremely fresh. But white sauce was delicious and we came in super hungry so we ordered the second pot. This one was much better - fresh mussels and larger in size. We both noticed the difference instantly without discussing. So overall I'd say it is a nice place. I just hope this kind of quality inconsistency was accidental. Also, I really DON'T like that neighborhood:( There are other amazing places if you go specifically for mussels and draft beer in Cleveland park, for example. All you can eat deal wasn't mind blowing either.",

We spent some time catching up and while we were deciding what we would like to eat, we asked for bread and butter- usually a staple in French restaurants. We were told that unless we planned to order we could not have any because it was complimentary to those who ate. Of course we were planning to order!  When the server returned we again asked for bread and butter while we finished making our dinner selections. He responded by saying that because we had taken so long to order that we would have to be out in the next thirty minutes (only thirty-five minutes had passed).  I was taken aback and asked to speak to his manager.  I wish it had ended there. The manager came over and we explained what happened- that we were planning to order, asked for bread and butter while we were trying to making up our minds etc. Instead of saying there was a misunderstanding, she reiterated the server by saying we need to leave the dinning room. That if we weren't going to eat we had to leave. Mind you we were planning to order and had already ordered $30 of worth of wine.  It was a horrible experience. I have worked in many restaurants before, and I never would have treated guests this way. I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. It was so strange. We ended up leaving without eating anything as a result.",

        "caption": "This is one of the best experiences I had at a french restaurant. The appetizers were exceeded our expectations. The Escargots de Bourgogne was a flavorful experience, and the La petite ferme was delightful. The entrees, cheese and pate were also fantastic. The pate is highly recommended. The duck leg confit was delectable. The highlight however was desert. The rhubarb and plumb sweet crepe (Odette) was the highlight of a delicious and romantic evening. Even the small detail of the bread was superb, fresh out of the oven bread with a hard crust. The price was moderate for DC, but the quality of the food. The wait staff is attentive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is a mix of classic romantic and quirky cafe. This may sound a bit like a contradiction, but it works very well for the restaurant.  This is the perfect restaurant for a special romantic occasion or a small gathering of close friends. Highly recommended.",
