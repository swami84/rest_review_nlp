It's a great place to eat as you get to look at all the decor whilst you do so. The food is pretty great too, myself and my girlfriend got a milkshake each (as you would in a diner), with a chili cheese dog, a Hula burger and a side of fries for main. The milkshakes are amazing and the bonus was that she made so much, we got the extra so basically a second drink free. The chili dog and burger were great, just found them to be a little in the small side. The fires however were quite large, deffinately able to share between 2. Great experience, great staff/owners, great food. Highly recommend this place.",

This restaurant serves American Food, and drink menu that will take you way back when the root beer became popular in USA. I had the \"Scooby-Doo\" Hot Dog, which is a Pizza hot dog, and oh boy that hot dog had lots of yummy marinara sauce and the perfect ratio of pepperoni & parmesan cheese.  Ask for a fork and a knife cuz you will need it. Among all the memorabilia that is for sale. The place has a ouside view to a very busy street. You may also play trivia while you wait for your delicious meal. Did I mention the music? They play a variety of music videos from the 50's, 60's... and today's. Come and check it out, your favorite celebrity memorabilia might be here.",

There is a lot od memorabilia available to look at and purchase, some of it for decent prices. However the dining aspect leaves much to be desired. The serving staff was rude and terse, cutting off our drink order to tell us we have to order at the counter, after we were sat and given menus. Three employees (and possibly the manager) sat and watched me write down all our orders and bring it up to THEM. The food was decent but overpriced, and while paying the check the manager hovered over the pinpad pressuring us to leave a tip. And to make it worse, the $100 we spent buying merchandise was factored into the tip amount. They wanted to sucker us into paying a tip for OUR shopping as well as for the \"service\" they provided which was at best no service and at worst downright disrespectful. Best to avoid this one altogether. There's a lovely Burger King a few feet away where you can get the same quality food and better service.",

We finished out first round and as we were ordering a second. A woman came and stopped our server. My boyfriend had a couple sips left of his drink and this woman (later found to be the manager) refused to make him another one until he was completely done. She did not smile. Was extremely rude and had a negative demeanor. We had another drink and left. Every time we spoke to a server etc. the manager would stare us down and it was very uncomfortable. We handed a tip to one of our servers and she almost seemed frightened. Stating last time someone tried to give her a tip her manager took it away. We went to pay at the front and the manager was starring at us from across the diner. We placed the tip in the jar only hoping it gets to our servers. Awesome place but the manager totally killed the vibe and cut our visit short with her negative attitude.",

The prices were somewhat high to begin with, and the food did not warrant such prices, especially the deserts (10 bucks for a plain brownie sundae with two scoops of ice cream and nothing special about it).  The Hawaiian Pizza my wife and I ordered had cracker like crust and was a rather plain pizza.  The food was served Luke warm and was cold before we could finish it.  The waitress who served us was brief and aloof.  My wife asked for her food to be boxed, and not only did the waitress not box the food for her, but she brought out a piece of tin foil instead that was too small to use.  Who does that?  I never have seen a restaurant not have a box before.  We asked for more tin foil, and we never received it after about 10 minutes, so we asked again about the tin foil.  The waitress acted like we were inconveniencing or annoying her with our request we had made 10 minutes prior.  The bill without alcohol ended up being about the same for a much higher quality restaurant with alcohol.  Upon leaving, my wife had to use the restroom, and all they had was an access code to a restroom that was located in an outdoor shopping center that had mold on the sink.  The hot water didn't work either.",

I must say that this diner is in the heart of Waikiki-where a simple burger can easily cost 12.00.  I went 3 times-the decor is fantastic, the service was great every time, and the food was not only good, it was priced well below the competition. I have absolutely no complaints & would not only recommend going-I would go back in a heartbeat.",

The first time was when we first arrived in Waikiki as we were just scoping out the local food scene, The owner was very chatty and polite at the time and we said we would come back to eat while we were in Waikiki. Well, we did go back, BIG MISTAKE!! The owner totally ignored us when we walked in so  we just sat at a table, ordered a couple of drinks then proceeded to be constantly pressured by the waitress to order food, It seemed we just weren't allowed to sit and enjoy a drink while we decided on what to order. In the end I ordered a burger and fries just to get her off our backs! When the burger eventually came out, it was swimming in some sort of liquid, Yuk! After about 15 mins, the owner came over and bluntly asked if we would be ordering ice cream. When I replied no, the unfinished basket of fries I was still eating was whipped away and the check was thrown on the table (we didn't even ask for it) by the owner, who didn't even bother to ask if everything was ok, as he turned his back and walked away. We will be going back to Waikiki soon but we will give Rock Island a wide berth and we have told everyone we know who is going to Hawaii to do the same!! The owner is a douchbag!",
