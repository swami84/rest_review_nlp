When asked about seating, my friends and I were given the run-around from the host and bartenders. When finally seated, the manager came and rudely stated \"A group has brought this table, you will need to move\". When we were seated the bartender who seated us explained that the table was a community table and other parties may possibly be seated with us. I don't appreciate that the messages did not align and the poor manner in which we were addressed by the manager. It's not what she said, but the way in which she said it.  Additionally,  we met a group who had purchased Mimosas but were about to leave. They expressed that they were unable to finish their picture and left it on our table. The bartender rushed to our table, confiscated our drinks, and took the Mimosa picture, as well. AGAIN, the issue is not that she took the drinks, but she failed to have a reasonable conversation with us (patrons who spent over $230) about their policy on sharing Mimosas. She was extremely rude and unprofessional. The customer service was subpar and I won't be patronizing this establishment again.",

They only have buffet style food and dont even offer a la carte menu! Let me start with the ridiculous price , $45 for brunch, $25 for mimosas  like seriously?! The buffet was mediocre, the only thing that i like was the waffles and the chicken. I decided to opt out of the mimosas cause i wasn't about to spend over $80 for brunch!  I am only giving two stars because the food is tasteless, the customer service was horrible.. we had a girlfriend that is vegan and we ask the manager if we could get her a plate of kale salad with fruits but she refused and told us she will have to pay full price for the brunch, mind you she ordered the $25 mimosas so its not like she was just there not spending money.  Definitely wouldn't come back for brunch! The only thing this place is good for is if you want to come dance and have a great time!",

I went with my friends and we had a couple drinks, we noticed throughout the evening that the bartender charge us extra drinks that we didn\u2019t order. When we checked our bills after the credit card was swiped, without a receive, we noticed that they chargers was extra and we paid 60 dollars for 3 JW black label with coke. When we asked to the bartender, she ignored us and after a couple minutes pretending to be busy making drinks, she came to fix her mistake answering \u201coh you want the other drink or refund?\u201d... that was our first drink, so we weren\u2019t drunk at all... I can\u2019t imagine how much money they can charge to the people who are drunk!! It\u2019s unfortunate that bartenders take advantage of customers of that way. EVERYONE CHECK YOU BILLS AT THE END PLEASE!!! Don\u2019t let that happen to you as well!!!",

I said sure and registered for my free ticket which is a limited time offer. Fast forward to Sunday, I get to the front of the line and they were no longer honoring there Event brite promotion even though I was there before the time. They then switched it from 6pm to a 5pm cut off. Several others decided not to go in because of  this and the fact that they now charged a $20 entry. Very misleading promotion, the security act as though they don't know what's going on but collect the cover from anyone who doesn't require explaination. Then they yelled at a young man for inquiring. I still decided to pay and go inside as it was for celebrating a friend birthday. I was hope to pay for at least a good time. Upon entry you see the illusion of the packed house is mostly due to the lack of space and positioning of ropes inside. Great marketing but bad for for paid customers. The first DO they had was terrible  switching song late or too fast. Transition between track was terrible. The second DO got alot better , way better music. A few NFL stars came through though ( went to my HS and college) so it was to see old acquaintances. But I wouldn't recommend  unless You are into paying for free promoted events with limited space and limited fun",

Not what I\u2019m looking for in a Sunday afternoon. The server was pretty inattentive but I guess they don\u2019t have to be good when they automatically charge you gratuity for a party of 2. DJ. was nice but music was loud and a bit jarring for brunch. Looks like they should scrap brunch altogether because it\u2019s clearly not their focus. Bill was over $100 w/o the bottomless mimosas. I don\u2019t drink.  I was really disappointed. This place is all hype no substance.",

I didn't like that when we went they seemed to not have any of the beers on their list.  Also we sat against the wall/booth and I was sitting on the booth side and boy friend was opposite me and our waitress stood almost behind him reading off specials or beers.  I had to tell her excuse me you are way too far away I can't hear a word you are saying! Besides the drinks and waitress I really liked this place because of the food if it werent for the tasty food I wouldnt go back",

They have a lot of tables available for bottle service, but I honestly think they have too many tables.  Now for the bad: the business model is very scummy and everything tends to be expensive. I paid $13 for a simple mixed drink in a 8 oz cup and $9 for a corona extra. I learned that they automatically include the tip, so I didn't even both tipping. Also, the crowd seemed sketchy.  The last straw was when someone attempted to force me to \"tip\" to use the restroom. When I went, there was no one in the restroom, not even an attendant. Yet, after I left, a sketchy person attempted to shake me down for a \"tip\" to use the restroom. I initially brushed him off and went my merry way. That person then convinced a large bouncer to intimidate me into paying the \"tip\". Normally, I wouldn't have any problem paying the \"tip\" if an attendant helped me out, but I had my own reasons to leave the bar at that time. I left the bar without tipping and I will never return again.  Overall, this bar is very sketchy for their tipping practices and for the atmosphere.",

Moreover, our party was the first to sit in this establishment and place our orders. However it took at least 45 minutes for some of the plates to come out and one of the plates had to be sent back three times because they kept placing an item onbthe plate that the customer was allergic to, and they were told that.  Confusingly, half of the meals were lost between the time the orders were placed and somewhere in the kitchen.  As a result, four of us had to cancel our orders after waiting for them to come out for over a 1.5 hours of waiting.  Moreover, we had a dirty glass that had a lip stick mark on the rim of the glass that we were expected to drink out of. My cup of coffee was inedible, it tasted like liquid cool, I had to ask for cream and one of the servers took 10 minutes to bring the heavy cream to me. When he came back, my coffee was ice cold and he had a very unhappy look on his face. Perhaps, he has the condition of  \"RBF\", I don't know; but it was very unappealing and disrespectful! I had to send the coffee back and have it removed from my bill. Not to mention,  we observed other tables be seated, eatting their food and leave without our meals even being cooked.  I felt bad for the waitress because it was likely the kitchen's fault but this was unacceptable. Surprisingly, a manager never came over to check in with us or to see why we were unhappy until after we were here for over 2 hours of being very unhappy. Will update with details...",

        "caption": "If you like to eat sea creatures by the truckload this is prob your place...if you would like even the semblance of friendly and attentive service, you will  be sorely disappointed. Their \"half price\" (almost) everything includes all drinks and the raw bar.  That really is the best deal in Dupont.  The space is classic with lots of wood and brass with some outside tables on those nice days, with a full open front that can let in a nice breeze (as well as the sounds of the busy street).  The half price shrimp cocktail at $5 is a steal, and comes inventively prepared on a bed of tangy cocktail sauce topped with delicious lemon zest.  The clams were too fishy and tough--all 3 people at the table agreed, but it could have been a rough batch.  Drinks came at a glacial pace, and once happy hour was over, servers disappeared.  Gryphon is not quite ready for prime time.",
