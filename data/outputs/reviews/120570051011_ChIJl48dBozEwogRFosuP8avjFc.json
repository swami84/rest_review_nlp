The only thing I can say is that, it\u2019s better than the Tropical Smoothies back in South Florida. I\u2019ve ordered a turkey bacon ranch sandwich 2/3 times I\u2019ve came here, and it was pretty good! It was made nicely, had the right amount of everything, very filling. NOW THE SMOOTHIES. I\u2019ve only ordered the Avocolada & Kiwi Quencher in total at this place, doesn\u2019t take watered down + flavorful. My only problem is the amount that\u2019s given. They don\u2019t put enough ice in their smoothies to fill it up to the top, so I\u2019m left paying more for what I actually got. It\u2019s happened to me all times I\u2019ve been there and I hope it gets better because that can be a small dealbreaker for me with this place.  Customer service is alright, no one really looks the happiest when they\u2019re there. But I find that to be a pattern at all of the Tropical Smoothies I\u2019ve been to in my lifetime. Could be better though.  The cleanliness was up to par with this restaurant; no trash on the floors, lobby was kept nice and neat with the chairs pushed in. The bathrooms were pretty clean too, nothing to outrageously complain about. When it comes to the size of a restaurant, it\u2019s better to maintain cleaning when it\u2019s smaller.  Overall, I would keep coming here. I just don\u2019t like the portion amount of smoothie they actually give me.",

The woman behind the counter thought it was funny and told me it wouldn\u2019t be ready for another 10 minutes! On top of that her customer service was horrible. The women behind me went up to order and the cashier literally did not acknowledge her for 5 minutes. The cashier was on the phone and made the women wait there after finally saying it would be a minute. At this point the line is out the door! Why don\u2019t they have more ppl working at LUNCH TIME!?
