        "caption": "I have to do right by this place, as it was one of the first pupuserias in DC proper!  My name's Kim Arias and my parents were the ones who first opened Moses Carry-Out. My dad is Moses Arias and mom is Imelda Arias and they are immigrants from El Salvador. Together, they decided to open a predominantly Salvadorian, \"hole in the wall\" carry-out in Logan Circle, back in 1988. As you can imagine, Logan Circle, in the 80's and 90's, was very different from what it is today. Today, Moses' Carry-Out is Aveda Logan 14.  After owning the restaurant for 8.5 years (1988-1996), my parents sold the business to someone named Victor (my dad says he was Peruvian). Victor kept it for about 2 years (1996-1999) and then the business was sold to Luis Hernandez, who is also Salvadorian, and he ran the business from 1999 to 2005/6. My dad believes the business was closed permanently around 2005/6.  Similar to Juan (from the reviews), I'm attached to this place. I grew up inside this carry-out from ages 1-9. After school, I'd hang out in this business, do some homework, watch B+W shows on a portable TV, and greet customers. I recognized our regulars, most of which lived or worked in Logan Circle. I'm eternally grateful to the folks that chose to support this small business. By doing so, they also supported the immigrant community.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For historical and nostalgic sake, I'm posting the original menu here. First and foremost, Salvadorian food was the main cuisine.  SALVADORIAN: 1. Pupusas: Cheese, Revueltas (pork and cheese), Chicharon (pork only) 2. Pescado Frito: Black sea bass, Tilapia (This is fried, whole fish. I remember going to the Maine Avenue Fish Market with my parents to buy the fish.) 3. Yuca con Chicharron (yuca with pork) 4. Bistec Encebollado \"a lo estilo Savadore\u00f1o\" (steak in a tomato sauce) 5. Carne Asada 6. Pollo Asado 7. Pollo Guisado (chicken in a stew) 8. Costilla de Cerdo (spare ribs) 9. Tamales de Pollo, Salvadorian style 10. Tamales de Elote, Salvadorian style 11. Sopa de Res, Salvadorian style (beef soup) 12. Sopa de Mondongo, Salvadorian style (tripe stew) 13. Salvarodian breakfast A) \"Plato Tipico\": refried beans, queso fresco, eggs, chorizo, tortillas, fried plantains B) Chorizo con Huevos, served with tortillas and refried beans  14. Desserts: Quesadilla Salvadore\u00f1o, Arroz con Leche, Budin, Salvadorian style 15. Drinks: Horchata, Tamarindo, Mara\u00f1on 16. \"Salvadorian\" Fruit Smoothies: Coconut, Mango, Mamey (Sapote), Banana, Pineapple (My parents say these were super popular.)  AMERICAN: 1. Breakfast all day: Breakfast burritos, Breakfast sandwiches (diff styles), Pancakes, French Toast 2. Lunch + Dinner: Steak and Cheese, Fish Sandwiches, Hamburgers, Cheeseburgers, Deli sandwiches (various kinds), Tuna Sandwiches, Fries (FYI: Mom told me to note that the turkey sandwiches were made with real turkey, not deli meat.) 3. A bit of Tex-Mex: Tacos, Burritos ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  This list is from Moses and Imelda Arias as this menu is from the 1988-1996 era. If anyone who lived/worked in Logan Circle in the late 80s to late 90s reads this and remembers this small shop, my parents would like to say \"thank you\" for your patronage! They remember many customers by name, and still tell stories about the restaurant.",
