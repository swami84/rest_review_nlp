I had the City Slicker, with seared foie gras, Swiss cheese, a black truffle pesto, caramelized onions, foie gras mayo, and crispy prosciutto.  Yes, its pricey at $24 but worth it if you're in the mood to treat yourself.  I paired with the bourbon and vanilla spiked shake and I was in heaven.

This is really a small corner bar with about 12 tables. There are about 4 booths and a handful of tables. Luckily there was a  table that could fit our group of 6. Decorated in mainly a blue color and simple tables. Service was very good and fairly quick. We started with beers. I was really happy they had my favorite Haymarket's Blood Orange Blonde Ale.  We each ordered either the Maillard or The Grand.  I went with the Maillard. The beef patty is topped with Crispy Onions, Bacon & Onion Jam, Cheddar, Pickles, and Dijon mayo. It was fantastic. Tons of crunchy onions, the bacon jam was a perfect compliment. My husband ordered The Grand and he enjoyed his burger as well. This burger is Beef, Blue Cheese, Barbecue Sauce, Pickles, Caramelized Onions. While he enjoyed it, I think all those crispy onions on mine left him a little jealous. Both burgers were paired with really crispy fries.  We also order the warm cookie. It\u2019s three cookies in one. The chocolate chip is clearly the standout of the three. I loved that it was served in a hot skillet. This is a must order...I mean you already ate a massive burger, what\u2019s a few more calories? This was easily a homerun. I can't wait to return.",

I visited for lunch on a Saturday and had no trouble getting a table - the place was actually pretty empty. The restaurant is not huge but is a fun space with bar seating, booths, and regular tables. There are 6-8 beers on tap and probably 20+ in bottles. Service is very good\u2026 they have regular servers as well as a water guy which is clutch.  My wife and I ordered the El Jefe and the Maillard.  The Maillard was essentially an elevated take on the classic greasy dive bar onion burger. They really load it up with the crispy onions which makes the texture awesome and the burger look like an advertisement when it comes to your table. The beef was very tender all the way through - there were no remotely dry or crunchy areas.  El Jefe is a delicious mess. Again the beef was moist throughout, and then you get the fried egg and chipotle mayo on top. I\u2019m fairly certain they make the chipotles in house because the flavor was stronger, spicier, and smokier than anything you would get in a can. It\u2019s just awesome.  We asked for a side of it for our fries which I would HIGHLY recommend.  After finally trying this place I\u2019m confident all of the burgers will be great.I fully intend to return to try their award winning foie gras and truffle pesto burger.",

The burger was just okay - two thick and juicy patties, somewhat bland onion rings, pickles and lots of white sauce. The patties we're just shy of being pub burger thick and the juices overwhelmed the bottom bun, quickly turning it to mush.  My preference is for  thinner patties with more caramelization so take that into account. I also felt it was underseasoned. The fries were good and the prices were reasonable. Nothing on the beer list really appealed to me. My wife felt her tacos we're just OK.",

The good: There are some heavy-hitting restaurants in the nearby area, but Maillard is a great spot for the middle-of-the-road consumer who doesn\u2019t want to spend too much or too little. The atmosphere and vibes fit that bill too, but are still inviting and comfortable. The menu has some typical pub fare, but my girlfriend and I went with the fried chicken sandwich and the Maillard\u2019s version of a sloppy joe, respectively. Both were great in their own way, and the fries to go along with them were crispy and hot. The portion sizes are perfect as well, and neither of us left too stuffed.  The not-so-good: For what it is, it\u2019s a little too overpriced. And, depending on what you\u2019re looking for, the menu can seem pretty limiting.

        "caption": "If I could give this place a 3.5 star rating, I would. However, I will vote down just so it can garner attention to my biggest concern coming here.  First, I absolutely commend this restaurant because it has excellent burgers. I especially came here because it was one of the only non-chain restaurants in the Chicago area that had the Impossible Burger 2.0, a plant-based burger patty that's been revamped by Impossible Foods to taste even more like a meat burger. I thought Maillard Tavern's spin on the Impossible Burger was absolutely delicious and well-made, albeit a bit pricey to reflect the quality. That burger, however, tastes almost exactly like a meat burger.  However, I would like to stress that the staff could do a much better job handling peak hours. We arrived there on a Saturday evening which, due to the popularity of the restaurant, meant that the restaurant was packed. When we, along with another couple looking to dine there, arrived, none of the staff walked up to take our names or anything. Instead, we just stood there for 15 minutes not knowing what to do, and eventually someone walked up to take our names for the waitlist. The staff should be way more receptive and transparent about the waitlist process, because otherwise they lose so many customers who get ignored and leave to go to other fine restaurants elsewhere. So I would recommend to the staff: please, please do a better job handling heavier traffic.  For those who are seeking the food for its reputation during peak hours, I would just recommend ordering take-out if that's possible. Trying to dine during peak hours will inevitably result in getting ignored by the staff while waiting for a seat.",
