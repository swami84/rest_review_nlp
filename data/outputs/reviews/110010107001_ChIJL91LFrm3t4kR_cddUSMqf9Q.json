The first time I called the only reservation that was open was at 9:30 PM. Two minutes later, I made my second call to the restaurant, and was given an 8:30 PM reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant we were placed in a OK table. The server was not knowledgeable on the menu. I asked about a certain drink and she could not give me an answer to what was in the drink. We ordered our food and I had a question about the difference between two salads. I received a condescending answer as to the two different salads. When I received my New York strip, it was swimming in the liquid from the resting of the steak. The sides we ordered were cold and not to standard. Needless to say very disappointing. It took 30 minutes just to get a check and another 15 for the return of my card. This is just an example of a poor manager managing a upscale restaurant. I have been to multiple Morton\u2019s before in major cities like Chicago, New York, LA, and this by By far has been the worst experience ever. I will not be returning to Morton\u2019s DC. Total disappointment.",

The bisque was creamy and had a strong lobster taste, and the steak was medium rare but very juicy and the meat was delicious. The glass of wine was also good with the food.

Unfortunately, the disrespectful treatment we received here was easily the worse one I've ever experienced in any restaurant. I've never felt this mistreated, even in a MacDonald's. First, they insisted on carding us, and they didn't accept our Quebec driver's licenses as proof, or images or our passports or other cards we had on our phones, and when we explained it to them that our hotel was 1 mile away they didn't care; I had to walk one mile and back to get the physical passports. Meanwhile, they left or party in the entrance area, and made them pay for a few poorly prepared drinks while waiting. They showed no courtesy in their tone, and on my return when I tried talking reasonably with the assistant manager, he kept brushing me of like they don't care about my business and we are free to leave. Since we were already there and it was pointless ruining our anniversary we ordered nonetheless. Service was slow, careless, and we kept getting sour looks by the staff like if we weren't welcome. I've worked in 5 star hotels and restaurants in my youth, and I would've never tested a customer this way. They offered no compensation, not even an appetizer or a drink. My wife told me it was the worst anniversary ever. Plus my $100 steak was overcooked, my gin and tonic tasted like a mojito, and the dessert chocolate cake I ordered which was advertised by the waiter as \"extremely moist\" was dryer than an automn leaf. It's like they take their clients for fools. For the process they charge, this place is a farce. If you want to go to an expensive restaurant in Washington DC, save yourself the terrible experience and go somewhere else. I would've given them 2 stars if the food was good, but even at half the price it wouldn't be worth it.",

The staff took my order, then when I arrived to pick up my order I was informed that one of the items I ordered was not on the menu for that day.  That was alright, a minor oversight, which is understandable.  Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the only error.  When we returned home to eat our dinner, we realized that they had also forgotten to give us the steak that we paid extra for, that was supposed to come with our \u201csteak salad\u201d that my wife ordered for dinner.  We basically paid $26 for probably a $1\u2019s worth of Romain lettuce and some dressing.  Additionally, the $70 porterhouse that I order \u201cmedium rare\u201d was at least medium well, maybe even we\u2019ll done and my wife\u2019s Lump Crab cakes were burnt...  it to Very disappointing for a $225 carry out dinner for two.  I have heard a ton of great things about Morton\u2019s, but I will not be returning.  I could have gone to Outback Steakhouse or Texas Roadhouse and gotten a much better prepared order and saved $100.",

I think Morton's in general has been on a downward slide in the past few years.  Their onion loaf used to be so yummy. I think they switched to something similar and not as tasty or hearty.  Their chopped salad used to be fresh. I think they're preparing it too far in advance and by the time it gets in front of you, parts can be wilted or mushy.  I usually get the bone-in ribeye. I got the Cajun ribeye this time. It was ok. A little tougher than I expected and not as flavorful as the bone-in.

They have a reasonable three course lunch special that would be $20-30 cheaper than ordering a la carte.  It's not my favorite steakhouse.

        "caption": "Thoroughly disappointed....  Fairness in reviews such as these offer interested patrons a fair 3rd party assessment of their experience. This is my experience...  We decided to dine with Morton\u2019s for the first time last night as it was closely chosen over two other steakhouse options within the DC Metro area. We went to Morton\u2019s off personal referrals. We were told it was an excellent steakhouse, and offered wonderful service. Mind you, it was our first time dining with Morton\u2019s. So, we were unfamiliar with the menu options. Also, let me set the tone here to say I am one that believes that if you have a debit card, or cash in hand, it shouldn\u2019t matter what you look like...but, this may just be the business mindedness of me. Anyway, we were snubbed for about 10 minutes before being greeted by our server. She was fairly pleasant, and I had to make myself clear several times that we had never dined here. I was dining here with my girlfriend and mother on short holiday. Both of them enjoy steak, but she (girlfriend) is very picky as to how she likes it cooked. The server was mostly accommodating to this. So at this point, the experience wasn\u2019t hateful. Then we enjoyed a nice conversation as we waited...I convinced the group and I it was going to be well worth the wait....being that it was about 45 minutes after being served our horderves.  I legitimately thought this would be the best steak I had the opportunity in eating. Luckily I\u2019m not a weatherman, or stock broker because my logic was far from the truth. Other than the steak tasting bland, and unnecessarily charred, this Ribeye had no noticeable marbling. I was honestly pretty disappointed, and the others in my party were pretty unenthusiastic about their options as well (2 filets). We chose 3 sharing sides...these were probably the best part of the meal. Then what took the cake here was not only the obnoxious alcohol/desert sales-pitch our server gave...but the way we were treated when my girlfriends debit card was geo-blocked because we were visiting as I mentioned. The server began getting hostile, inpatient, and refused to give her more than a second to simply unlock her banking app to validate the transaction. Then...wouldn\u2019t you know! She runs the card and it goes through no problem at all! Now! She is as chirper as possible, knowing her tip hangs in the balance.  No hard drinks, stuck with water. Final bill, $245. My group and I are all foodies, and I would gladly drop twice that on a Michelin Starred restaurant where you experience a well rounded culinary experience. I did not get a lick of that here. $245 gets me about 8 free ranged, organic steaks from my local butchery, and it also gets me a lot more smiling faces. Will not be back. This is a review, and it is purely opinion. But take it with caution if you are looking to dine here with exceedingly high expectations.",

I don't know why, but steak is consistently better at this Morton's. We ride Amtrak from NJ for no other reason than to dine and enjoy a cigar on the patio. A call ahead guarantees our porterhouse is hand selected, never ever over cooked or seasoned, and the kitchen always finds a way to send a message making us feel special. It's true, service on the patio can be imperfect. I suspect corporate is abusive of wait staff, as turnover is high and some servers are clearly unhappy. I blame Landry. We're experienced steakhouse patrons and no other steakhouse matches this for quality, consistency and personal warmth. We do welcome a more stable and happier wait staff.",
