The Red Curry was also bland and watery. Sushi rice and Hawaiian Fried Rice were very dry. The meats in all the entrees were rubbery. Food prices are waaay too much for this quality. Not worth the $70+ at all. I\u2019m so sad I wasted money. But now I know not to order from here again. I\u2019m only giving 2 stars because the food came on time.",

I became a frequent customer now with Covid, first I ordered to pick up for a few months then I started to do delivery when work at home became more frequent. Anyways I started ordering about three times a week or four \ud83d\ude2cI know, but I love sushi. I like to add cream cheese to my sushi rolls, so when I picked up my order at the restaurant sometimes I got charged extra and sometimes i didn\u2019t. Note that their mobile ordering style doesn\u2019t charge xtra for this. So when I started ordering delivery I expected no cream cheese but they ended up doing it anyways, which was great customer service. But then one day someone from the restaurant called me after I ordered delivery. They asked me if I wanted to leave a tip and I told them, I would at the door. They told me to add it on the card instead over the phone with him  because of Covid.. awkward moment tbh\ud83d\ude33discussing tips over the phone. So my total was about 20 dollars. I told them ok leave an even 25, cause I mean why is giving a tip at the door an issue now. Anyway, when I received my order, no cream cheese and they added more to their tip. Why not tell me something over the phone when they were asking for a tip, like hey cream cheese is more, do you wanna pay for it or just get the regular as is??? My total ended up being about $28. Like \ud83e\udd2c\ud83d\ude11... I tried calling back 2 times but they never answered. I felt targeted by my favorite sushi restaurant. Now I\u2019m in search of a different place.",

Cashier is rude, messes up the order, doesn\u2019t give what you ask for then rolls her eyes as if she\u2019s bothered to do her job.  This is was my review 3 years ago: Been here several times, and visited the Addison location once. Both the sushi and Thai menu are delicious. Pad Thai was very flavorful and big portion. This isn't a \"Chinese' restaurant as another reviewer whined about.",

Lady on the phone informed me that there would be a $6 delivery charge, which I thought was a bit extreme but I was starving so I didn\u2019t question it. I ordered an order of gyoza and two salmon avocado hand rolls. As 10:30 came around I had yet to receive my order, so I attempted to call the restaurant. No answer all 3 times I called. I resorted to using facebook messager to attempt to contact, and finally got a response. When the food arrived at 11 PM, the gyoza was freezing cold, and the salmon in the hand rolls was so chewy that it was inedible. I paid $27 for food I could not even eat, and I will not be ordering from Hands On again.",

I stopped in during lunchtime, and tried their lunch special which was an appetizer, an entree, and a drink for around $8. I tried the crab rangoon which was pretty good and the chicken pad thai which was also very good. The service was attentive. The atmosphere vibes well with the place. It was not crowded. I was able to walk in, sit down, and ordered right away. The lunch special is a good value for the money. I would definitely recommend this place and will come back soon.",

Mini veggie egg roll appetizer was OK, but no better than something I could buy in the freezer case at Costco.  Cucumber salad was quite spicy, but otherwise lacking flavor. It was just OK.  Pad Thai was just terrible. Worst I've ever had. It had an unrecognizable flavor, and the noodles were mush, as if they'd been left to boil about 15 minutes too long.  Chicken Basil is my favorite thai dish, but this stuff was super bland with no spice whatsoever. I'm not actually sure it WAS Chicken Basil, because there was hardly any basil in it.  All in all, this place gives nearby Ruk a run for the money in terms of uninspired Thai cuisine with zero love in it. The decor inside was nice, though. They should step up their food game to match, or they're not likely to last long.",
