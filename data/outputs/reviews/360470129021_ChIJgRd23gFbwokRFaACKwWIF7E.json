We were greeted immediately as my date & I walked through the door. They gave us menus (Brunch & regular Dine in menu)  to look at as they sanitized our table for us which I really appreciated. The tables were also separated by a plexiglass separating us from the next table.  To start off for drinks I ordered the Mimosa & my date had Chardonnay wine. For appetizers we decided to choose from the Dine in menu. Picked the lamb sliders which was good & my date chose the fried cauliflower wings with guava sauce. I say that guava sauce was everything!!  I wish had it on my lamb sliders.  For the main dish I went with the French toast which was made out of challah bread, cinnamon, orange zest, & bananas foster compote topping. The French toast alone was so good I didn\u2019t even use the syrup. So because the French didn\u2019t come with any side dishes I ordered the two egg plate which came with eggs home fries & mixed green, then a side order of turkey bacon. It was a lot of food but Everything was delicious!  My date decided to have the Rasta Pasta with salmon & asked for a side of guava sauce (it was that good) . After having 1 bite of it I was ready to eat some more off her plate!  To end things off I ordered their fire shots which I believe they call the Harry Potter Shots. Which is a great visual for social media. I definitely would come back here we both were extremely happy overall with our experience",

The cocktails are very tasty and give you the buzz you need. The ambiance and esthetics this restaurant is sexy and chic. Not to mention the food... AMAZING! There are vegan/vegetarian options as well, which I think is so dope. The bean & walnut  sliders are delicious. The lemon pepper swordfish is also delicious. The curried mussels were yum. The rasta pasta is flavorful and The \"Ella\" is my favorite cocktail. I feel like I'm being modest as I have had almost  everything on the menu. There are even items on the menu that started off the restaurant, but now no longer exist. Either way I have no complaints about the hospitality, service or the food.  This is a photo of the lobster ravioli and stuffed lobster tail with seafood fried rice.",
