The rooftop patio is covered so it makes for a great outdoor spot during covid yet also very comfortable temperature with the heat lamps! My favorite was the octopus, perfect flavor cooked over an oak wood flame I believe.  Giving 4 stars simply because the service was quite slow (over 2 hours to have a few small plates and a bottle of wine with a friend) and because we came quite early (6 pm reservation) on a Friday and they were already out of a lot of items. Probably all covid related so would definitely come back!!!",

I ordered a salad and ended up with a dip and pitas. Where were the Greek olives, the feta cheese, the greens?  I ordered a martini and the glasses do not have stems. Big bummer for me! This would never happen at Greek Islands. Just saying. Plus they didn't have Absolut vodka or Bombay Sapphire gin, my favorite choices for a martini.  The lamb chops were excellent, otherwise, I wouldn't have given it a single star. A 25% gratuity was added to the check, and although this is printed on the check, this is something that should be verbalized to avoid a double tip being added. Luckily, one of the individuals in my party alerted me to remove the 20% tip that I had added, after we were told that our time was up. Four words: I won't go back.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I would tip this amount normally, but what irritates me is that there is no warning. I ordered just drinks and was shocked when the bill came. Again, I know people are hurting, and would\u2019ve tipped something similar anyway, but you gotta let people know in advance or just include it in your menu prices. Also didn\u2019t care for the suggested 45 dollars per person at a tapas restaurant. Your customers are also affected by covid so some mutual understanding would serve us all well.

On top of this, we were CHARGED for the order he messed up and brought back to the kitchen without even touching the wrong dish. On top of this the server already gets 25% tip already on the bill regardless of his piss poor service of our table.

During this pandemic I've made an effort to support my neighborhood restaurants.  Today I ordered the lamb chop dinner medium and they were over cooked (well done ). I called to let them know and was told to get a replacement or refund I'd have to bring them back.  Again I order dinner from them frequently and instead of working with me or offering half off they asked me to come back out so they could see   the lamb chops were over cooked.  They have lost a long standing customer because of  not respecting my right to be safe. Would think during these times they would be a little more flexible with customers especially since this was their error. Bad move to turn customers off when your sales are at 10-30%. If they close they won't be missed",

By the time the waitress asked us if we wanted a drink, we had already received some dishes! The food was decent but kind of cold, which I suspect was due to our lazy server. We got the whole fish - it was not filleted - we got asked if we wanted it filleted, which we responded yes, and then it took another 15 minutes to bring it back out. By that time, the fish was lukewarm! We talked to the manager afterwards, and he was mostly unapologetic, blaming the poor service on the amount of people they had come in last minute \u2014 it was not that busy and other tables who came after us were served before us. This is not a cheap meal; it was $50+ a person. I would expect a much higher level of service for that price.  Do yourself a favor and don\u2019t waste your time \u2014 the servers here will certainly try.",

We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. The staff was friendly and attentive, at times overly attentive in my estimation. The appetizers were very tasty, my bowl of soup was fantastic, and the entrees ranged from good to superb. I feel the prices are slightly high - but I don't live in the city, so I may be off-base here. All that being said, I wasn't inclined to give Taxim five stars, nor was my wife when I asked for her input. But 4.5 stars may be more on the mark than 4. If you have a taste for Greek food, Taxim is definitely worth a try.",

Most people don't think of a Greek restaurant for breakfast, and their omission is your gain if you are willing to try something a bit different. It's a quiet Oasis in a neighborhood with 1 hour waits for brunch. It's a different spin on brunch for sure (they still have eggs and French toast etc) but delicious nonetheless.

Had to ask the bus boy for water multiple times or else we'd have eaten with nothing to drink. Food had some great flavors, but not for the price. Waitress also couldn't give me an accurate list of the whiskeys they had or a good description of the  wine selection. We won't be back. Save your time and money and go to Greek town.",

The decor here is warm and inviting and there is plenty of cozy seating if you want to sit against pillows and just relax. I would suggest coming here with a good friend and splitting all the tapas between the two of you so you can sample all the rich flavors. The food I ordered was fresh, authentic and healthy so this is not your \"generic\" Greek/American cuisine this is more traditional Greek food with full bodied flavors. I also really enjoyed the hot chai at the end of my meal and next time I will come here just to try some of their desserts.",
