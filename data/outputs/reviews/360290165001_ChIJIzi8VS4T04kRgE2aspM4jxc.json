        "caption": "Very friendly staff and fresh ingredients. Flavors just not there. The salted chips offer more flavor than any of their prepared food items. The buffalo chicken was extremely bland and tasted more like mayonnaise with a hint of blue cheese. No hot sauce or \"Buffalo\" flavor to be found really. Some salt, or marinating in apple cider vinegar, would've done great justice. The Jamaican Jerk is good, as the profile is there, but the flavors don't pop and aren't as intense as you would expect from any jerk dish. I also appreciate the diversity of ingredients to create complexity. The steak is the best so far. Flavorful and very tender. Could slightly benefit from more acidity such as marinating in a vinegar, but otherwise very good. The menu has potential. I think they're worth trying, and I would personally like to see improvements. Portions are great and make it worthwhile. Won't end lunch hungry.",

I haven't been for breakfast sandwiches yet, but I heard they are phenomenal, and I don't have a single doubt about it.
