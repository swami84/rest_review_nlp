I wouldn't say 1 star they are nice people. I wouldnt come back me personally. This is just my opinion and at the end I had to go up to the counter to ask for our cookie.

My friend had the Parisien eggs Benedict with a side of potatoes which she loved.

So they remade it which was nice until it came out just a touch warmer than the last time....how can poached eggs come out almost cold and the meat & sauce cold too.   Hope we don't get sick.

But if you didn't take the train, you can find (paid)parking on some of the side streets. Mon Ami is a very spacious, well lit restaurant, with a wonderful view of the neighborhood. There is plenty of table seating as well as bar stool seating at the windows.  Today's visit was for the breakfast sandwich (egg,cheese,meat). The croissant was very soft and flaky, and had a nice amount of egg and bacon. I would've enjoyed it a little bit more, if there was more cheese to it. The side of potatoes (spices,chop onions) was very good. They offer gourmet cookies and other pastries. All the prices are on par with other higher end restaurants. The quality of the food here is well worth it. The employees are great especially Claudia.",

I am not an easily impressed individual when it comes to food. I've traveled the world and have eaten some amazing foods in Italy and france. I ordered 5 macaroons (for $11.50 I think) which at 1st I thought was a.little pricey...until I tasted them. Before we left I ended up buying 5 more. We could nt get enough they were devine. Then we ordered the eggs Benedict  that comes on a croissant with thick cut bacon and thin sliced ham and choice of side fruit or potato. I am an egg Benedict SNOB I must confess. Like I said it's super hard to impress me. We were in heaven. We would've paid twice what the plate actually cost  (which was only $9.45 I think). I couldnt get enough. I was so happy I wanted to hug the chef. I tipped the young kid who took our order bc I was so happy and he was so chipper and helpful. The menu is smallish but that's a European thing...keep the menu small so you can make everything to perfection. And they did. I will be bringing everyone I know to breakfast, brunch and lunch here as often as I can afford. I'm their new biggest fan. And bc they haven't been open that long it's still a well kept secret so it wasn't busy at all. The food came out within 10 mins of us sitting down. I was in shock. #monami  #doingitright",

Plenty of seating around the location.  Staff was friendly and helpful, presentation of already prepared food was excellent.",
