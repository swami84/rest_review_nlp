She will make you feel cared for, respected & like family. NOT just like a customer picking up food. I am so thankful to have vegan food made by people from poor & working class communities like mine. I am even more thankful to support this business! Soon we will never have to go all the way to the bougie/gentrified parts of Manhattan/Brooklyn to pay for overpriced bird food in the name of health when we can have VEGAN SOUL healthy food in our own neighborhoods. Support these people because we need them to thrive!!!",

On top of that I really appreciated the excellent customer service, a lot of people nowadays take that for granted, but they really care at VeganHood and it shows.
