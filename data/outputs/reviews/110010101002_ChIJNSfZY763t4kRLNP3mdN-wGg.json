Valentine\u2019s Day dinner at Alhambra only offered a pre-set menu of $100 per person or $140 with wine, which wasn\u2019t worth it. Small sizes and taste was average. Regular menu was not an option that night.  The service was awful. Few servers for all tables, always saying Sorry for being behind, which made this pricey experience not our best choice. It took a long time for the server to come greet us, and show us the menu. Also, took a long time to pick up the plates between servings which was annoying. Pretty much the only thing that was done right away, was the check.",

The St. Regis hotel is beautiful and elegant...like many other places in DC, it is also a historical landmark.  The service is very friendly and attentive....though we also came early.  Our mimosas were bottomless and the hors d'oeuvres were tasty, but a few of the hot bar items were just lukewarm.  The cold bar was excellent....loved the oysters.  Then there was the entree....I ordered the lobster eggs benedict and my husband  ordered the lamb shank.  Both meals were so good.  Just be prepared for the large portions and try to save room for those delicous desserts!  :-)",

        "caption": "My wife and I treated ourselves to the Alhambra's luxurious Sunday jazz brunch. It was expensive, but well worth every penny. We had a fantastic time! The food, service, music and ambiance were all great. Everything is buffet style, except the main course which you order off the menu. We started with the raw bar, salad, cheese and charcuterie, along with bottomless mimosas. There is also a bottomless bloodymary option. We followed this with some small quiches and fruit salad, before our main course. For our entrees, I had a lobster benedict like dish and my wife had a fabulous chicken and waffles. We were stuffed after, but found a little more room to try some of the exquiset mini desserts. The jazz musicians were wonderful and the dining room was fairly intimate. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves immensely and we'll have to come back sometime to try their dinner service. We highly recommend this place for a celebratory brunch.",
