Their personable friendly staff who go exceptionally above and beyond to make sure your order is EXACTLY what you want and ordered. They are way above standards in hygiene, quality and preparation. Also using mandated guidelines to ensure safety and cleanliness to all who order from their establishment. I am a frequent customer and have never ever been disappointed or felt as though they neglected a direct standard health and hygiene procedure. I have with my own eyes seen their employees wear gloves. Handle all ingredients with uptmost care and use extreme caution when dealing with orders containing serious allergies.  I highly recommend stopping by and giving the Juice Box BK a shot you will without a doubt not be disappointed \ud83d\ude09",
