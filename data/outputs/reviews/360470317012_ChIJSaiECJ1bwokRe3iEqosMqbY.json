They had amazing specials and special appetizers on the sandwich board back when there was seating. We always get several of the appetizers on their regular menu: sticky wings, spring rolls, and ribs are some favorites. I can't recall an entree we didn't like but recent favorites are the Pad Gra Prow and Gang Dang (red curry). Oh and sometimes you get a sample size extra appetizer in your order!!",

Food is always prepared in a timely way, staff is very kind and welcoming, and you can't go wrong with the menu choices. My go-to are usually their green curry or pad king ruammit, but I've never been disappointed with any of the options. Not all neighborhood Thai places are created equal, but I'm happy to have this one nearby :)",

Most of the time it's Americanized and the heat is downplayed.  Well this place has a bit of both....Authentic Thai flavors and heat as well as some Americanized dishes (like pineapples in curry?) . I don't know, is that a thing in Thailand?  Maybe in certain regions?  But it was still tasty.  I always judge a Thai restaurant based on their soups and their Pad Kee Mao.  Food: - Chicken Satay - this dish was okay....I was a bit disappointed that chicken breast was used and not chicken thigh.  So I didn't care much for me, but my friend really enjoyed it.  - Tom Kha - This was one of the highlights of the meal.  The soup was so flavorful!  Almost like the one I had in Thailand!  Amazing!  Loved each sip of the soup soooo much. Definitely get this if you want soup.  - Pad Kee Mao - Another amazing highlight of the meal.  It had the wok char flavor in this dish that takes the dish to the next level.  The heat was perfect, but also a bit too spicy, but still it was so flavorful and exactly how Pad Kee Mao should taste.  yummmm.  - Panang Curry - This was a bit awkward....the curry had pineapples in it!  I know pineapple is used to sweeten dishes and tenderize meats, but cook it in curry?  I don't know how I feel about that.  Well the curry itself was still tasty, so no complaints there.  Definitely coming back here to try other dishes and get the same dishes I enjoyed.  Worth the trip to brooklyn to check this place out!  Yummmm!!",
