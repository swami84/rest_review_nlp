After eating there, it is obvious that this establishment solely draws its crowd from being located in Le Meridian in downtown Tampa. Come for the food, surely leave with disappointment.  Same feeling I get when I visit a strip club for their Sunday breakfast. Eggs Benedict with spinach and mushrooms w/ side of potatoes, will take you down the wonderful road of blandness. The only sensation my tastes buds had was from Very Berry Mojito, and that was very very bitter. Service well below average. Ordered my drink and some guy who came in 10 minutes after me ordered the same drink and received his before me. COOL!   I guess he maybe called it in?!???! Oh, and their outdoor seating shouldn't be even an option for reservations. It is literally 200 feet away from the restaurant and they do not offer table service.  That is like me saying the bus stop on the corner is outdoor seating for McDonalds. Anyways see you never again and best wishes in colored beige world.",

It was a very bad experience and because the management had no initiative to do anything about the loud and obnoxious shouting from the large party less than 25 feet from us I will not return.  My entire party of 10 were just miserable because of the noise.  It wasn't until we were about finished with our dinner did the management ask them to quiet down.  Then I was told that the hotel guest on the other side of the wall from the party had complained.

You just have to know where to look and if you happen to find yourself walking past a court building, you might want to do a double take because Bizou Brasserie restaurant could very well be located inside.  Bizou Brasserie is, in fact, part of the same building that houses the Le Meridien hotel and, yes, this was once a federal court building. The restaurant features a good deal of ambiance, comfortable seating, pillars, marble, and other features that produce and elegant look overall. However, if you\u2019re concerned that this dining establishment might be on the snooty side, don\u2019t worry- Bizou Brasserie isn\u2019t like that. It is still casual enough that you will feel comfortable.  Bizou Brasserie has six different menus: One for breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, Sunday brunch, and Bar & Small Plates. Many who visit here come for the bar and drinks, and it isn\u2019t difficult to see why. They serve specialty drinks, plus local beer and a vast selection of wine. The wine is easily visible in the main dining room, and that is because there is a full wall of wine in racks.  When I dined at Bizou Brasserie , it was for breakfast. I pondered over the menu for quite some time before finally choosing a ham and cheese omelet with potatoes, toast, orange juice, and coffee. I felt satisfied with the quality and found the amount of food just right. It was a great way to start my day and provide the fuel I needed before exploring the city. If you like coffee and want something delicious, I recommend indulging in one of the specialty coffees like the Salted Caramel Mocha Cappuccino and Peppermint Mocha Latte. They are certain to satisfy most any coffee lover who tries them.  Bizou Brasserie service is quite good with a wait staff that is attentive and accommodating. My overall experience at Bizou Brasserie was positive overall and I recommend at least stopping by and sitting at the bar for a quick drink and one of the small plates if you happen to be in the Tampa area.",

Our food took more than 50 mins to come out, and only after we asked for it. The server told us the food had taken so long because of the 1 other table that was being served (?). When the food came it was really disappointing. Some orders were wrong, some items were cold. Eventually we asked to speak with the manager, it even took us asking twice to actually get the manager to come to the table. The manager was nice when he came over to the table, although the server seemed totally oblivious to the fact that anything was wrong. The manager said he would provide a discount - after another 30 minutes the adjusted checks came. There was a $2 discount on our checks but a 20% service charge was still included (more than $3). We explained that we didn't want to pay the 20% service charge after the experience. They took the checks back to adjust them again but then another server had to come by to ask each of us what we had ordered. Eventually they took the service charge off and added a 20% discount. Overall - disaster from start to finish for what should have been a really simple meal.   Definitely will not be back.",

My only complaint is that when we got there and ordered our drinks, I had told our waiter that I was between 2 cocktails. I chose 1, and told him, I'd switch it up to the other drink after I had the 1st. He never checked back on us. It also would have been nice to be offered a coffee while we had dessert. I loved all the food, and it was nice to dine in a beautiful place like this, and I loved how it wasn't crowded. They don't pack people in, and have them sit so close to others. Very enjoyable.",

I also had the peppered beef tenderloin skewers. They were hardly peppered and the sauces that came with them were mediocre at best. The chocolate torte desert was really good though. Maybe I got the wrong food. The company I was with enjoyed her flatbread and house Caesar salad though (which had fresh anchovies in it).

After being seated it took 20 minutes for our server to greet us. The food was average, nothing amazing which would offset the poor service time. Will not be back.",

We started with drinks that took almost 30 minutes to get to us.  We had the cheese and charcuterie plate as an appetizer.  The Genoa salami and chorizo were no better than you buy at a grocery store, same with the cheese.  We had burgers which were actually outstanding! Good balance of meats and flavors and cooked perfectly.  My wife and I opted for side salads as a sides.  The lettuce greens were crisp and fresh but the salad dressings were both watered down and lacked any flavor. I had blue cheese and she had ranch. The desserts were good and the coffee was very tasty.  For the money I would have expected better.  Our waiter was adequate but did not make us feel special. I've had wait staff at the Waffle House who made me feel more important.",

My fiance got the lobster ravioli, which was decent, but very heavy on the spiciness. He also tried the Filthy Devil which came out muddy looking, and the Chili Bloody Mary, which was very heat forward with no taste. It was disappointing because he loves spicy food, but not just for the sake of it being hot. I got the Bumble Berry Sangria which is best described as tasting \"pink\". The Mezcal Matador just tasted like tequila. Service was sloppy and mixed up two of our orders (Irish coffee became coffee and herbed mashed potatoes became wild mushroom medley). Our server snatched a menu out of my hand to check what an item was called and talked with us at length about his family. We don't mind having some side conversation, but not for that long, and not about a server's personal life.  tldr: This place looks great, but is not worth the price they're charging for bland food and mediocre, clumsy service. Tidy up the service, balance the menu with decent flavors and cocktails, or lower the prices to reflect what's going on.",

I've come for brunch in the past, had drinks and apps at the bar on a Friday night and the service is always good.  I have a very specific bone to pick with them though...the foods sometimes trendy to a fault. Each time I've gone to brunch, everyone had questions about the menu. I love french toast, they had stuffed french toast. I like bacon, theirs is candied. I like tomatoes, they have tomato jam. It's almost comical- but honestly I do find something I enjoy everytime I go, but it's like those niche and trendy items are to justify the prices that accompany a restaurant being in a hotel in downtown.  I like that they take risks with the menu and I always find something I enjoy eating.  Each time I've gone, it hasn't been busy, but they act like it is. \ud83d\ude02  The last time I went, I ordered french toast and it was burnt. They still get 4 stars because I was with a group and everything else for everyone else came out good, but I was a little peeved because I ordered my food after everyone else had ordered so it wasn't part of a large order and the restaurant was clearing out from after brunch, so it didn't make sense why my food would come out burnt. It looked burnt, the first bite, I couldn't taste the char, but after I got through the first half slice all I tasted was burnt food.  If this was my first visit, I would have given 3 stars. Burnt food should not make it to the table under any circumstances.  Neil and Cody are both great servers and great sports for my group.  Pro-tip: If you get your parking validated at the restaurant, it only costs $5 and they have umbrellas when it's raining.",

For dinner, we split pork with frites, and our server, Ryan, presented it to us on two different plates without us having to ask. The pork was well seasoned and moist, the fries, cooked in truffle oil, were crisp and delicious. It was served with a small salad on the side. I really liked the vinaigrette dressing. Then, after we mentioned it was my birthday, I received a free creme brulee cheesecake. The pricing is exactly what you'd expect for a high-end, classy restaurant. Not at all unreasonable!

The Longitude Bar\u2019s lavished cocktails are a great temptation. No, the prices are not cheap, but the experience of the place makes them worthwhile. Try the Vieux Carre. Not a Shirley Temple. A concoction of rye whiskey and Benedictine that smells better than some, rather expensive perfumes, you have given an ex for Valentine\u2019s in a failed attempt to get them back. A drink to be savored slowly unless your intentions are to end up dancing on tables by the end of the night. The \u201cNot your Father\u2019s Old Fashioned\u201d is good, but actually might just be a left over from one of your father\u2019s because, although quite nice, is not creatively fabulous. However, you can never go wrong with an Old Fashioned. If you are into girlie (I can foresee the avalanche of hate mail from feminist here, even when I am one myself) drinks or fruity drinks, you might enjoy the Bizou Bramble. A lovely cocktail of Flor de Ca\u00f1a rum, blackberry infused syrup and lemon. Personally, it would take me about ten of those to get my booze on, and by then, I most likely be washing dishes in the kitchen to pay for the bill\u2026 but if you don\u2019t want to scare your first date, you might just order one because it is classy and unalcoholic like. Bizou Brasserie, the restaurant, redefines fabulous. I have taken pictures of the place and believe it haunted. The photos, even when unedited, always come out in sepia. Some trick of the lighting and the marble on the walls\u2026 pure magic. Bizou cooks the best duck in Tampa, in my very humble and gastronomically uneducated opinion. When I don\u2019t ask for it, I harass someone else in the table to order it and then pout and annoy him or her into sharing it with me. The duck is pan seared and served with the celery root puree (but I always trade it for the cauliflower hash) and a citrus sauce. My favorite part are also the beluga lentils they garnish the plate with. More please. I have tasted the Pancetta Wrapped Monkfish and it was good. Not great because I learned to eat monkfish in Oviedo and the freshness and saltiness is completely different. The fish is quite savory nevertheless. If you choose to wander into the adventure of monkfish and you just don\u2019t know what it looks like or you no longer remember\u2026 do yourself a favor and do not google pictures. Don\u2019t be judgmental. Think of other unpleasantly looking things that are edible and enjoyable. As appetizers, Bizou serves an amazing beef tartare. They use filet mignon, capers, cornichons (baby pickles), artichokes and an alioli. The deviled eggs are also a treat. They are filled with crab meat and portioned to share. The escargots are cooked inside a puff pastry. A great way to try them if you have been afraid of ordering them otherwise. The building exudes elegance and refinement and the dishes and libations complement it. If it is a bit expensive to binge at, it is still a wonderful place to sit and sip coffee at. It is after all an old court house remodeled. One of the few times in which you can celebrate the feared: \u201cyou have officially been served.\u201d",

        "caption": "Located in an old remolded federal courthouse this restaurant has much style and a nice trendy atmosphere with high ceilings and grand open spaces.  It's in the La Meridian Hotel that recently opened (2014).  Once climbing the high staircase you first enter the the bar area that has nice a large social area and good bar top seating.  The restaurant is located toward the back.  We came for lunch and were seated promptly.  The lunch menu has an excellent variety of salads, hot sandwiches, flat-breads and appetizers.  We started off with the calamari that was excellent!  Cooked to perfection, very tender with amble coating.  The portion was a bit on the small side and was barley enough for two any more people sharing and it would have been a morsel.  For the main entree I ordered the Bizou Burger with a side salad.  I ordered it medium and it came out more on the well side and a bit dry.  Hard to grab the flavor profiles because it was a bit dry.  Basically tasted like any other burger but very expensive at $17.00.  That's a bit high for lunch.  You have to consider where you are at though.  My wife ordered the Salade Frisee with chicken ($19.00!!!).  She siad it was good but at the cost and portion size it was not worth it at all.  Really, a $20.00 dollar chicken salad.",
