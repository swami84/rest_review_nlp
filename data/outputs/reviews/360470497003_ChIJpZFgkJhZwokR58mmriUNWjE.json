I had to leave my coat \ud83e\udde5 on since it was not warm  I had the kimchi fried rice but to my surprise it was of wet texture and somewhat sweet. The pork bits that were mixed in didn't taste flavorful The rock shrimp are baby size deep fried \ud83c\udf64 covered in a mayo sauce. I suggest you ask for the sauce on the side. The shrimp shumai was good. The fried chicken was exceptional. My past experiences with Korean fried chicken \ud83c\udf57 was the inside not being properly cooked. Chingoo DOES NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE. Also the chicken is not smothered in sauce My friend had the bimbimbap- lunch special- which she enjoyed",
