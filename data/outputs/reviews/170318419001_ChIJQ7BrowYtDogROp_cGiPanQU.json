Also very important, please order one of the Tymbark Fruit Juices, they pair wonderfully with vodka or  tequila! We will definitely be coming back here in the future.  Note: Due to the pandemic, POLOMBIA is currently partnering with a restaurant called the Outpost Mexican Eatery to serve customers on weekends through a \"pop-up\" arrangement. You will pick up your food at the exit door of the Outpost or you can call for curbside pick-up. The staff is SUPER friendly.",

They also threw in 3 of their little kolaczki desserts which was super nice. Bonus points for compostable takeout containers, a paper bag, and not giving us utensils/napkins as requested!

The restaurant is located within the Politan Row chef-driven food hall. The high quality of food being served at Polombia, the presentation of the food, the thought itself of mixing Polish dishes with Colombian accents and Colombian dishes with Polish accents is an one brilliant idea (two countries in two different parts of the world, yet this fusion matches perfectly). Add a great staff members to all this and you got yourself an overall wonderful restaurant experience. There are 5 main dishes on the menu, some sides and desserts to go along and thanks to that you get to explore the passion-driven food, neatly prepared by the chef (so far my favorite is the Mojo Roasted Chicken Arepa-ski, which you have to try yourself). Even the selection of beverages  available there will let you taste either of the two countries. To sum it all, I have three adjectives to describe this restaurant: CREATIVE, INNOVATIVE, INDIVIDUAL because you will not find anything like that elsewhere, at least in Chicagoland area. Anyone that tries food from Polombia will not be disappointed! I, for sure, will be back there soon again to try some more.",
