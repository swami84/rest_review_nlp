I would not order from this restaurant again if you paid me. There are plenty of good Chinese take-out places, and just as many good Tex-Mex take-out places in Brooklyn. This is not one of them. This is the worst in both fields. The Chinese food was as bland as could be, and the Mexican food was just disgusting.
