The young lady, who almost always takes the orders and is the cashier, understands and speaks english. She is fast, friendly, and efficient. She took my phone order today, but must have stepped out when I went to pick up my order. Three older workers, who couldnt understand me, yelled and tried yo charge me an extra $1.25 for extra rice when i didnt order it. I tried to explain that to them in plain english, but all three started yelling and insisted i ordered it. Luckily, the younger lady came back and knew exactly what i ordered. All the older workers walked away, one angrily gave me my order, and never apologized. I wont patronize them for awhile and will be sure to share my experience with others.",
