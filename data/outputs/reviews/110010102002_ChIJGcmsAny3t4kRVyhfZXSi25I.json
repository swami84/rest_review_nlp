The bread was fresh and had great texture and flavor, they were very generous with their meats, and the meatballs and marinara were flavorful and juicy. I try to come in with no expectations for hoagie shops to have an objective opinion, but found that here it wasn't necessary. If you are looking for a good Italian hoagie or meatball marinara sub, definitely come here. We will be back to try the roast pork. Update, ordered the cheese steak, and it was delicious. Good amount of meat and cheese, along with onions and my choice mushrooms.",

Their risotto balls are killer! The sandwiches are hit or miss. The minelli sandwich is tasty, but the retzo was too much. The breaded chicken is deep-fried too much that it can give you heartburn as you eat it. Also, the sandwiches come on hard bread.  If you want the best sandwiches in D.C., go to one of these delis- 1) Mangialardo's on Capitol Hill, 2) Carl's Subbs in Woodridge, 3) Mother Rucker's north of H Street NE, 3) Bub and Pop's in Dupont Circle, or 4) MLK Deli in Congress Heights.",

It also suffers a bit for the high price point, but given the location and quality of the sandwich, this is to be expected. Overall, a great sandwich shop worth visiting.",

The guy walking around said the machine broke that morning, but said he would give me a refund or do whatever I wanted. The line was long and they were getting busy.  I decided to just drink room temperature soda. Since they already knew that, it would have been much better if the person behind the register told the customer they had no ice. He seemed to be struggling enough as it was with just taking the orders. The sandwich was good sized. We should have just shared the sandwich.  My friend took half of her's home.  The sandwich was really salty though. I had to drink water all afternoon. Don't plan to go back.",

It's only quality ingredients and IG worthy decor here. Definitely check out the neon signs, wall graffiti and layout of the menus. We had the 9th, Minellii, Philly special and Forager. The Philly special is a must if you love cheesesteaks! The Minelli is packed with all types of meat and the veggies stuffed inside are delicious. The addition of the spicy aioli adds a bit of a kick.  I really enjoyed the food and service here. We had a fairly large order right when the doors opened. The staff and manager were great at accommodating us. Everything was really fresh and you can tell they take time with each sub. The baguettes themselves were great in texture. Tough and crunchy on the outside. Really soft and warm on the inside. Prices are reasonable considering its the Wharf. Highly recommend checking out the menu prior to stepping in or order ahead. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other vegetarian subs.",
