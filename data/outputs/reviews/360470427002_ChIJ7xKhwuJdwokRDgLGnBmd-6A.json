Very dishonest restaurant and delivery.  The only thing they ever said is that we ordered too close to closing.  How is that possible when we called two hours later and they were still open?  If they couldn't take our order, they should have never accepted the order, or after they did accept the order have called and told us they would not be able to fulfill it and NOT charge our credit card. It seems a bit dishonest and shady, and then refuse to speak when we called after waiting two hours for a delivery that never came.  Would never order from this place again.",
