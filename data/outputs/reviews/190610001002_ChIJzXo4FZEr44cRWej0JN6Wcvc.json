Staff was very friendly but they were non existent. They were not very busy and we waited for at least 10 minutes before someone even came over to seat us. Once seated it was another 10 minutes before our waitress came over. I was watching the whole time as I\u2019m a people watcher. All the waitresses seemed to be in the kitchen 90%of the time. Unless they are having them cook I don\u2019t understand. We watched other people come in and not be acknowledged and wait for 15 minutes and left. Then when they were seated it took forever for them to get serviced. You could see the frustration. They seemed to be decently staffed but they need to figure out why they are in the kitchen all the time. We had to ask the girl that was clearing tables to get our check. She got it and I was surprised our waitress didn\u2019t bring it out. Again they were nit that busy. I appreciated that she brought it so fast and gave her $5 for her help. Our waitress finally came out as we were leaving and said Thank You. We really enjoyed our visit but thinking we will skip Caroline\u2019s.",

We were very excited to come here for date night, as we noticed this restaurant right after we moved to Dubuque and we're very excited to have a nice night out. However, our service was very slow, and we felt as though our server was rude towards our feelings, questions and requests that we made. We felt as though we became an afterthought to our server after it took about 15 minutes for her to come back after we said we needed a little more time to look at the menu and took her quite some time after the food came to check on how it was. I loved my dinner and had originally wanted to substitute something else for asparagus as I do not like it, the waitress said we do not do salads after I asked if I could substitute for a side salad, and she said \" I'm not quite sure what you are asking\" , and looked at me with a blank stare. My wife and I have been in the service industry for quite a long time and we've never been treated that way as a customer, and would never treat one of our customers the way my wife and I were treated this evening. Instead of doing everything that could have been done to help us feel better and make us happy, we felt like we were being brushed off and we just wanted to leave as soon as possible. My wife ordered the special for the evening and it turned out to be what felt like an entire box of pasta drenched in olive oil with a few tomatoes, olives, overcooked shrimp and feta cheese sprinkled on top... We do not feel like a bowl of pasta salad that has been warmed up should not be $22. Overall we were incredibly disappointed and upset with how our nice date night came to fruition. What we thought was going to be a new place for us to go for special occasions and night out with friends will now be on our list of places we will not go and will tell people we had a bad experience.",

My meal was really bad- I got \"half a chicken\" and it wasn't even a 1/4th. I got 3 dinky pieces and they weren't even that well done, but I had nobody to turn too because our waitress was now up a floor doing God know's what. When we finally got our bill we waited for her and nothing. so I've finally had enough to went to the bar to pay.Of course one girl was lolling around, the other went to take care of it and five minutes later comes back to tell us \"You're waitress will be taking care of it in a minute\".

Breakfast time was very busy but we didn't wait long at all for our food.

Has a omelet station with standard selections and they deliver to your table when ready... Maybe... Service was awful. Waited 10 minutes after being seated for anyone to notice we were there.  Heard the servers arguing about who should assist our table... Then neither one did.  Finally one of the hostesses asked if we wanted to order food...duh it's a restaurant... Half of the Table of 8 next to us didn't get their food for over 30 minutes.  It looked like the server that came to our table only had that table and ours, but had a very difficult time keeping up.  So many choices to stop for breakfast. Will not be stopping here again.",

Overall terrible service with a server who couldn't answer any questions about the food, we heard the next table from ours complain about the same thing to the manager, who then purposely avoided coming to our table (she rushed by and in passing asked if everything was ok. \"Good? Good.\")  And then the food - horrible for the price. We were expecting a great meal based on the descriptions and expense. I've never had such dry, tasteless pork. (Although my friends prime rib was not bad). Had the manager stopped by I would have sent my food back for the first time ever. As it was we were sick of waiting for the server to check on us and just wanted to get out of there. Went elsewhere for dessert because I was still hungry! Won't be going back, obviously.",

When asked the waitress said broccolini is broccoli with the stem still attached and is more bitter than broccoli. Gee, who could resist such a delicacy as bitter broccoli. We then asked about substituting a different vegetable that was at the same price as the broccolini and were told there would be an \"up-charge\" of the full price of another side to substitute. The waitress was asked about substituting french fries for the smashed potatoes and you guessed it, there would be an up-charge for that.  We were there for 2.5 hrs, had a meal of mediocre steaks, broccolini that none of us wanted or ate and extremely slow service. There are many places in Dubuque that will give you better service, better choices on their menu and better prices for similar meals.",
