It's offered like a plate lunch but instead of rice and mac salad, you can get rice and green salad (a better choice). The mini size is just the right portion for lunch. The price is less than $7. There's a lot of choices for places to eat in the Fort Street Mall but this is a nice hidden gem. Literally a mom and pop operation.",
