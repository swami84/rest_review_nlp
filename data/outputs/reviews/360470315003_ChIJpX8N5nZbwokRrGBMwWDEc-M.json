First off, I love local spots and I want them to work. New spots with new chefs are amazing, but the understanding has to be clear about the value proposition that makes a good experience. Here are the keys.  -service -portion to value understanding -neighborhood context for price and customer - flavor, taste, menu, etc  My friend and I looked on the menu for some options. It was lunch so we figured tacos would be good, and also judging by the waiters suggestion ordered 4.  When they arrived I was greeted by the smallest taco I have ever seen. And, I lived in SoCal, where the tacos are plentiful. Now, if it was $2, or 2.50 cool, but these mini bites masquerading as tacos were $5-7. Mind you they were good, but the portion was inadequate for the price. We\u2019re in crown heights people, not TriBeCa. Needless to say, all the food was at least 30-40% more expensive than it should be and 30-40% smaller than it should be.  I give three stars, because the taste was good, but sadly the price and portion are the key adequate reasons that make us go back and become a regular patron.  Side notes, the service was fine, but nothing notable. The chef was not relational, but perhaps it was an off day.  The Closing statement is this:  Understand your clientele and also the value proposition that makes a restaurant powerful where it is positioned. Get better La Napa, I want to come back. ;)",
