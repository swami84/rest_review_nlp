This is delicious and moist with fresh veggies and yummy soft gyro wrap.  The staff is incredibly warm and gracious. I would have these folks cater a work lunch or family event.  I fear that they won't survive the misery of this pandemic year.",

Don't let the size or location of this place deture you from giving this place a try. It smelled soon good when I entered. Very clean and welcoming.I wanted a grinder but decided on the fried chicken and jojos because I've been craving fried chicken but wanted homemade not fast food style. I was not disappointed. Really crunchy crust and deliciously juicy meat. My boyfriend also ordered a steak and cheese grinder. We had to share!!! It smelled and looked to good not to try a bite.(I ate half\ud83d\ude0b) BEST STEAK & CHEESE EVER!!! Family owned and run. You can taste the love in their food...homemade goodness. The complementary black tea with mint was refreshing. I will be revisiting. Thanks for a great lunch",
