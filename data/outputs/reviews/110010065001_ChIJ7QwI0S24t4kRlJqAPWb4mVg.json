Their menu is extensive and full of what you expect from a proper sushi bar.  The service was enthusiastically friendly and helpful. Whoever was at the door deserves a raise.  The sushi is *excellent* and I cannot stress that enough. Flavorful, well made, and proper proportions. I splurged on the O'o Toro sushi and was not disappointed.  Highly recommend.

Always had omakase sushi and this time the fish assortment was cheap and the quality of the fish, esp tuna belly (otoro) and salmon, were bad (hard to chew as opposed to soft and melt to mouth as normally are). And no liquor served (or allowed to bring byob) as they said haven\u2019t renewed liquor license, which was not disclosed at the time of me making a dinner reservation over the phone. And the manager didn\u2019t give an apology for that. We saw a group of ppl were leaving after finding out they don\u2019t serve alcoholic beverages. The waiting staff confirmed with us that they were separated from the sister restaurant sushi ogawa about 6 months ago and the management has been changed, and that probably the reason why the restaurant is going downhill.",

Sushi Capitol is an intimate venue with only a few tables which means you get excellent service. Plates are cleared as soon as you finish, you're never looking around for service as the soon as you look up with eye content they are at your table. While a quite venue and a great walkable location from the Metro or capitol area it does not have any outdoor seating like the location nearby. The sushi is spectacular and the use of real wasabi ground from the root has this place standing a head above other sushi spots in DC. The price is worth it if you appreciate high quality food and great service.",

It was a quick in and out process as traditional sushi counters are. The fish served for the omakase was very standard. Having heard Sushi Capitol being dubbed \"Best sushi in DC\" I expected more extravagant offerings. Also, the manner in which the chef handled the fish was not delicate, as it usually is.

Small space, not cute or pretty or trendy just tables, chairs and some seats at the sushi bar. Because it is popular calling ahead and making a reservation is highly recommended. Going in blind my date and I ordered off the sushi menu which was a mistake since we quickly realized everyone else was doing the Chef's Tasting, which for $50 bucks you get a few courses of dishes including sushi you can't order off the menu. While everything we ordered was delicious, we missed out because the sushi going out for the tastings looked amazing. Oh well, now we know what to do the next time we go, and we will be going again!",

We walked in and the restaurant is pretty small and narrow with only a few tables but the place can turn out some regulars so you know it is good. The sushi was great! Perfectly put together and some of the best in DC that I've had. The service was great and fast. We'll be back for sure!",

The fish is always fresh from the regular salmon, yellowtail, toro to specials of the night like live scallop, uni, giant clam, eel and etc. The chef and manager always took the time to explain about the specials and what's in season. I had different uni every time I visited, from the east coast, Japan and California. During my last visit, as I noticed the difference in taste, the chef explained that it is difficult to get quality uni from Japan in the summer but  they should return in early fall. This is not a place to get those crazy rolls drenched in crunchy flakes and mayos typically seen at most Japanese restaurants in the area. It's one of the few authentic sushi restaurants and is a true gem. $50 for omakase is a great deal and you will not be disappointed.",
