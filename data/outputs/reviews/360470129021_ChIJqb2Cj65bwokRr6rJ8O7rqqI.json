The only reason I gave two stars is because I\u2019m understanding of what restaurants are going through in these times. But seasoning food and food quality should not suffer.

I asked for a pricey Salmone Alla Griglia, $27.50 with Saut\u00e9ed Broccoli Rabe which was mixed with Kale. I asked to be cooked medium well. I got a well done salmon, that wasn't fresh. It was on a bed of Kale steams with some hitch of Broccoli. The worst part, beside as I mentioned it wasn't fresh an it was pricey, not only the Kale and Broccoli was salty, but the salmon itself was so salty that couldn't eat it. I told to the waitress about the problem and she said that maybe it was the Broccoli and Kale. She didn't offer me any other suggestion or tried to fix the food, nothing she left. I called her back and I asked her to take the food and bring me the check, which she did and I left. No a word like I am sorry or something else. It was as bad as I am describing it. It was a shame since I was walking for a.long time around 5th Av in Brooklyn looking for a restaurant that I like it but...",

I ordered the spicy salami and added mushrooms.  The salami did NOT taste fresh,  i ended up picking all of the salami off because it was clearly expired. The tomato sauce was very bland, and the crust was rubbery... despite the fact. The mushrooms were decent though undercooked.   If your having a hankering for Pizza in Bedstuy I highly recommend  Daddy Greens, or Pizza Party and though over priced Artichoke is always consistent.   Sadly this place was a complete waste of my cheat day.  \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

The restaurant has a split opening so I went into the section that had the bar. I was greeted by one of the waitresses and asked if I can sit anywhere, since I was dining alone . I started off with cappuccino and ordered Spinach fettecini in lemon sauce topped with pistachio and shrimp (I added parmesan cheese). It was my first time eating a dish containing pistachio so I was quickly awaken by the pungent aroma.  The lemon sauce added acidicity to taste . Shrimp tasted fresh yet not overly cooked.  Overall I wouldn't order this particular dish again  but I did appreciate the service. 3 stars for presentation of food and 4 stars for service. My waitress was attentive but not overbearing. Also when closing out your meal they deliver the receipt in an Italian comic book. I thought that was original. Grazti!",

I\u2019ve been ordering through Postmates while working late nights and the products delivered were not good. More specifically last night the pizza was below average, the dough was rubbery and I added extra cherry tomatoes and they put two halves (literally, but I mean, that\u2019s and upgrade considering last time they forgot them to begin with).  I mean, I try not to be a super picky Italian but for a $22 pizza I expect way more than this.",

The location, atmosphere, size of the space, bathroom, food, service, price considering all things, etc. Broccolino gets 3 stars based on the fact that it is not that cheap and the place is super small, tables are shared and the pizza comes from the next door where they have another spot. That was weird, seeing the waiter walking outside with hot food from our place to the next door place where they had customers seating. In other words, if you order pizza it comes from next door, if you seat next door and ask for food other than pizza the food will inevitably go through the sidewalk. Weird! Is that even legal?

The burrata prosciutto was tasty with very fresh and creamy burrata. The pastas are great: highly recommend the gnocchi. It has a texture of mochi which mash really well with  the creamy sauce and the savory ham. The black linguine is firm and chewy, also pairs well with the thick and flavorful tomato sauce. The lobster was okay. Overall pretty good place and would definitely go back for the pastas (especially that gnocchi) in the future.",

My sister had the lasagna and she finished before any of us! We all loved our food.  Third, scenery.  The vibe was cozy! They had a little brighter than dim lighting, and it was comfy lighting. The music and the smell was mesmerizing.  Lastly, cheque.  10/10: the food was worth the price, also, the cheque came in an old Italian book! I\u2019ve never seen something like that before. It was creative.  The only problem is that the restaurant is a bit small. It was packed, so, it was tiny.  IF they made it bigger, the restaurant would be perfect!",

        "caption": "After looking for a place to eat a little later on in the evening my friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant and while it was completely empty, it seemed promising so we grabbed a sidewalk seat and decided to give it a try.  Considering that we were the only two patrons in the restaurant, the service was trash. We were handed menus and our order was taken, once the food was brought out, neither of the two people working the front came back to our table until it was time for the check.  I know in NYC most Italian restaurants won't bring you bread (usually you have to buy it as an app) but at a place like this, I kind of assumed they would bring at a minimum a few slices. Nothing. When our food came out, the waiter who I think was the owner? just plopped our food down and didn't offer any sort of cheeses or anything. Even though we were the only patrons in the restaurant, I couldn't help but feel rushed the whole meal.  The food itself was such a disappointment. $18 for a lasagna slice? That's steep. BUT this portion size was accommodating to the cost. HOWEVER, it was some of the worst lasagna I've ever eaten. It was so salty after maybe 5 bites I forced myself to eat it because I was so hungry. luckily I had a bottle of water with me so with every bite, I'd also just down a gulp of water to offset the taste. My friends meal was no better. It was extremely saucy with not much flavor except for tons of salt as well.  At the conclusion of our meal, they didn't' ask us if we were ready for the check, they just came over to our table with check in hand when our plates were almost empty.  Maybe we should've taken the empty restaurant during prime eating hours as a sign that we shouldn't have eaten there. I learned my lesson and won't go back.",

The pizza came partially folded from the delivery guy and was cold. Perhaps not their fault, just be careful if you are ordering delivery. Also, I ordered extra mozzarella on my pizza and the cheese on my pizza is very scant. I can't imagine what it would look like without extra cheese.  Much of this I could excuse if this pizza tasted amazing. Unfortunately, it is waaaaay to salty. I'm not a picky eater but I've had this problem with other dishes here in the past.

        "caption": "While Broccolino has a lot of potential, in my opinion, they fall just a little too short. The staff is pretty friendly, although they tend to get frazzled when it's busy (and because the place is so small, they are \"busy\" often). Seating is a little cramped, but that is to be expected at a place so small. And it would be forgivable if we were talking about blow-you-away-just-as-good-as-Italy-Italian-food. But...  We're not. For a place like Broccolino which basically specializes in pasta, the standard should be how good the pasta is, and here, although it is homemade, this is where they fall short. The pasta is very frequently overdone and somewhat mushy. Which is a shame, because most other things are right on. Their chicken liver crostini is excellent. And the prosecco on tap is nice and affordable, albiet not amazing. Additionally, while there is nothing wrong with their basic marinara sauce that they use as the base for most of their tomato dishes, it's not great either. It tastes like they took it right from a can, added a touch of salt and pepper, and then called it a day.  That said, the last time I was here I had the gnocchi with mozzarella and, aside from the relatively plan and uninspired basic tomato sauce, the meal was pretty good. The gnocchi were actually very well done in this dish - nice and soft and pillowy, with bits of gooey mozzarella throughout the dish. Had they added a bit more basil, this would have been a standout dish.  So my advice is - if you walk by Broccolino and it's not packed, go in and enjoy a quick meal. But if it is at capacity and there's a wait, go around the corner, down 5th ave, and pick something else.",

        "caption": "Broccolino is a cute Italian restaurant within striking distance of the Barclays Center.  It's very small but they open up the storefront with tables on the sidewalk which allows for more seating.  It's owned by Italians (from Italy) which is a double edged sword; it makes the places feel more authentic if that matters to you, but the service is more like it is in Italy (AKA slow).  Getting their attention can be difficult, especially considering there are only 2-3 servers and they've wearing multiple hats, taking orders, resetting tables, bussing tables, etc.  Still the place has a pretty big menu for both drinks and food, and the decor/atmosphere is pretty ideal for a date spot.  The drinks here are very good, namely their 2 negronis (all I've had personally).  The difference between the 2 is one is traditional (gin, campari, sweet vermouth) and the other is their take on it (campari, prosecco, cinzano rosso).  If you want something lighter/less alcoholic, go with the latter.  Or better yet just go with any of the wines they have on tap; they also have a few beers and other cocktails available as well.  The food is good, but not great.  For appetizers, the eggplant parm is good but it's a tiny portion.  The fried calamari was decent as well, a little too heavy batter though.  Most pastas are made fresh in house which is a nice touch even though it's not the best fresh pasta in the world.  Skip the pappardelle with duck ragu, which wasn't nearly flavorful enough.  The spaghetti with white clam sauce is pretty good though.  Depending on what the gnocchi/ravioli of the day are, those can be good options.  Overall you don't really come here for the food though; you come for a date or a quick meal before heading to the Barclay's Center.",
