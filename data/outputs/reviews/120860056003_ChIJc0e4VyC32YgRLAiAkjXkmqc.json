Waiter we had was top notch. Tried the steak, lamp chop and salmon; all were some of the best I've ever had. Probably the best part was the piano player that night! He played renditions of popular songs that you would hear on the radio such as Justin Timberlake and Ariana Grande",

I love how they cook it first, bring it out, then take it to the back to cut it for us. It was perfectly cut. They also gave us the duck fat fries on the house. It is seasoned with three different seasonings and comes with three different sauces. It went very well with the meal. After the meal we had a banana tart that was delicious. I do not like overly sweet desserts so this was perfect!! Our server was also very wonderful and helpful. I dont remember his name but next time I go I will definitely request him...think it was JP or JB....",
