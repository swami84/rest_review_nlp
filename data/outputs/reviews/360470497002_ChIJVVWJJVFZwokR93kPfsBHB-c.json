All three share the fish broth, the picked vegetables, six sushi pieces of the same fish and two pieces of what is essentially nigiri. The $35 option gets additional hand rolls and the $45 option gets additional hand rolls and sashimi. I had the $45 set but I think the real value is in getting the $25 option as I didn't find the hand rolls or the sashimi that compelling. The highlights of the meal are the \"nigiri\" and the broth; the sushi is decent but it leaves you ultimately wondering whether you'd rather not eat different types of fish rather than eat the same one seasoned differently.",

The menu is creative (you choose only the portion, so kinda Omakase style). The blue-cheese sushi was mind blowing - that was my favorite that we ordered a special second portion just with that.  The restaurant is small and minimal; it's really cute and has a peaceful vibe.  If you have been to Okonomi or bought fish from Osakana, you might expected a sushi restaurant to come next from the owner. This place was begging to exist, now it's here. Good job.",
