She was delightful and very attentive. They allow you to bring your own wine for a corkage fee. We brought a bottle of '06 Barolo and it turned out that is the region of Italy she is from!  I ordered the Tonno to start, and my partner had the mushroom/snails dish. I enjoyed both but the Tonno was exceptional!  For the main course I had the lamb ragu, and my partner had the filet. The filet had a fantastic char on the outside but was still perfectly medium-rare inside, and the lamb ragu was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever.  I had the hazelnut/chocolate dessert and my partner had tiramisu. The tiramisu was good but go for the hazelnut!!! It was cold, creamy and delightful.",

We were shoved between two other tables of unhappy diners who should have given us a hint to leave. Service was terrible, our server barely spoke to us. All of this would have been fine if the food was good but it was the worst part. Braised beef ravioli was bland (like eating potroast stuffed into pasta in a watery broth). The braised lamb was gamy and not flavorful. For around $30 a dish, you\u2019d expect better. They are tryin (and failing) to be fine dining when they should just accept the reality of their sub-par dishes and adjust their prices accordingly. Do not go here.",

It was perfectly cooked and tasted so good. It was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture but I wasn't sure that was appropriate in a fancy restaurant.  I had Mousse all'Uva Fragola for dessert.

        "caption": "I went to Tosca last night as part of DC Restaurant Week and was very disappointed with my experience. To be fair, I had high expectations after reading reviews praising Tosca as an Italian fine dining experience. I understand that the purpose of DCRW is to make the fine dining experience more financially accessible, but it should not be a watered down version of the fine dining experience.  The waiter serving our group was rude. He spoke with a cadence and inflection that made it appear as though he was in a rush. He was very blunt when taking our order and made me feel unwelcome. He took the order of the some men at the table before taking the order of all the women and we were a table of 4. The server also abandoned our table at the end of the meal when a larger group was seated in his section. Another server, who had not severed us at any point during our meal, brought our check.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed by the food. I ordered the pappardelle, the pork loin, and the boccone. The DCRW menu lists the regular prices of these dishes in case someone wants to order them a-la-carte. The pork loin was listed as a $40 entree and I was served 4 slices of pork loin that had the length, width, and thickness of bacon with a teaspoonful of cannellini beans (literally 8-10 beans). If I was served that dish for $40, I would stand up and leave. I do not expect to leave a fine dining experience feeling full, but I expect to leave feeling satisfied at least, which I was not.  My experience at Tosca left a lot to be desired. Maybe it was a busy night, maybe they were running low on the pork loin in the kitchen and were rationing it, maybe I ordered the wrong dishes to get the full experience of the menu. Regardless, there should be no excuse for such a deterioration in quality at a fine dining establishment.",

The flavor was good, but certainly not the best I have ever had. Then I had the tiramisu, which was more liquid than other places. It's an interesting dish, but the taste was again just ok.

There a few details that could elevate the experience such as the plates for the water bottle and not serving the side dishes in a deep sauce pan. The ambiance is ok and the service from our waiter was excellent, however one of the water boys was rude and ruined the experience.",

        "caption": "I came here for our anniversary and had a terrible experience. We were treated as if because we were younger, our money isn\u2019t green. I\u2019ll separate this into two parts. Part one, a review of the food, and part two, a review of the experience.  Part One The food here is mediocre and there isn\u2019t much to choose from. We had the Capesante (which is TWO scallops) and the risotto for our appetizer. The Scallops were probably the best part of the entire meal and the risotto was just bland and flavorless. For our Entrees, we had Ravioli del Plin and the Anatra, which is duck breast. The Ravioli was the exact opposite of the risotto. Its favor was overpowering. After two bites, we couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. The duck breast wasn\u2019t anything special. It tasted the same as duck you get from a Chinese Take-Out Restaurant. I\u2019m not sure if we were complimenting Chinese Take-Out, or insulting Ristorante Tosca.  Part Two This was worst experience I\u2019ve had in a restaurant, which ruined our anniversary night. It started with us being seated in some corner table next to a wall. It was a Tuesday, so there were plenty of other seats, but we got seated on what seemed to be the worst spot. Then the wine. We ordered a bottle and our glasses were poured. After my first sip, I noticed there was something in my glass. It was a piece of the cork from the bottle. We mentioned this to the waitress, Angela, and were confronted with an ill-mannered response of \u201cOK. What do you want?\u201d We were shocked to hear such an aggressive response from a waitress that seemed like she\u2019s been in the business for some time. It was obviously the servers fault that there was cork in my bottle, since I never touched the cork nor the bottle. She brought the cork back out and you could see that there was a chip on the top of the cork. It was obviously her mistake, and instead of offering to replace my glass, we got a filthy \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d After that, our Entrees took about 50 minutes to get to our table from the time of our initial order. Meanwhile, the ladies that were next to us were greeting with complimentary glasses of champagne just for sitting down. Their salads and pasta entrees were in front of them within 30 minutes. Which just made us feel that because were a younger couple, we weren\u2019t a priority. It was disrespectful. Once we were done with our entrees, we were presented with a dessert menu which we declined. We were offered coffee and also declined, as we were done. I didn\u2019t know that declining dessert, coffee, and saying \u201cwe\u2019re done\u201d doesn\u2019t hint the waitress to bring out the check. We waited for 20 minutes and Angela never brought it around. We had to mention it to her again.  This restaurant was a terrible mistake. Usually we go to \"Fogo De Ch\u00e3o\" down the block for events like this, but we wanted to try something new. But instead Ristorante Tosca ruined our anniversary dinner. It would\u2019ve been at least somewhat pleasant if the food was great and the experience was bad, or vice versa. But they were both just as awful. They need to be grateful that we even decided to leave a tip at all, even if it was the standard 15%, for being disrespectful and discriminatory.  Also, how do you run out of lamb!?",

Before the meal we were given complimentary delights from the chef, which like the rest, tasted authentic and great! I had gnocchi, which, like any of the other pastas I tasted was so different from other Italian food I've had, but so great.
