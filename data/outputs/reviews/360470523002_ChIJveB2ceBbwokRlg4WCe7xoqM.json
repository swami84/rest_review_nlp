The slice was very small but for the price in quality that was a 5* experience.  Unfortunately, the gnocchi dish I had didn\u2019t reach the same highs:  the vegetable medley didn\u2019t taste super fresh, so even though the broth and the gnocchi itself were well done my overall impression of the dish was pretty negative. Wasn\u2019t a big fan of the fries other:  the seasoning was uneven and again the end result didn\u2019t taste that fresh.  Overall for the price point I had higher expectations.

Now about food: (we chose chefs choice) ~11 dishes to try which were arriving to the table right off the flame. Check out the photos,  they not only looked good and nicely plated, but were also delicious and all were able to split to 4 people. Signature drinks were nicely made,  without a smell of alcohol but at 3rd sip they catch up with you. Attentive Traif team were taking care of the smaller sized table where our empty dishes didn't stand on the table long and new dish was served.   Overall we had a nice and pleasant experience.

It was the picture of the spare ribs with strawberries that convinced me! (I do not understand why a logo of  a pig would make anyone want to go here!) The pictures of the food are amazing! After seeing the pictures I  did not need to read anything I was there! The menu was innovative. My husband and I share most meals so the sharing theme was just right for us. The menu is seasonal so the ribs were not strawberry but they were Pomegranate. But it was still delicious! I do not eat large portions of meat any more. The portions were not too big or too small and at first I did not know how much I could eat but they were melt in your mouth like cotton candy! We also  had the pink fig salad and lamb Shawarma. We had the bacon donuts for dessert. I liked it so much I would even take out of town friends here! My criteria for 5 stars  is it is the best of it's kind. I do not know if it is but the food and decor were so nice. The server and owner were very congenial. The bathroom was clean and there were pictures of the staff in the bathroom as children. They said they want to make it like a family atmosphere. I would love to go back for each season! We went midweek and it was not too crowded. I like going out week nights especially to popular places like this, the wait usually is not as long and you don't feel rushed.Obviously this was before the lockdown. The space is cramped though once they open back up be prepared.",

The menu is interesting: recommend the seared foie gras, it is quite good. The General Tso\u2019s sweetbreads was interesting, bit overwhelming in savor, but good. Dessert wise, the buckwheat cake was astonishingly good. Also tried the donuts and the key lime. Key lime had some interesting remoulade that was tangy and sweet. Donuts came with a scoop of dulce de leche and fleckled with bacon bits. Also tried the butternut squash soup, very delightful, in small doses. My friend made the joke that the soup tasted like it was made with bouillon cubes which I didn\u2019t disagree with.",

Atmosphere:  There's a fine line between \"shabby chic\" and just plan old \"shabby.\"  I feel this place was on the wrong side of that line -- at least in the \"garden room.\"  Please scrape the windows clean!!  2. This restaurant is very expensive for the location.  The menu is all small plates, so the waiter recommended 2 (or even 3) per person.  While some items were in the $12-15 range, others were as much as $27.  That's excessive if you have to order 2 (let alone 3)!  We spent over $50 per person, and that's without any wine or liquor.  Also note that Google mis-categorizes this restaurant as two dollar signs ($$), presumably based on the price of EACH small plate.  Google needs to account for the fact that you need to order more than one.  Be warned.",

While the interior is very small and cramped, and the air conditioner does its best to cool the place down, you will completely forget about your surroundings when you dig into the food.  The food was flavorful and rich, and seemed to cross borders, cultures and genres.  We had a summer caprese salad (with hot honey) and duck breast on a zucchini \"gold bar\" which were standout dishes and highly recommended.  The cocktails offered complimented the dishes well.  The service was fast and attentive.  I highly recommend this place for its unusual take on food across cultures.",

We did the chef\u2019s tasting menu, and I can honestly say it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I\u2019ve ever had. We were asked if we wanted anything specific from the menu in our tasting or if we wanted an adventurous selection. We opted for adventurous and definitely didn\u2019t get any of the more interesting options on the menu. The food came out so quickly that at times we had 3 plates in front of us, even though we asked for them to slow it down. I remember thinking the food was good, but 3 months later, I can\u2019t remember a single thing I ate because I was rushing to eat it. We were seated at the bar and asked 3 different staff members for water before we finally got some halfway through dinner. A couple next to us complimented the staff on the food, and the staff member actually said, \u201cGood. I hope it makes up for our terrible service.\u201d There were no apologies or any regard for what they obviously knew was awful service. I\u2019m happy to excuse some of these things at some restaurants, but not at one that is supposed to be of a higher caliber.",

I would recommend making reservations for a group because they had a lot of patrons waiting to eat there. 2 hours is allotted for your experience. We took a wrong turn getting there and before you know it, we're going across a bridge stuck in traffic. This made us 15 min late for our reservation but the service was very nice despite our tardiness. Our friends were 20 min late due to lack of parking spaces in the neighborhood.

The tasting menu begins with the only dish that's individually portioned; the \"complimentary\" gezpacho soup, with flavors proving that you get what you pay for. The tasting menu proceeds awkwardly between family style plates not suited to sharing (a pasta dish with a sunny side up egg resting on top to share between four people), concluding with individual portions of dessert like a slice of pie (also meant to be shared between four people). The best dish by far was the glazed rib, after the restaurants name-sake, which left all members of our 10 person party asking , why didn't we just order the ribs? It certainly would have been easier for the single waiter serving the entire restaurant. While on the lower end of tasting menus at $54 per person, chef has outsmarted himself and should go back to basics.",

When we walked in to the restaurant, we could already smell the grease from the kitchen. The ventilation finely need to be improved. Sure enough, quite a few items from the tasting menu we ordered were either deep fried or fried including two dishes with sunny side up eggs. Why?  Eventually we were so filled with greasy food that we were hoping that the end of the menu was approaching when the last two main dishes arrived: deep fried sweetbread and fried liver (they called it fois gras for some reason). Then of course they were followed with two desserts: one of them being a deep fried donut.  Another thing is the noise level. It was so loud that it was hard to hold a conversation. Thank goodness that the restaurant did not turn up the music to compete.",

We got seated at the back of the restaurant mirroring a small garden.  The menu is hard to read with its particular font and small printed size. The waiter suggested that 5-7 plates is a good amount for 2 people.  After placing our order, they gave us complimentary zucchini soups placed in two tiny mugs. The amount of the soup was about two sips. It was creamy and salty. A bit too salty. But I thank them for the food on the house.  We ordered 5 dishes that was suggested by our waiter and what it seemed most popular on yelp. The kitchen brought the dishes out in the order of those that seemed as appetizers to entrees. The spicy tuna tartar with fried eggplant was good, but lacked a little bit in flavor. The baked Muenster cheese was served with roasted crostinis and apples. Berkshire pork belly was very tender. The braised short rib bbq sliders were good, but I think we enjoyed the sweet potatoes fries more. They were just so crisp on the outside and soft inside. The sauce for the strawberry cinnamon port ribs were a bit too sweet, but overall every dish was good. Too bad we didn't have room for other dishes.  Street parking only. We were lucky to find a spot right outside of the restaurant, but give yourself an ample amount of time looking for a spot; it is as packed as anywhere else in nyc.",

Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s loud, you still shouldn\u2019t just drop a dish in front of us. And you shouldn\u2019t be blasting music in there like it\u2019s a rave in the first place. Everyone\u2019s screaming at that point. Tasting menu was mediocre. You get to pick two dishes and they \u201cbuild a custom menu for you\u201d. Even though they said it\u2019s curated specifically for you, you can tell just by looking around the restaurant that everyone is getting the same dishes. The tasting menu had dishes which are protein heavy, and they tasted great, but they start tasting the same when they just pair a savory meat with a citrus fruit glaze over and over again. We happen to get 3 of these. Probably not coming here again anytime soon.",

It's more of a tapas style I'd say so you may leave not being full.  Bacon Broth: It was a good sample of bacon broth. The flavor was rich, and I can imagine myself dipping bread, or having a soup based on this broth.  Fish with avocado: Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of this dish but it was my favorite. The fish was fresh and the avocado paired well with it. It was refreshing.  Scallops: DELICIOUS.  I'd have to update my review one day when I go back, since I don't remember much.  To skip to the desserts since I don't remember the name of the food I had, their bacon donuts was really good. I don't like bacon much, but the donuts were good and moist.",

I came here on NYE for the chefs menu with my special lady. Because my girlfriend has a small appetite and doesnt really like anything adventurous, we didnt go the BALLERS option but I recommend that to everyone else. Everything was great from the bacon broth, scallops and truffle risotto, prawn and polenta, tuna tartare on fried eggplant(absolutely to die for), salmon avocado sashimi, strawberry cinnamon ribs, duck breast, sweet breads, short ribs and foie gras sauce, and short rib sliders. And you cant forget the bacon donuts, the important thing isnt the bacon even though thats key, the dough of the donut was so light and airy almost like a souffle.  I highly recommend making a reservation to come and try the chef selection, you save money and get to try it all. If you can, go for the BALLERS.",

Flashback to 3/4 years ago when I heard about this chef who opened this cute restaurant in South Willy B and all the dishes were pork inspired and very inventive. I did some research and saw that they had a 11 course chef tasting. I booked my dinner party with 12 people and it went without a hitch! It was so memorable that my friends talk about it years later. Fast forward to this past weekend, where I made a reservation for me and my brother for his birthday dinner. I haven't been in 4 years and I was so nervous because I had high hopes and I didn't want to be disappointed. Well....they exceeded my expectations. The food, the service....they are the BLUEPRINT for what a restaurant should be. Now, the food from plate 1 to plate 11 was delicious. But My absolute faves are the strawberry ribs, roasted carrots, Cacio o Pepe pasta, salt and pepper shrimp. Last but not least, the Tuna tartare with the eggplant tempura. They let you chose 2 that you want in the tasting. Please do yourself a favor and request this. I don't have a favorite with desserts because I love them both. The panna cotta is literally bursting with flavor. I was pleasantly surprised with the sesame and cookie crumble. I love how Traif takes different ingredients and put them together and it tastes sooo good. For example,sunflower seeds with ice cream. Who knew!! Also, the bacon doughnut holes with coffee ice cream..... Years later and Traif doesn't disappoint.",

It looked so nice in the early evening and it's probably better lighting in that area for picture taking! By 7:00pm, the small space filled up quickly.  The dishes are tapas style and go from small to large down the menu list.  My friend and I ordered 4 small to medium dishes and it was enough food to be quite full!  Salt & pepper shrimp: DELICIOUS! There were sweet potato chunks in this dish that I absolutely LOVED and I'm not usually a huge fan of sweet potatoes.  The shrimp was breaded in a nice batter and super juicy and crunchy.  The dish was not too flavorful or salty and the portion was satiating.  Icy blue mussels: The mussels were soaked in a pesto pea soup.  Don't neglect the delicious fluffy buttered toast wedges on the side.  They were soooo delicious!  The mussels were served in a generous portion.  I wasn't as big of a fan of the peas as my friend was.  Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs: AMAZING.  My favorite dish of the night! The meat fell right off the bone.  The tenderness of the meat was paired with a nice BBQ sauce made of cinnamon and strawberry reduction.  The cinnamon aspect was really unique, but not too overwhelmingly pungent.  BBQ, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli: The sliders are about 3-4 bites so don't expect anything extravagantly large.  The short ribs resembled something similar to pulled pork - shredded and juicy.  The sweet potato fries were fried lightly so they had the perfect texture.  The smoked paprika aioli was great, but moderate - it's a bit salty!  Unfortunately, we so full that we didn't have any room for the infamous bacon doughnuts, but I'll definitely be back for more!  The menu changes month to month so I'm looking forward to trying something new.",

Ever since I joined Tasting Collective, the name Traif kept coming up as everyone\u2019s favorite restaurant event. And this is a diners club of food lovers, I had to go and try it out!  The interior is simple and industrial, chilled, and with very cool, modern, abstract art decor throughout. I liked the mix of straight and curved lines, minimal but yet distinctive colors, simple furniture and warm, soft light inviting customers in. They had a very lovely patio in the back. I really liked it here, it had more natural light coming in before the Sun went down, and then lit up with festive string lights. They had good amount of greenery around it that made the space even more relaxing.  We started off with a couple of drinks. We chose Yuzu Kosho and Drink Like its Spring. They were both very tasty, high quality and strong. For food, we got to try Crispy Sweetbreads, Cured Fluke Sashimi, Dry-Aged Venison, Roasted Berkshire Pork Belly, Roasted Rainbow Carrots, Salt & Pepper Hamachi Collar Wraps, Seared Scallops & Risotto, Smoked Lamb Puttanesca Cavatelli, Toasted Pistachio Budino, and Warm Sugar Maple Pie. All these dishes, one word: Amazing!!!  I now know the reason why this is the most popular spot among the Tasting Collective members. My taste buds were having the time of their lives the entire night! I would love to go back again for more of their amazing dishes!

There were a few good dishes but a few bad dishes as well. The good plates: tuna tartare on a fried eggplant, fried shrimp with pineapple (sauce was good), foie gras, the scallops, and the fried doughnuts with bacon bits and coffee ice-cream. The okay/bad plates: the salad, short ribs, goat cheese, the pork bun sliders, the cheesecake. You'd think a place with such great reviews and with $$$, every plate would be delicious but guess not.",

Reservations are highly recommended and they accept them 30 days in advance.  We opted in for the tasting menu which was really good  and the wait staff accommodated all our requests. We tried several of the cocktails- all of which were interesting but I would recommend wine for the tasting menu.  Between Xixa and Traif I preferred Xixa but that could have been because of the menu they were offering when we ate there. The quality of the service was great and the Traif experience was worth the bill.",

I made reservations 4 weeks out and the process works like this... they don't pick up their phone till after 6, so you call them while they're in the middle of their packed and busy dinner service. You say you want a reservation, they put you on hold. They come back on and ask for date, time, name, and contact info. Then you're called back in around 20 minutes confirming your reservation. Simple enough but tedious.  I forgot to write down the time of my reservation and I couldn't remember if the reservation was for 6:30 or 6:45. This was entirely my fault and it's no big deal since restaurant normally call 24-72 hours ahead of time to confirm that everything's all set. But they didn't call, so I called the day before. The person who picked up told me they'd have to call me back, and four hours later at 10pm I still hadn't heard anything and tried calling again. And instead of getting an answer I got a lecture about how the don't keep their reservation book downstairs and I was calling in the middle of service so I wasn't going to get an answer.  I understand it's a really small restaurant but for its level of popularity there could be a better reservation system.  Whatever it happened, I can deal because the food and service that I received on the day of my dinner service was almost perfect and deserving of 5 stars. We arrived 15 minutes early but were seated right away, our server was new but friendly and the service went smoothly. We ordered five dishes and one dessert: the pork belly, chicken liver, pork cheeks, ribs, scallop risotto, and bacon dulce de leche donuts.  The pork cheeks were uninspiring, and the pork belly was over cooked making it rather rough to eat. But the flavors were still there and good. The stars of the night for me were the scallops and donuts. The scallops were cooked lightly seared and perfect, with a squash risotto. They complemented well and I highly recommend this dish to everyone. Bacon dulce de leche donuts with cappuccino ice cream, speaks for itself. My partner is a big fan of cappuccino ice cream, didn't like the ice cream that much but I was in love.",

With the tasting option for three, we were able to try most of the menu, and sharing small plates of course was easier than eating off each other's plates as we end up doing elsewhere.  So good! The wait staff was really great to seat us and let us know that they needed the table back in an hour--which ended up meaning our food was expedited and it was awesome. They were also very patiently informative about each dish and honest about personal favorites. Sat in the back.  Would love to try Xixa (same restaurant group) soon and also come back to Traif when the menu's switched up.",

Everything is served tapas style but they're hefty so don't get it confused... you will NOT leave hungry under any circumstance.  Considering the ample amount of reviews on Traif, I'll keep it short and simple. If there's one thing I'd recommend you order it would be the scallops. They were cooked to perfection, fresh, simple and complex. A beautiful oxymoron for sure.

We got the Strawberry cinnamon glazed Ribs- amazing! The Eggplant Tuna Tartar was possibly my favorite but how do you compare that to Scallop Corn Rissotto which Yes- I literally licked the plate! Okay yes I was full but we weren't leaving without trying the Bacon Doughnuts and Traif staff obliged letting us drink more water and relax to make room. They were busy so I felt bad at first but they didn't seem fazed and didn't make me feel rushed at all. Just keep enjoying your meal our waiter said. And we did. It was sooo good.

Located in Williamsburg, this restaurant, whose name means \"unkosher\" in Yiddish, serves up a creative and ever-changing menu of small plates. There's no cuisine or genre to describe it, as dishes pull in influences from all across the globe. Take the glazed confit chicken wings, which are made with hoisin, five spice and sriracha for instance, or the hampshire pork belly, garnished with hearts of palm, bacon, artichoke, and clementine slices. Vegetables are heavily featured as well, although as the name of the restaurant would indicate, it's not a good place to go with vegetarians. Reservations in advance are recommended, and groups of four or more can get the $40 tasting menu.",

The guy behind the bar was fighting the good fight by holding up glasses to the barely there lighting so that he didn't serve any with water spots. There was a spotlight in the prep area so that the servers could at least see the dishes before they went out. The rest of the kitchen... dim.  Traif is loud. I mean LOUD. Like Grand Central loud. Actually worse since it's not such a large space. It became of vicious cycle of shouting. And really lady... nobody has to laugh that loud outside of a comedy show. If you can, sit in the separate area in the rear.  If you have a jacket or purse, don't sit at the bar. There's no place to put your belongings but on the chair next to you. And if they need the seat... you're crap out of luck.  The portions are small plates. You find that out right away when your server asks you incredulously if \"that's all you want??\"  I ordered the BBQ Sliders. They come with two sliders & sweet potato fries. You get a very yummy roasted pepper soup amuse bouche that just makes you want more. Now out come the sliders. They made my stomach mad just looking at them.  Then I ate one sweet potato fry. Dear God up in Heaven was that good! I think they breaded the sweet potato fries with Angel Dust. Not metaphorically... with actual psychedelic drugs. I destroyed them how Godzilla destroyed Tokyo. They give you the option to add a third slider to the entree, but what they should do is allow you to just order the sweet potato fries on the side. I want to bathe in them.  Since I only ordered 3 Sliders, I had plenty of room for dessert. I normally don't, so it was a prime time to have the famous bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. First off, I love coffee ice cream. I love bacon. I love doughnuts. Put all three together and BLAM! And you get a nice amount of them too. They were most likely to share, but don't. Eat them all yourself.  Maybe I came on some weird Loud Talker Night but I would gladly go again just for those fries. I'll give away the sliders and order some other entree just to get the fries. Good God the fries!",

If you're having trouble picking you can always hand ball the decision to the crew for the $45 a head tasting menu. Stand-outs are the scallops, the black nectar pluots, with sour cherries, bacon and blue cheese, and any of the desserts.",

One good thing to know before going there is that the plates are slightly smaller than usual and meant more for sharing several dishes, rather than ordering one big entree.  I loved that this style allowed me to sample so many different plates, since everything on the menu sounded so delicious.  My one complaint is that there was a very long gap between my 3rd and 4th dishes, and it took about 20 minutes to get the check.  Honestly, I could have probably grabbed a server and asked for my check sooner.  All in all, a great restaurant.  Looking forward to eating here again!",

As much as I like tapas because of all the different dishes you can get, it's a little hard to go with a large group unless you order a lot of them because everyone has their own favorites.

Be prepared to be taken on a 9 course tasting meal that goes from light to heavy. This is the way to go for a first timer and until you know what you like, that's when you go A la Carte.  The ambiance is hip and carefree. The music is low but still intelligible to the ears and gives it that nice eating mood that only comes with chill indie music.  For the food, by far the highlight of the courses were the seafood dishes. The sea scallops were seared to perfection and had a nice little hint of spice.  The blowfish was also very interesting. It was my first time eating blowfish and I was hoping I wasn't going to die, like in The Simpsons. Fortunately they were using the sac, but rather just the tail. So I was safe. Phew. That was close.  The bacon doughnuts at the end...wow. That was awesome. Gotta get that for sure. Happiness in your mouth!",

Calling ahead for an appointment at 5 in the evening proved fruitless: they don\u2019t take reservations once they start service but the hostess earnestly implored us to come by at 11 or so at the chance of grabbing some walk in seats.  When we did finally go a few weeks later I casually sauntered into a mostly empty place for a 7 pm reservation. A few early diners were being seated, the very small and tight kitchen, exposed for all to see, was ensuring that their mise was, well, in the right place, and the lone bartender drying and priming glasses. A few cocktails later (the Navy grog bearing no resemblance to its namesake) and the conversation flowed between the bartender and me. Despite Traif\u2019s reputation it was a very comfortable place. Bright colors and custom paint marked the d\u00e9cor and the single unisex bathroom didn\u2019t try to sweat modernism. Lit on the dark side, the plethora of tables for two was accompanied by a few larger (4-6) tables- I didn\u2019t get a chance to peek at the outdoor/indoor seating area. At home I rarely splurge on the good (spoken: expensive) alcohol but I was delighted to experience Scarlet Ibis Rum. If the quality of that one spirit is any indication of Traif\u2019s libation repertoire then you should walk away satisfied and slightly tipsy.  Traif makes an excellent choice for the 2nd to 4th dates. The tables are intimate and the shared tapas style dishes pull no punches in clanging of forks or the mixing of portions. The waitress did a fine job guiding the number of dishes we chose (6 or so for a couple) and we were never wanting of her attention.  It was surprising to see how rapidly chairs were filled and AMAZING how quickly orders were filled from the single stove. A slurp of bacon soup was a complimentary amuse-bouche. Although their online dinner menu isn\u2019t entirely accurate we did try a variety of dishes. Tenderloin slices were tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. Chicken wings gooey sweet more so than hot. Pork belly slices were melt in your mouth delicious. A lobster pasta looked and tasted green. Veal sweetbreads with lobster specks a delight; this was probably the most flavor complex dish we had. And finally, but not least, the braised beef slider was a bombshell. You don\u2019t choose the order of the dish rollout and they prefer you put in for everything at once but I am very reluctant to judge the individual dishes. The variety they offer should satisfy most customers although the number of strictly vegetarian dishes was minimal. By the end of tapas #6 we were truly stuffed but my taste buds were not dancing.  Most of the tapas had mild flavor profiles although the slider was a standout.  We left happy customers after skipping desert but appreciating a super sweet cube of pineapple to the low roar of the crowd. Clientele was mostly fashionable but it didn\u2019t seem to matter: Traif is a comfortable place to share decent food and drink among good friends or perhaps a future-future-future-perfect boyfriend.  Drinks: 8/10 for a friendly bartender that is a multitasking master yet still aims to please. Food: 6/10 for a creative variety that is a little weak on the flavor elevator. NYCism: 9/10 for providing that comfortable start to a 20-something friends night out.",

A great meal ignites the senses and feels inspirational. Traif is very high on my list places to recommend when they simply want a fantastic meal. It reminded me why I go out to restaurants in the first place. The creativity, the execution... everything.",

They do a big, set-price menu for larger groups, and it worked since most friends are down for a goood meal. The timing was well done, great cocktails, good service, and flexible with my party size changing. Went back for brunch a few months later in a small group and had another delicious meal!",

Food is great but the portions are super small (this is not on the menu, but it would be like 6 brussel sprouts for $10..they'll be amazing brussel sprouts, but since when was S 4th Soho prices?). Service nothing special. Won't go back, even though I practically live next door. All the new lawyers in the neighborhood probably love the place though, since it's always packed.",
