I usually go for the tacos with chicken, but the seasoned pork and bulgogi beef are worth having. The burritos are out of this world with bacon fried rice & kimchi, and both the totchos and ramen-seasoned fries are a must-try. (Ignore the ketchup packets with the fries.)

All of his recommendations were on point\u2014the crispy tofu was super crunchy, the spicy toki sauce added great flavor, and the avocado he added on top helped temper the heat. At $9 for a huge rice bowl it\u2019s really a lunch no-brainer. It\u2019d be nice if they could make the space feel more homey and suited to people that want to sit and stay for a while.
