When I first moved to Malden I frequented Jay's Ice Cream \ud83c\udf66 and Pizza \ud83c\udf55 the food was fresh as well as the Ice Cream.  Somewhere along the way things changed and NOT for the better.  The restaurant at 1 point made me wonder if they were ever inspected in this town.  Ice Cream was freezer burned the staff was unfriendly and you saw the decline fast and furiously.  Less cars \ud83d\ude97 in the parking lot on a summer Sunday.  Their are quite a few bad reviews somewhere on the internet about them from me. I just stopped any relationship with that restaurant.  New Owner New Passion  Fast forward to the present...... the Staff is friendly and professional. The food fresh and delicious.  The restaurant clean and upgraded.  If you were a fan of Jay's back in the day.  If you stopped your patronage for the same reasons as I. Then you need to know Jay's has been reborn.  I have been there quite a bit lately. Still reasonably priced meals and of course fresh creamy delicious \ud83e\uddca \ud83c\udf66.  You scream they scream we all scream for ICE CREAM!",

They made some of the most authentic Nepalese momo that you can find around Boston area that lured us to take at least four trips every month of 27 minutes each way.  The last three times has been terrible though. A lot of dough and less meat, the taste has evolved in the opposite direction to what we love. Fried Pork momo was our favorite dish from Jay's, so in addition to chicken jhol momo, we always order fried pork momo. You can see the photo of the FRIED PORK MO:MO we received today. Its completely RAW INSIDE. I thought they crossed the limit of NEGLIGENCE with this, and hence this review. A PORK dish, serving RAW to the COSTUMER. The waiter we talked with actually told use there was another case of RAW BEEF in another food earlier today. THIS HAS TO STOP. THEY NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT CONSUMER HEALTH.

We ordered a Jay's Hungry Man Pizza (tenders, fries, mozz sticks) to try. When we got our order it was more of a meat lover's pizza. We called and asked why this was and they told us it was a part of the menu change. They asked where we ordered and we told them slice. They stated that the menu has changed everywhere else and Slice must have been missed. When we went and checked at the other sites (including their own) the pizza was still being advertised. We ordered a replacement as we were not expecting a meat lover's and decided to get just a simple cheese pizza. They then charged us the full amount and just said sorry hope to have you order again. I get that things cost money and I'm not looking for a handout, but own your mistakes and don't keep old menu items on ALL platforms people order from. After this I don't think we will be ordering here again.",

I call to order a delivery and the person on the phone said didnt you just call, which i hadnt so i told her no and proceded with my order. The total for 2 large pizzas was 32.49 which i didnt expect for for one cheese and one buffalo chicken pizza, but It was late and i had hungry children so I accepted it and i was quote 45 mins. At 10pm, by 11p I saw missed calls from there driver so I called back and he told me he left after waiting in his car for 10mins. But I was outside and asked him did he ring my door bell and he said no. He said he went to deliver another order and would be back in 7-8 mins. 15mins later the a cashier from the store called and said the driver went to my house and no body was there. And i explained i was home but the driver never came out his car, and I already talked to him and he said he was would be back in 8 mins but he still had not returned. The cashier told me the driver was at the store, but would be coming now. I was upset because it was now 11:30p. The cashier apologized and said he just left. My family and i were seated on our porch aNd the driver parked in his car call to tell me he was there. But waited in his car for us to come to him. I told him he need to come to the porch. Once the pizza arrived it was warm not hot anymore and the driver told us the total was 34 and he had no change for a 40. By this point i had no intention of tipping him, and I gave him the total i was given over the phone. When I call the store to complain about the driver no one answered. I to say the least will NEVER order from there again. And I hope the owners are aware of the horrible customer service that was give. For pizza that was just sub pare. I advice anyone reading to go to New York pizza which is up the street but better pizza and service.",

The pizza was okay, but I did not open the quart that night as I felt full after eating the whole pizza. Then a couple days later I opened the quart to discover they gave me the wrong flavor (Vanilla - who gets an entire quart of Vanilla???). It was late Sunday night so I called and asked about it and the guy on the phone said I'd have to call back when one of the managers was around.  I called the next day and after several minutes of discussion, where I gave my name, address, credit card number, total amount, and even the time I ordered I finally got a response from the manager (he had to call me back about 20 minutes later claiming he was having trouble with the computer). He PROMISED me that because of the mistake that the next order I made I would get a free quart because of their mistake,as long as I ordered with the same address and phone number as the previous order, and that he had put a note into the system that I was to be compensated for this.  Fast forward to just a few minutes ago where the restaurant flat out refused to honor this manager's promise, told me \"there's nothing we can do\" and then HUNG UP ON ME in the middle of the call. These people are a bunch of incompetent liars and they don't deserve to even be in business. From this incident alone it's obvious to see they don't give a rat's ass about customer service or even own up to their mistakes, and anyone ordering from this dump should be extremely wary to do so as they clearly are only interested in swindling you out of your hard earned money.",

And considering this is supposed to be an establishment welcoming to children?! for approx. 30 minutes i witnessed the manager and other employee's chatting with two customers about \"wetbacks\", about \"stupid customers\" that they have to give free ice cream to just to \"keep them happy\", about \"doing cocaine\" and listened to cuss and swears almost every 3rd or 4th word from each of them! ( 3 employees and 2 customers). I confronted tehm after the custoemrs left and the manager apologized, but i truely don't think he cared now that i read all these previous reviews... they have not changed how they represent the shop. they act like they are in their mother's basement paying video games and getting high! I don't care what you do at home but learn some respect and profesionalism for while you're at work! disgusting. if you want great ice cream go to J.P Licks at Assembly Row in Somerville. They give free tastings, they are respectful, professional and welcoming. And their ice cream is amazing. Want a great pizza/sub etc shop, go to Alfrado's Kitchen. Jay's just need to be put down.",

Today they delivered in a short time period (45 minutes) and the pizza was cold to the touch, the cheese had already cooled and crust was hard like it'd was cooked over an hour ago. I called up and the manager argued with me that it's impossible it was cold cause he just cooked it 10 minutes ago. I told him I was holding up two slices by the corner with no bending and he got upset saying I was wrong. No steam is on the cardboard, no condensation on the pizza from it being warm. I said I'd drive it back personally (5 minute drive) and he refused as it'd be cold by then. I asked how a hot pizza can get cold in 5 minutes and he skipped to asking what I wanted like I was trying to extort something. He said he'd put a credit on my account...Attached to my phone number but it didn't sound sincere. He's sending another pizza but I don't know if I trust how it's made due to the hostile call I had. I ordered a lot from Jay's and it's now the last time I'm buying from them.",

        "caption": "STAY AWAY!  I took my wife and three young kids (ages 2, 6 and 9) to try to get a Christmas tree at Jay's Pizza and Ice Cream yesterday.  We were verbally assaulted by the owner!  All we did was ask the price of the tree. He muttered some nasty words in the direction of my wife and stormed off.  When I asked what the issue was, he said my wife and I were rude to him and needed to apologize to him!  If we did, he'd be happy to sell us a tree. If not, he would \"escort us off the premises!\" We were in no way rude. We had just walked in to buy a tree there as we have for the last 10 years. We simply asked what the price was.  I went into the store to try to find out who the owner was, and what their affiliation was with the Christmas tree people. He followed me in, took out his cell phone and threatened to call the cops! (Which would have been fine if I was there alone... I didn't think my kids needed more trauma that night!)  My wife took our kids, all very upset of course, back to the car.... no tree.  The only information I could get was that his name is George. He refused to let me speak with anyone else there and came up towards me to physically remove me from the building! I left!  I called back today to see if the owner was available. Apparently George is the owner. He hung up on me.  I called the police to report him today, and they said they've gotten many complaints about him.  I'm not sure what his issues are, but he needs help. It's sad that our Christmas tree tradition had to end like that! I know kids have to learn about dealing with rude people, but shopping for a Christmas tree wasn't the time I thought we'd be dealing with that issue.  As a side note, although we've never really liked the food, we've gone to Jay's for ice cream before. We love supporting local businesses and we love our neighborhood. So this was particularly sad.  On a happier side note:  When we got back in the car last night, we googled \"Christmas Tree Malden,\" and found VFW Christmas Trees and Wreaths on 114 Mystic Ave in Medford. We went right over, got a great tree, (they were super nice, btw), and proceeds support the VFW. As a bonus, they are located right near the real life \"Grandfathers House\" from the poem and song \"Over the River and Through the Woods\" which we sang as we drove by! New family tradition!",

The employees at the store were EXTREMELY RUDE & UNCARING about my whole experience.  However, they had no problem \"stealing\" the money for the undelivered order from my checking account.  This was not the first time I had an undesirable event with this store, however, time went by and we thought we would give them another chance.  SAME OUTCOME!!!!!  It's the RUDENESS & the OUTRIGHT LYING of the employees that my stomach cannot take!!!!!  Good luck JAY'S",

I bought a quart of ice cream a couple of days ago that was not as good as usual.  I phoned and asked if it was still Richardson's (a wonderful ice cream).  The manager said that they had run out of that flavor and so what they given me was Hood ice cream.  I asked if they would replace it with a quart of Richardson's which is what I thought that I was buying and was told that they could not.  I find that appalling.  I ask for one product, am given another, and they will not replace it?  Ridiculous!   I don't plan to go there again.  Bye.",

Customer service is terrible and no one seems to want to improve it. No one listens to how you would like you order, they just do whatever. I would suggest ordering with in the store or pick up to get food that is warm. Otherwise Id go elsewhere for subs and pizza.",
