Breakfast plate and a good amount of eggs, grits, sausage. The chicken sandwich was great, cheese and sweet onion sause on top with good amount of fries. The burger was well done with a side of still juicy. The waitress offered us the many good condiments the resturant offered. Wonderful place. The homemade foccaica and ricotta cheese needed something!!!",

And the steak my friend got was almost colder then the lettuce on my plate ! My point is.. customer service has got to get better! Just because were Latinos doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to pay ! It wasn\u2019t nice at all. I\u2019m rating it a high 1 star only because my wine was cold and I love wine. But to be fairly honest they never asked if I wanted to another glass of wine... sorry won\u2019t come again.",

I should have left right when I witnessed that, but to make matters even worse.. Once we were by miracle finally seated, we were sitting and waiting for over 20 minutes. No wait staff ever came over to even give us water. We went up to the bartender asking if someone is coming and she said she\u2019ll send someone over. A few minutes later and still no one. What is so difficult to walk over to a table and even give them water? The table next to us who were seated 2 minutes before us weren\u2019t ignored the way we were. I\u2019ll never come back here again since this place likes to pick and choose who to serve. We got up and left. They lost our business today and forever",

Anyway, that swayed me to give them an extra star to raise the rating. I'll leave the psychology of that reaction to the professionals and describe my meal. I got a cocktail; the one with tequilla. It was excellent. Cab franc with dinner excellent also. The sunchoke app and the pork belly app were good. Not amazing, but different and good. I got the lamb ragu and it was excellent. 5 stars on that dish. My friend got the steak, I tried it and it was OK. I wouldn't recommend ordering that here; go somewhere else if you want steak. Other friend ordered the burger and normally I wouldn't taste someone else's burger... not the kind of delivery system you share, you know? But she insisted and let me tell you, it's one of the best bites of burger I've ever had. Desserts were so-so, I'd recommend just getting the cheese plate for dessert, that was quite good.",

All the tables are full btw.  Service is very quick. They got you menu and right down to ordering. I think our food and coffee came within 5 minutes. Best part is unlimited coffee and they come around pretty often to fill you up.  My salmon with bread is amazing. I wished I got a hot breakfast but coffee is good enough. For a table of four, we tried three of their dishes and they can be found in the picture.  Price is reasonable. What do I know? I know it's expensive to run a restaurant and $15 for a seat down meal isnt that bad. Brunch for four will set you back about $100.",

Each time, I was given no confirmation and treated with disregard - as if they couldn\u2019t be bothered with my concern over whether my Thanksgiving dinner reservation was happening or not. Customer service doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority of theirs.

Aside from that there were only 2 things on the entire menu that were appetizing-the pork mouse and the burger-both were almost inedible. The burger was completely over spiced and over cooked and the pork mouse tasted disgusting with long twigs in it.

What I expected and what showed up were totally different. But in a good way. It was a nice surprise. No overly greasy breaded fried okra, nope. Slim, tasty okra surrounded by scallions,  a red raspberry looking sauce and cream.  Omg, cream! My wife ordered the edamame toast, and it was delicious. Then the dessert that she ordered was amazing. So yeah, go. Enjoy. And be glad you did!",

It's on the expensive side but completely worth it, in my opinion. They also have a generous cheese plate. Oh, and the various saucy concoctions paired with the various dishes are always amazing and completely unlike anything I know how to prepare at home. Jeez, now I am craving their food!",

        "caption": "When I first wrote my review of the Farm nearly 6 months ago, I was highly impressed. However, after visiting the Farm five more times, and three times in the last two weeks, I'm increasingly disappointed in the service, quality of the food, and what you get for what you pay.  While the food is normally good, it's also extremely overpriced. 14$ for two slices of bread and three small slices of cheese? $12 for a mimosa made with extremely flat sparkling wine and cut with at least 50-70% orange juice? And fries that come out 25 minutes after ordering, cold and soggy? That was just my experience today. And keep in mind, I have fairly low standards as long as I get to eat.  And what about the waitresses who aren't fully trained yet? I try to be a nice consumer, but I've noticed significant price discrepancies when I get my bill. If the online menu lists one price, the paper menu lists another, and the bill lists yet another... that's ridiculous. And of course, the upsurge always runs in the Farm's favor. (I would have fought my last bill, but I had to leave to catch a train). I tipped anyways.  They're also not as vegetarian friendly as they used to be. The chefs/ waitresses also used to be more flexible on making substitutions (swapping meat for veggie entrees). I haven't had much luck in the past few weeks... I wonder if the waitresses are too timid to ask the chefs to whip up stuff off the menu anymore. I'm fairly jaded, and I'm not sure if I'd go back again.  *~*~*~*~ My original review, see below *~*~*~  I went to dinner with a few friends of mine at The Farm on Adderley & the food & atmosphere was excellent. Quiet enough for a lively conversation, but the music isn't too blaring or club-like. Kind waiters. Perfect for a get-together, and it's wheelchair accessible too! (Unlike a lot of restaurants in the neighborhood). And the bartender even had an iPhone charger he let me borrow since my phone had died. 10/10 recommend.  They don't have many vegetarian options on the menu, but the staff is perfectly fine fixing up something \"off the menu\" to accommodate. Perf!",

After notifying that two main ingredients are not available and answering two questions, waiter had to leave for 7-8 more minutes. We realized that getting a waiter again would be hard so we pushed through the order. Also finding out that apple cider was also not available. Drinks started to arrive 45 min after the reservation time and food started getting to the table 1 hour and 10 min in. The menu is not extensive and for anyone with a simple pallet is way too advanced. Options are mostly healthy which is generally good, but for someone not used to it could be a disappointment. Overall food if you like advanced flavors is good and tasty, but was overshadowed by the long wait and disappointed friends and kids. Kids burger was not cooked to order, why did they bother asking how it should be cooked? After asked for the check, it took over 20 minutes to produce one which again showed that there is no concept of time here.  So in all, don\u2019t think I will be back. If you plan to come for a brunch consider your schedule and if you want an experience where a time is not an issue and you want the chef to decide for you what to eat and how it\u2019s cooked, by all means go for it, I am sometimes into that myself, but not when you invite someone less adventurous and also with plans after.",

They served me something that look like chicken soup which cost 22 dollars. They claim that it is a main dish. I've been to restaurants in high priced neighborhoods and received a lot of food for the same price that they are charging. The restaurant is not located in a high priced neighborhood like downtown Brooklyn so why are the prices so high? Also, the service is slow. I took my mom there for mother's day and she told me that it was the worst restaurant that she has ever been to. They ruined my Mother's Day.",

Dishes are definitely filling. The reason I knocked down a star is due to the wait time. We were told that a table would be ready in 20 minutes and we were sat in 10 so we were happy. We received our drinks right away, but the food took over 30 minutes to arrive. They were very busy as it was 12pm on a Sunday when we arrived, but a 40 minute wait for food is a little ridiculous. Aside from the long wait for our food, the staff was friendly and always kept checking on us, reassuring that the food would come soon. Food was absolutely fantastic but I suggest to go before or after Brunch Rush.",

Since it was my first time, she gave a few recommendations on what to eat. I ultimately chose the chicken burger (I think there's like an official name on the menu but I don't quite remember). The burger was delicious and was so rich and complex in flavor. The chicken was nice and juicy as well. Their ketchup tastes like it was made fresh and their curry mayo dip was also really good. I really like the vibes and atmosphere of the place. Lots of natural sunlight. I'm pretty sure I'll return .",

The waiter was just OK in the back room you could seen he was stressed out, no idea why... maybe the crowd?? We ordered seasonal mimosas, and they were OK. I was kind of disappointed there. Too much juice. My husband ordered the egg sandwich with jam and cheddar on a brioche. Came with a little side salad. The salad def needs some more dressing! The sandwich was ok but a brioche is a wrong choice of bread. I ordered the Farmers Breakfast with Yukon and Red sweet potatoes toast eggs... Everything on the plate was SOOOO DRY. I had to drink water every time I took a bite. DRY. I waved to the waiter many times before he saw me. All I\u2019ve wanted was salt and pepper, because it\u2019s as if they put no seasoning. Heh. Yes At the end, 2 mimosas, one egg sandwich and my plate of dryness cost 65$ with the tip. Wow. Never making this mistake again.",

I got the Wild Shrimp Dumplings for my appetizer and the Sea Bass as my main. The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection. The service from the waitstaff was on point and the atmosphere is very comfortable. This is definitely a place to check out in Ditmas Park. Will definitely come back....",

I ordered the Farmer\u2019s Breakfast and when asking to substitute grits for the potatoes -even stating I\u2019d pay extra for it- I was told that this is probably not possible. Let\u2019s explore this...I\u2019m willing to pay extra for grits -that you already make anyway for other dishes- and not willing to accept extra money (and I\u2019m sure make a profit from it), which would make me come back. Moreover, the menu states that the Farmers breakfast comes with Pecorino, which is a cheese, yet there was no cheese in the eggs or anywhere on the plate. And, after bringing it to the waiter\u2019s attention, he said the Farmers Breakfast does not come with cheese. Uh...the waiter doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s on the menu???? Highly disappointed and won\u2019t be back here.",

My friend and I wanted to grab a bite for lunch and I've always had great experiences at The Farm that we chose to go there. We walked in and were seated right away, but our order was only taken way after that, (mind you, they were not busy at all).  Finally, a waitress comes over and takes our order but of course they were out of the one thing on the menu I wanted. I chose a similar sandwich (Monk fish sandwich instead of hake) but asked them to make sure no cheese is added as I'm intolerant.  We waited about 20 minutes before I noticed that my sandwich was sitting on the counter while they were waiting for my friends burger to be ready. Mortifying right? They bring it to our table and of course I mentioned that it's probably cold, I watched it sit on the counter for at minimum 10 minutes. She offered to reheat it albeit it wouldn't taste fresh. I agreed to that but when she came back with my reheated sandwich, guess what?!?!? There was cheese on the sandwich.  Quite comical, I know. At this point I had lost my appetite and was pretty much fed up. I told her to take it back and I wasn't going to order anything else. At least they had the decency not to charge me for it.  At this point, I really do not recommend The Farm for lunch dinner or brunch. Take your money to a place that has stellar service and good food. The Farm definitely lost me as a patron.",

I had the farmer's breakfast which is a bit of scrambled eggs over some potatoes, toasts, and swiss chard. I enjoyed it but it wasn't overly flavorful or all that memorable. Then again, I am also not much of \"brunch\" person, so if this is the type of food you're into, I think you'll enjoy it more than I did.

It was under-seasoned and very very plain. I liked the texture of the toast, and I hated the bitter Swiss Chard. The eggs were simple and fluffy. NOTHING SPECIAL. My friend had the Farm Burger and it was delicious! The burger was perfectly medium rare and their ingredients are all organic and fresh. You can definitely taste the quality in the food! The burger is also served on an English Muffin which was perfect \ud83d\udc4c. At this point, I gave up eating my Farmers Breakfast and requested to eat half of my friend\u2019s dish, to which he obliged. We all shared the fries that came with Curry Mayo and Marinara(?). As much as I hated my plate, everything was resolved with those fries. The Curry Mayo was everything and the taste was amazing. A MUST TRY!",

I\u2019ve had a few  negative service experiences over a year ago and decided to only order pickup instead. Not quite recalling why I stopped coming here, my friend decided she wanted to stop in for a bite. Within just a few minutes of the waitress introducing herself I realized why I usually go out of my way to place an order over the phone and walk all the way to the restaurant and pickup my food instead of dine in. After asking us if we\u2019d like to start off with a drink I pointed out my friend because I did not want to be rude and go first. My friend and I were simply looking at the menu but we knew what we wanted. She took it as we were still deciding and cut my friend off before she could even get a second word out and said \u201cI\u2019ll give you guys some time\u201d..she also did it again when we wanted to order dessert and cut my friend off, only this time she came back 10 min later, after checking all of her other tables around us.  There comes a point when you start to realize it\u2019s not just one waiter, or just you. I\u2019ve had negative experiences EVERY TIME. Will never give this place my business again.  P. S. - The best item on the menu for dinner in the Farm Burger, which is under seasoned. The also have the nerve to charge extra for cheese.",

The meat is massive an grilled where its crispy on the outside but tender on the inside.. cheddar cheese comes melted and the English muffin sounds weird for a burger but it\u2019s homemade and fantastic. For dessert we got the flourless cake which is probably purely dark chocolate pairing perfectly with the blueberry ice cream. Service was great too.

Its a nice place other than that, price can be down at least 2 dollars and should have special ideas for City Workers in general NOT just Teachers. There\u2019s a lot of people that work inside schools besides Teachers. Sadly other staffs that work - Dont get acknowledged- thats \ud83d\ude1e sad. Nice place if you have money to spend.",

The entire evening we took turns with the salt shaker, desperately trying to add some flavor to our extremely bland food. My husband got a burger which he said was mediocre at best. The most delicious thing I had was the bread. Service was slow, everything is over priced, and the staff was not very helpful when I had a question about the size of the plates.
