But the skinny girl with dark skin gave me an attitude when I ask for skim milk heated, she was very rude. And the the other girl didn't pay any attention to me when I ask a second time. She just roll her eyes and told me that she doesn't have any time for me. I make the line as many other customers but still didn't get the service. I was very upset for my first experience in this place. I pay my money to get service. I don't mind if I have to pay extra. If you don't have patience to work with people, just get another job. Customers service needs to improve ASAP!!! And it's a bakery, they were playing music with bad words. Isn't it supposed to be a nice place to enjoy food and relax??? I wanted to have break and I really want to enjoy the cosy place. I just turn around and leave",

GFG Bakery serves authentic Greek food like spanakopita (several varieties) as well as regular pastries like walnut cake. They also have both traditional Greek frappe and regular coffee. The cheese pie was made with Greek yogurt and was insanely rich practically had to be rolled out of the place. The first time I went, I was brought by a vegan friend. They have a large selection of vegan pastry. The vegan spanakopita is not as good as the regular spanakopita, but I still enjoyed it. The ambiance is clean and fresh, but be warned that there are only about 3 tables and you may have to take your food to go.\"",
