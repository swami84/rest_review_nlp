You can stand in line and wait forever if you're really adamant about trying it, but then you get stuck at an awful side table where they store the giant head cutouts of all the characters so you've got customers coming by you and grabbing them for pictures the entire time you're there. The food was absolutely awful and I ended up getting sick the same night and vomiting. The inside looked very similar to the show except 1/10th the size. Pretty much it would have been much more satisfying had I just checked the inside out for a couple minutes and then left. Definitely not worth the aggravation I went through to try it.",

I would definitely get them again. My friend had the brocollini and that was actually the best thing I ate!  For entrees, I ordered the Monte Cristo and it was good but didn't blow me away. It had a grainy mustard on it; which is something I'm not used to and while I didn't hate it, I also thought it overpowered the other flavors in the sandwich. My friend had the fried chicken and that was really good. It was extremely spicy; which I liked, but she didn't and she was surprised by it.  Dessert for me was lacking sadly. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing. I had the candied bacon and even though it was super delicious bacon, I guess I was expecting it to be something else. I've had brown sugar bacon, chocolate bacon and bacon brittle before so that's what I was anticipating. What I got was very good bacon with some carmely, sugared edges. Still good. My friend had the blueberry ice cream with the cone in it. Very good, but nothing out of this world.  This was my second time there and the first time I was really impressed by how good the drinks tasted. This time, the drinks were really really strong so that was impressive, but they were so strong all I tasted was alcohol. I know, seriously, I'm not complaining, just pointing out a fact.  Let's face it - I'd for sure come back. It's The Max!!! Late night is good enough for me though. I can skip the food next time. Glad I had a chance to try it.",

The job they did trying to model it after the Max from Saved by the Bell is great! We got a the table next to the door that Zach Morris would have walked through.  They have a themed cocktail menu with classic favorites with a few twists. Nothing crazy. The old fashioned was pretty good.  As part of the reservation we got an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. My girlfriend and I shared the AC Sliders and the Mac and Screech for our appetizers. The mac and cheese was ok but the AC Sliders were the real winner.  For the main course we shared the Bayside Burger and the Kelly Kewpowski which is a monte cristo. Both were very good. You get to choose a side and we had a biscuit from Bang Bang Pie which I know is an odd side but it was a killer biscuit.  For dessert we shared the candied bacon and the pie slice of the day from Bang Bang Pie which was a salted chocolate caramel. It was a wonderful combination.  I wouldn't say the food is next level but it's a nice approximation of what I think the kids would have had at the Max but then modernized. The real winner with Saved by the Max is the experience.

In addition to the near perfect recreation of the screen-used set (which makes up the bulk of the restaurant), a generous bar with three screens running episodes of Saved by the Bell, and additional niche seating areas recreating Mr. Belding's office or Miss Bliss's classroom make for a nostalgia thrill ride wherever you look.  As for the food, unless you food allergies or specific dietary restrictions, don't bother reading the full descriptions, just pick a title that sounds amusing or fun and enjoy. Every dish will be exquisite, and surpass expectations. As an example, my entree included a side of \"Mr. Belding's French Fries\". One does not ttpically expect much from french fries, yet these were seasoned beautifully and perfectly cooked with not a burnt end in the bunch. In more complicated dishes the chef truly shines as the sauces (whether for the biscuits and gravy, or enhancng the pulled pork of the AC Sliders) both delight and amaze.  In short, I could not be more excited about this restauarant and sincerely hope to secure another reaervation before their closing (currently planned for New Year's). Even if this became a permanently open restauarant, you would likely always need a reservation - both due to the limited seating, and the exquisite food that is sure to stay in high demand.",

I didn't have a reservation but arrived 20 min before opening and a line had already formed. Though the wait was about an hour it was worth it. There are tables and a lunch counter where you can sit and watch SBTB. While I was waiting for my meal a staff member started conversation with me, took pictures in the restaurant for me, and gave me SBTB trading cards. The food was great and reasonably priced. I will certainly try to go back before December!",

        "caption": "THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.  My boyfriend surprised me with tickets as an early anniversary surprise - aptly timed so we can swing through Chicago on our way home to Milwaukee from vacation. I was seriously excited and not at all disappointed, given my high expectations. Let me break it down for you.  The process: Yes, it's sold out. They MIGHT be able to get you in from the walk-in line, but don't count on it. When we arrived, staff came out to get our name, and those with reservations were called in and seated. We saw a few people from the line outside get seated at a table, but not many. It's a crap-shoot, but honestly, I'd try for it if I were you (see below). Because it's a FREAKING BLAST.  The atmosphere: So perfect, down to the last detail. Mr. Belding's Office, the jukebox, the payphone, the lockers, the music, the servers, the booths and tables...you feel like you're in the 90's again hanging with Kelly & Zack and the crew. If you loved SBTB at all, you're love it. If you're like me and REALLY loved SBTB, and still do...you can't miss this. The staff were upbeat and accommodating and offered to take tons of pics for us.  The food: Exceeded expectations! There's a good chef here, and it shows. Our favorite app was the Mac n' Screech (decadent, delicious), and we sampled the Kelly Kapowski and Tori's Fried Chicken for entrees and were pleasantly surprised by the flavor and uniqueness of both. The chicken has a KICK to it, and it was so interesting and yummy. We both got the Snack Attack for dessert (Twinkie ice cream, strawberry accent) and the flavor was so amazing it made we want to get up and do \"the Sprain.\" One of the best restaurant desserts I've had in a long time.  Can't forget, THE DRINKS: The cocktails have great names that only a true fan could love. I got the \"I'm So Excited\" and found it to be the perfect blend of sweet and tart. Could have sipped those for days. My boyfriend enjoyed the \"Last Dance,\" which was also delicious and summery. (On that note, what was with Kelly and Jeff? Seriously, girl, never date your boss, and you know you and Zack were meant to be so just realize it and move on.)  In summary, we left full, happy, a bit giddy from the nostalgia, and feeling like we definitely got our money's worth. It might be hard to get in, but it's worth it. Did Screech give up on asking out Lisa after he got denied the first time? Nope. (So neither should you, with Saved by the Max.)  GO BAYSIDE.",
