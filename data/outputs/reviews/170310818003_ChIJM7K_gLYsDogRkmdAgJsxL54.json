From the moment we walked in the staff was outrageously thoughtful and attentive to every detail. We decided to go all out for the evening with various cocktails, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I can say without question that each item exceeded our expectations, which were already fairly high. Rodrigo, our server, was very helpful in recommendations and wonderful conversation throughout the evening, adding a whole other element to our dinner. As this evening included not only COVID regulations but also a city-wide curfew there is no question that this was not the normal Saturday evening, but it was still one for the books for us. I can truthfully say we cannot stop discussing what an incredible meal, service, and atmosphere we experienced. Without a question will be returning for more, as well as recommending to anyone who will listen.",

They accommodated us within 10-15 minutes! Great Pomegranate Martinis by the way. They took my date to the table while I paid the bar tab. She told me they pulled her chair out, very respectful and classy. I ordered a salad and she had the soup. The Table-side made Caesar Salad was delicious, before my date could steal a bite to taste it, he set down a small bowl/portion for her to try. One server brings bread, another immediately behind him with the oil. One server brings the food, another immediately behind him with pepper and parmesan cheese.  Every Detail was great, never a low water glass, never waited for a server. Food Was AMAZING too. The Rigatoni and the Veal, but I wish I could have tried more, I'll be back.

Salmon Carpaccio, Ca del Bosco, Negroni, Linguini, pillows of love, Bronzino all prepared perfectly, and the Gaja Brunello di Montalcino was beyond.  The only thing that rivaled the food was the perfect service.  Humberto, thank you for the great experience.",

The gentlemen at the front desk were very quick to greet us and get us to a table. The server came over within seconds with water and menus.  Everything we had was delicious!! I especially enjoyed the Rigatoni Alla Buttera. The pasta was cooked a little past al dente but it still had a bite to it. It was firm enough that it held its shape and didn't taste mushy but not too hard either. The sauce was a creamy tomato sauce. I asked for it to be spicy which they did for me. The sausage was crumbles smaller than what I was expecting, it resembled ground beef.  Regardless of what it looked like it was so good. Seasoned well and not over cooked. Overall a great dish and a fairly good sized portion.  My husband got the Gnocchetti. He also enjoyed his dish. His portion was slightly smaller than mine but enough for him. He mentioned the gnocchi was a ginger lighter and more airy than what he's use too but he didn't mind it. The sauce was a simple tomato sauce.  One my favorite items was the item the chef sent over. It was like an adult grilled cheese. It was two pieces of thin focaccia with tomato, basil and melted cheese in the middle. I don't know if this is an item on the menu but they need to add it!  I didn't really care for the tiramisu. It wasn't bad but nothing to rave about either.  Overall great experience and awesome food! Will def be back to try some other thing :-)",

My favorite was the calamari that was lighly breaded paired with a light red sauce. For entrees we had quite a few but my top favorites were the Pappardelle Cinghiale that had tender wild boar. I will say the pasta was did taste homemade, but the sauce and boar made up for this. Another great dish was the Ravioli di Zucca. The combination of Pumpkin with and parmesan was well balanced.  Service- The waiter and staff were very attentive to our party of 7.  The only thing I will note here is the pace of service was on the slower side with the restaurant only 3/4 full on a Saturday night.  Overall good place for Italian food but there are better options.",

The fried zucchini flowers (3 pieces for $16) had water leaking out of them and the ravioli were undercooked and cold on the inside, which makes me think that they were not made fresh. The service was also rather pushy (we were asked several times if we wanted to buy more sparking water while we still had plenty left, and the server even brought an extra bottle to our table without asking). I'm giving 4 stars rather than the 3.5 I would award based on today's experience because I used to consider this a 4-5 star restaurant. I hope our experience is not representative of a general decline of quality, but I don't think I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

The bread was really yummy. We had a large group so the food did take a while but it was worth the wait. I had the Penne A la Arrabatia and it's become my favorite pasta. The pasta was cooked well and the spicy tomato sauce was perfect for my spicy leaning taste buds. Will definitely come back.",

This has been my fourth visit here in the past few years and I typically come here with good company because this is a European dining experience where you are expected to relax, be catered to and receive exquisite and authentic Italian dishes.  I strongly suggest you share an antipasto plate with a good friend because they have a huge selection of cheese, beans, asparagus, salami and other tempting traditional antipasti.   The polenta here is always a good choice as a sharable appetizer and by all means enjoy your favorite pasta dish because they are all made fresh from scratch here on the premises...never store bought.  I recommend the Gnocchetti which is a decadent buttery tasting pasta dumpling filled with Potato Gnocchetti, Tomato Sauce, and Buffalo Ricotta.  The gnocchi has always been my top pick because of the buttery richness.  You will also receive homemade breads and breadsticks here to accompany your meal and definitely don't forget to treat yourself to a decadent dessert !  This restaurant is perfect for a date, business meetings or good friends because you are never hurried here. Our server during our recent visit was Arturo, a wonderful conversationalist and extremely knowledgeable on all menu items.  He was definitely a seasoned professional and made sure we had everything we needed!  I'll be back next month!",

My family had accidentally looked at the opening times wrong and arrived 30 minutes prior to the restaurant being open. It was fairly chilly outside and we observed the marvelous atmosphere through the windows. Thankfully the staff was very kind and welcomed us inside. Once time had passed, more groups of people had came through and filled the empty spaces. Inside the restaurant was very spacious and had a cozy, rustic feeling. The staff had shown us great hospitality and offered us many delicious food options. My parents were also celebrating their 25th marriage anniversary, in which we were generously given delicious cookies. The food was absolutely spectacular! With high quality and excellent quantity everyone is guaranteed a full belly and a good time. The service was so outstandingly wonderful, it truly exceeded my expectations. Another thing I enjoyed were the beautiful thick blue drapes surrounding cut off points if someone reserved a part of the space for a private event (i.e family reunion). The drinks were also of great taste, for example I decided to be adventurous and go with the Blackberry Lemonade. What a great choice! With a mix of sweet and fruity which definitely satisfied my thirst. As for the desserts, the Tiramisu was a favorite. Topped with a single raspberry, this homemade treat was filled with wonderful layers of a sponge-like and absorbent texture. Graciously, we were also presented with a Compliment From The Chef which I thought was very kind (and delicious!) Overall we had a great experience and are forever thankful for the kindness presented to us, we would definitely love to come back.",

The food was excellent which I hate it to take away from the review. The helpers with water, bread, etc were fantastic. Our waiter however was another story.  This is my first review on here as I usually don\u2019t find the need but for this one I thought it was appropriate.  He comes and greets us as we tell him we are waiting for two more. The first 5 ordered drinks to start as I ordered a water and got a eye roll from him.  As we waited a little while for our guests to arrive we were trying to look over the menu and specials which he did not go over at all. He asked us and then when we said yes he literally just read them off the list with a bit of attitude. Not explaining but just reading word for word off the list.  When we agree on some appetizers he tells us that if we do not order something soon we will lose our table and we won\u2019t get any food. Again I understand we were waiting on two people for 15-20 minutes but we weren\u2019t just getting water and bread. We ordered appetizers and drinks. And it was such an attitude that we started to feel uncomfortable.  When the time came to order I ordered the ravioli but then saw the parpadelle and switched it literally the next second after I said ravioli. Upset that he had to scratch his order, he shook his head and rolled his eyes again.  He never came over and asked if how everything was tasting or if we needed anything.  For dessert he said you guys want the bill or dessert and took a big sign of relief when we said Bill.  I had money under my arms on the table waiting and without saying anything he proceeds to grab it from under my arm, count it in front of everyone, and says I will be back with change.  When he came to pick up the tip I did stop him and tell him how uncomfortable and unwelcome he made us feel. He got defensive and tried arguing.",

When we visited Chicago in May of this year we reviewed  some allergy friendly restaurants and decided to give Coco Pazzo a try. Earlier on in the day we did the same with a different Italian restaurant and my son had a severe allergic reaction and had to be medicated before he left the restaurant. So needless to say we were very cautious! We called the restaurant and we were asked all the right questions about my son's allergies which gave us a lot of confidence. When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted by the person who took our call and she assured us that everything is taken care of! The waiter at our table was also familiar with my son's allergies and was very welcoming! My son's food was very well presented and exactly what we had ordered. He was very excited when his dish arrived. My husband and I also had an amazing experience at the restaurant! We highly recommend the restaurant to any one with food allergies as they not only pay attention, they care! Keep up the good work guys! Susan, Roy and Luke",

I ordered the Polleto al Mattone and my wife ordered the Linguine alle Vongole. Both were very well prepared; the chicken and clams were cooked to perfection, and the sauces tied the vegetables into the dish wonderfully.  We were given an amouse-bouche by the chef, a bite of focaccia with fontina and sweet peppers, which was delicious. We're also given a pistachio macaroon, compliments of the pastry chef.  Our server, Victor, was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable of the menu and each dish.  He was prompt with everything and when we were finished talked with us about cats and molecular gastronomy.  Dessert was perfect, we had the tiramisu and the flourless chocolate cake, and I subbed the standard cappuccino gelato for the huckleberry gelato they had as a special.  It's not often that we spend $100 dollars on dinner (including a bottle of wine) and feel that it was completely worth every penny!  I recommend getting there close to 5p, it gets very busy after 6p on the weekends.",

We didn't anticipate people arriving an hour early to the restaurant.  We were so impressed with Coco Pazzo that instead of having the door locked, people were welcomed inside and served drinks by the staff.  There was valet parking and the restaurant even took care of having a dance floor installed for the evening.  A string quartet performed during the cocktail hour and through dinner and after dinner there was a DJ tucked away in a little corner.  From the very beginning we worked with Christina at Coco Pazzo and she made the planning and the whole process easy.  She ended up being like a wedding planner and took so much of the stress off of myself and the bride.  She was on top of things and put together the most perfect wedding for us.  We could not have been happier with the outcome.  A local florist from Indiana decorated the restaurant with flowers and my daughter's decorations were put around beautifully.  The food and wine tasting at Coco Pazzo was a wonderful experience and Chef Federico came up with a fabulous menu.  Unfortunately the groom was not able to attend the tasting so the bride brought mom and dad along.  The Chef overwhelmed us with appetizers, antipasti, main courses and desserts.  Everything was absolutely delicious and we were full before the main courses arrived.  The quality of the food and service here was impeccable and the staff went out of their way to make sure everything was as the bride and groom expected.  Guests were served mouth watering appetizers and drinks during the cocktail hour.  After the beautiful ceremony in the restaurant guests took their seats to enjoy a wonderful multi course meal.  Roberto, the General Manager, was very accommodating and helped to make sure that everything ran smoothly along with Christina.  He was also instrumental in the excellent selection of wines for the evening.  The waiters, waitresses and bartenders all did a fantastic job the entire evening.  There was nothing we would do differently.  Guests bragged for weeks afterwards about the fabulous meal and time they had at the wedding!  I had guests tell me the wait staff made them feel \"special.\"  The evening was spectacular!  Wonderful Chef, wonderful staff, wonderful food, wonderful service..........",

Started with the anti pasta which was fair, would not order it again.  It did have cold asparagus and broccoli which was new to me and over cooked mushrooms.  We were sitting without any food for about 10-15 minutes.  Our reservations were 9:30 and we were one of the last tables, so it was not busy.  My pasta came with a white wine thyme sauce, when it finally arrived, it was a lite red color.  My noodles were paper thin, which is not proper for pappardelle, and over cooked.  After a few bites I found a bone, ignored it then continues.  After eating les than half my pasta I had probably 8 bones on my plate. My boyfriends gnocchi   was also overcooked.  B.ut we waited so long for our food, we didn't want to say anything.  When I told the server that my past was all bones, his response was, \"Ya, that happens with rabbit.\"  I was a manager in a restaurant and currently a server.  If rabbit is cooked properly, it should never happen.  He never apologized or anything.  He then paced our table at the end of the evening waiting for us to sign the check, since we were his last table.  For what you pay, and all the competition in Chicago I expected more.  I would not recommend going back.  My chefs have now said they will cook me my pasta for me",
