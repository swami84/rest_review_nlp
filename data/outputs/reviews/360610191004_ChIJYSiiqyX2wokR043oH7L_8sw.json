They still make their sandwiches in the round pitas instead of the ever trendy wraps that you find these days. They drop the falafel in the fryer after I place my order so I know it's fresh every time. It's a small place so I wouldn't plan to.wat here if you're with a group but carry our is done so well that your order will hold up until you can sink your teeth into it.

I have been frequenting this restaurant for nearly 25 years, and while falafels are undoubtedly better in Amsterdam, the ones here are pretty darn good. Baba ghanoush and hummus also delicious. I had a very bad experience late one night and food was not delivered. However, I went in the next day to complain and not only was I greeted warmly as a long-time customer, but I was given a heartfelt apology and a reasonable explanation, as well as a good plan for such a kerfuffle not to happen again ( and it hasn\u2019t). I also got a free meal for myself and a friend and a warm invite to return ( and I have\u2014many times yummmmmmm). This is one of my all-time fave neighborhood spots. Yes I was let down once but every single other experience at Jerusalem restaurant has been stupendous. A real winner.",

They were about to re-heat a baklava for me in the microwave but I told them to forget it, I couldn't believe that's how they re-heat. The falafel and shwarma was good though and the veggies were fresh enough. Overall, the epitome of a 3 star restaurant, but if you're in the area and want middle eastern, it will do.",
