Our first sign should have been that it was the only restaurant downtown that was not completely booked up. The second sign should have been the decor and atmosphere... and the third sign should have been the water glasses with some yummy crunchy pieces on the outside of the cups. I ordered the ahi tuna steak... and I can tell you last night I woke up and almost threw up multiple times. I would also like to add: the seasonal veggie was brocolli (very exciting...) and I have had better seasoned food in a hospital. I cringe at the fact that we spent $60+ for 2 people (that was 1 drink and 1 entree per person) for a meal that was so lack luster and bland.  Normally I would not write this review and would just let it go... but the fact that I got sick from the food in the middle of the night was the deciding factor for me. 10/10 would NOT recommend.",

It was average not melt in your mouth steak. Should have went with the seafood. They have a phenomenal shrimp side. It was excellent! Company party that my owner paid for but I also own my own businesses and take clients out to eat so I am always on the look out for new places to treat clients but might or might not come back because of the lack of attention. It wasnt horrible service but wasn't great either. A lot of us had to rush to get our orders in. It was snowing and traffic was bad. It took awhile so the servers rushed me to choose what to eat. I might try it on my own next time on a date or client meeting but will try the seafood next time. Overall not bad but not the greatest. Ruth's Chris, Bouse Le Coq's in Eagle Lock Stock and barrel in Bouse and Indian Creek Steak House in Caldwell are my favorites for steak restaurants.",

Their menu includes more standard options, such as salmon and cheese on a bed of greens, and ranging to a spicy tuna bowl with sweet mango and savory ahi. They are a good choice for large groups, and with reservations, can support groups of 20 or more. Their wait staff is pleasant, polite and jovial.",

For our meals, we ordered the same dish - shrimp and scallops sauteed in soy sauce and served on rice noodles.  Delicious!

We ordered two drinks & a calamari appetizer, The Mule tasted like pure syrup and we asked to switch it for a beer. She was happy to do so and soon after we got our appetizer, the calamari had good flavor however some pieces were rubbery. When we got our entrees the side of rice and au gratin potatoes tasted as if they were made hours ago, hard and stale. The 3 jumbo shrimp that came with the steak were dry and rubbery. We spoke to the manager and she took one drink off of our bill and gave us a coupon for a BOGO appetizer. We were not looking to get our meal comped however we still ended up paying $85 for a meal that was extremely disappointing with only one drink being taken off. We will not be returning in the future.",

Trout was a little over- cooked, but the salmon, fish and chips, rice bowl, and scallop dip appetizer were excellent, so perhaps the trout was a fluke. Regardless, Bonefish is a very good restaurant in a fabulous location.  Tables have a sheet of paper on them for coloring, as well as a children's menu, so it's a kid friendly place.  If you're there in the summer, be sure to sit outside on the patio.",

The obvious swirl of an empty glass right in her line of sight wouldn't do the trick. Food was also displeasing, unfortunately, as I really wanted to like it. Avacado was rotten in 2 of the 3 meals (as avacado was absent in the 3rd) potatoes undercooked, and desert was drenched in syrup. I am giving them 2 stars as the tuna and steak was actually delectable",

I've eaten several times at bonefish grill for their excellent bang bang shrimp and I go back every time for that and their delicious lobster bisque.  The issue; my husband has a certified and trained service dog, she is quiet and does her job and most time waitresses don't even know we have her till way into the meal, that's how good she is. But every time we go into bonefish the hostesses tell us we have to go outside to eat with our dog. The last time we went, she was pushy about us needing to eat outside even though we told her that the dog is a service dog and we wanted to eat inside because it was getting dark and it was getting very cold outside and they didn't have the heaters on; she finally listened after the group behind us started making comments about her behavior and so they put us in the back and out of sight; but to our benefit, it was quiet.  Other than the rude hostess, the waitress was great, filling our drinks without bothering us and checking up on us all the time, she was fabulous and the food was on par.  I highly recommend this place for a great fine dining experience and for tasty seafood.  Maybe just skip the hostess or don't be disabled lol",

It really stuck out to me what a well oiled machine they were. The appetizers were delicious and reasonably priced. The manager on duty, I think his name is Judah, brought my brother out to visit with us while we were there. He then excused himself to go personally check on every single table, circling back to us when we were finishing up. He spent a good 10 minutes chatting with us, which made the whole experience feel even more personable.  The food was A+ and the people working there are like a family. Such an amazing, cozy, and friendly place for a quiet Thursday evening. I can't wait to visit again.",

We decided to try the bar and after not receiving service for an unexplained amount of time we decided to close our tabs and move on.. I don\u2019t review much, but when you have an experience as bad as this, with people who genuinely don\u2019t care about your experience, it\u2019s justified to let everyone know!

The service during our visit was good, not too many visits to the table by our server to be disruptive or too few to be irritating. Need that water glass filled more than once? Got it covered.  The wine by the glass is reasonably priced and the menu offers a good number of choices. Likewise, the dinner menu itself offers a good array of choices; I chose the Chilean Sea Bass with Jasmine rice for my entree. The fish was perfectly cooked and the rice was neither dry or too sticky; great flavor for both. If you don\u2019t like food that used to swim, they have a nice filet mignon for you.  Based on my experience visiting this restaurant, I would definitely go back.",
