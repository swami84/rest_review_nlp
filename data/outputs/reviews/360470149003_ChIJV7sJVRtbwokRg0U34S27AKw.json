For $7.99, you could purchase a nice-sized sub with a menu that offers two dozen various Boar's Head meats and cheeses.  Thrown into the deal was a can of soda and bag of chips.  I thought that this was a great deal.  The guy who ran the business was very friendly and showed me a selection of many wet toppings that could be added to my sandwich including pickles, jalapenos, tomato slices, lettuce, and several other options.  The worker didn't just do his job, he actually made recommendations on what he offered.  You could tell that he loved working there.  I'm assuming that he's either the owner or a very dedicated employee.  The hero bread was soft and tasted fresh.  And of course the meat on my hero was Boar's Head, so we already know the quality there.  What made this place stand out was a large selection of candy packages that appeared to be Japanese imports. These candies, along with a display showing an assortment of anime toys on a nearby shelf, added color and playfulness to the store's ambiance.  Overall, the place was clean, presentable, and due to the worker's (owner's?) friendliness, had a great vibe to it.  I usually visit Park Slope to eat at restaurants, but this place will now be on my radar when I'm in the mood for a sub made at a mom and pop place instead of from a national chain.",

        "caption": "Remarkably good and inexpensive. Got a chicken parm hero for 6 bucks. It was quite good, I\u2019d argue as good or better than one from a pizza place that would generally cost 50 percent more. Also, the owner/proprietor is quite charming, a Hawaiian expat and a couple playful Hawaiian items found their way to the menu. There\u2019s also cool Chinese and Japanese snacks and ice cream, all at prices that are surprisingly affordable for the south slope. I\u2019ll definitely be back.",
