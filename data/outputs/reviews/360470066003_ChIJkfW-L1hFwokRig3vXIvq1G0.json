Since we discovered Anthony's, I've stopped giving him a hard time when he suggests sausages for dinner.  Also try their Primo Italiano sub. Yum.  Edit: Actually, try The Italiano. Even better!  It's hard to find a butcher (especially in Brooklyn!) that is always friendly and positive, who answers the phone when slammed, and who takes the time/has the patience to give you exactly what you needed (for a weird recipe you've never made before).",

Decent burger, sausage, and pre cooked selections if you're into that. Got a few rib eye steaks, good quality, but as mentioned, pricey. Wouldn't go out of my way to go here.",
