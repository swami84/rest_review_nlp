        "caption": "Let me start off by saying I have purchased breakfast, lunch and dinner from this establishment multiple times a week (spent lots of money here and so have my coworkers). Not to mention I was made aware of the food at this restaurant via word of mouth and encouraged others to purchase food here as well. When frequenting this restaurant, I would mainly purchase the salmon Caesar salad. Today, I purchased a salmon caesar salad with caesar dressing only to notice after I had ingested some dressing that was molded and lumpy (1st issue). I returned the dressing along with my receipt and explained what happened. The owner was not there but the next person in charge said he would just give me a new dressing. So I asked, \"Is there no concern that I have ingested molded dressing?\". They guy said \"yes that\u2019s why I gave you a new dressing\". I said no I would like my money back and he told me in order to get my money back I needed to return the rest of the salad (2nd issue). I was appalled that he asked for the salad back. When your company has messed up, you should provide the upmost customer service... but I guess their tight on the dollar. I bring the salad back and request my refund. The little nasty lady that's always taking orders tells me that she's refunding my card and I said no I would like the cash. Mind you they have refunded me with cash in the past. The nasty lady then says she had to call the owner first, so I said call her. I would like to speak to her since she knows me very well from always purchasing food here. They owner says she does not want to speak to me (poor customer service) and it was the last time they would accommodate me. I told them do not worry I won't be back, obtained my refund and told everyone in line that they gave me molded salad dressing and piss poor customer service. While the food here is pretty good, I refuse to support an establishment which lacks customer service skills especially when they are in the wrong. I WILL NOT return here! This should speak volumes regarding their customer service.",
