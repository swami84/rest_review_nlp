We finally made it after the restaurant indoor dining reopening.  Wow did it meet our expectations. The fish was amazing, each bite a wonderful balance of flavors - if forced to pick favorites would be a tie between Sea Bass and the Chutoro but each bite was truly special. The non-nigiri dishes were also fantastic: amazingly delicate miso soup, delicious black cod and and fabulous panna cotta to wrap it up. We added Aji (chef\u2019s recommendation) and Wagyu (because...Wagyu) to the tasting menu and would recommend both. Didn\u2019t try it but saw an order of the foie gras plated and were immediately envious!  The experience is faster than originally envisioned. Tough to give the full artistry and adhere to the 90 minute regulation. They did an excellent job balancing speed with presentation - only miss out on watching exquisite knife work.  We will definitely go back!",

We indicated that one of us were not feeling well and the person making reservation ONE MONTH agao, only got a reminder text 1.5 hour before the cancellation deadline but was only able to call after busy workday, thus missing an hour into the 48 hour policy. All they said was we can't give exception to everyone because already many people are cancelling. And they were like: \"If you can't make it because of unexpected situation, it is *YOUR RESPONSIBILITY* to find other customers to come and dine in instead.\" This is ridiculous and reflects poorly on the core value of this restaurants and how they treat their customers.  So OMAKSA YUME, either you do what you claim in your reply below consistently or you ADMIT that there is a mistake when you handled our call.  As a responsible person, let me give you some suggestions: 1. Have a better understanding that people have job and they don't work like restaurants hours where you can check text every minute during a work day. 2. Go have your reservation app send out reminder texts at least one day ahead of your deadline like all other restaurant does, and then you have a better ground to ask people to \"notify\" you as soon as possible when their plans change. 3. When you have chance to provide good customer service, DO IT RIGHT THEN, don't come back and try to sugar coat with lies to fix the situation because you are worried that an angry review might make you look bad.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Had a reservation made 1 month ago and we wanted to cancel our reservation due to the current pandemic situation. But they insist on charging the cancellation fee even though it has only been 1 hour into the 48 hour policy. Things move so rapidly recently, and many people are gett anxious, even banks are giving grace periods to loans and stuf.. But it seems like all this business cared about, is getting their money. They were like \"we can not give exception to everyone\", well what kind of exception have you given then? For the short term, yes it will let you make that free money but you are losing many long term businesses. Shame on this business and the owner. I wish you guys go out of business soon and more local and smaller business can get your customers eventually.",

Most of the fish is already precut and the pieces are pretty small so you have to savor each bite. The rice is okay. I wanted to ask for a little more wasabi on my pieces, but it felt awkward to ask since preparation/making the sushi felt like mass producing for everyone at once rather than an individual piece catered to you. Overall, I think it's worth trying at least once, but I'd rather go to other omakases.",

While you have some staples like the sake (salmon) and tuna 3 ways, all of which are amazing, you can tell that the Chef is constantly trying to innovate and try new things with the rest of the menu. They also always have seasonal and rare fish in the Specials section which you can order a la carte as add-ons. We came here for my boyfriend's birthday and they were so kind and genuine, making it truly special. My favorites were the tuna 3 ways, the salmon, the kanpachi, the wagyu (special), and the miso cod, but everything was amazing. Will definitely be coming back soon.

For the food, everything was exceptional. We added on a few specials including the Uni, Ikura, Foie Gras,  Wagyu, and Hotaru Ika. The Uni and Wagyu were my favorite specials out of the ones that we decided to try. As far as the omakase that is included in the $125 my favorite bites were the Akami, Otoro, and Sake but everything overall was delicious and the presentation of the fish was nice.  There is something that this place lacked and it was warmth. The entire meal is very quiet. I think it would be helpful if the chef introduced himself and asked the customers if this was their first time dining at Omakase Yume. I think this would help make it feel like a more welcoming environment. Some soft music in the background might be helpful too.  All in with tip, specials, and omakase we were in about $600 for the two of us. I think with that price some of the specials should be included in the $125/omakase.",

The chef was mostly focused on making sushi but he kindly answered any questions we had about the food such as the origin of the fish and the techniques he was applying to the dish. The hosts were amazing! They were all attentative and quick to answer any of our concerns. In fact, my table next to me brought two different types of sake and the host was able to recommend one of them for better harmony with the upcoming dishes. The hosts were very respectful and refilled our drinks throughout the course meal. We would occasionally make little talks with them and we could tell they were knowledgeable about the sushis.  As for the food, it was absolutely amazing.  As a person who visits Korea and Japan yearly, I must say the sushis here are top notch. I could tell all the fishes were extremly fresh. In fact, I did not expect to find high quality fishes such as kinmedai. The sake, chutoro, and kanpachi was exceptionally good! Chutoro had just the rght amount of fat which enhanced the flavor of the tuna and its unique texture when biting into it.  Ive been to many japaneses restuarants around the city and I must say this place is the best in Chicago. You could tell the chef truly creates authentic japanese cruisine. When you eat the sushi, it is a bit warm due to the fresh made rice but that is how sushi actually should be. The sushis from some other resturants come out cold and you could tell that the sushis were pre-made. I hoenstly did not expect the sushis here to taste so similar to the ones in Korea/Japan with its taste, freshness, texture, and even the atmosphere. If you want to try authentic sushi as if you're in East Asia, I would 100% recommend this place.  p.s. Get the wagyu sushi when its time for special order. It will blow your tastebuds.",

I had a few issues but bottom line the fish at such a dinner needs to be the freshest possible.  At my dinner *all* the fish tasted fishy and not in a good way.  It was warm and flaccid like it had been sitting in a warm kitchen for too long.  Imagine you let fresh cut fish sit on your kitchen counter for a few hours...it was like that and really unpleasant.  At these prices one expects nothing less than perfection.  This was not even close.",

I've never paid much attention to him until he opened up in Niles. I tried it out and was a fan, when I heard he opened up an 8 seat omakase restaurant, I wanted to see how it'd be. To my surprise, it was delightfully a lot better than I had hoped for. The fish were fresh, you can tell by how tight the meat was. Everything was very flavorful, I can't say that anything was bad. Only two things didn't jump out at me and that's just me though: Miso Soup (for obvious reasons) and the Ika (squid). I'm not saying the Ika was bad, just saying it could've been enhanced with some other flavorings. I'd give this place a try before it gets overly popular and you're waiting weeks out before getting a reservation. They've been open for barely 10 days and I had to make a reservation 2 weeks out already.",
