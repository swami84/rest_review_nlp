The Thai did not have any flavor and there was way less vegetables than the last time. The Kao Soi came with chicken even after I've paid $2 more and it was not good (watery curry, no season, and the noodle taste like instant noodles), and even the Thai roll was not good (we could barely taste any shrimp!) I'm not sure what happened tonight - maybe they changed the chef, but I like to have consistency when ordering food! Also it's not cheap ($50 for an appetizer and 2 dishes which is a lot for a Thai restaurant in Chicago). Not planning in come back at this place and wouldn't recommend...",

Today I had ordered \u201cThe Boat noodle soup \u201caka- Thai Pho\u201d it was Wow!! moreover than that there was a Dry Chili powder (looks alike a cayenne peppers) as an option on the side for who loves real Thai spicy. This chili has made in house by owner. Lastly, I have to thanks for the humbleness of the thai owner who came checking the foods and services and brought us a Mango with the sweet sticky rice which his chef made on the house. I was really surprised with all these outcomes  and great experiences. I walked passing by this place a million times and never cared to check it out because of I judged the book by the cover\ud83d\ude15 I didn\u2019t wait to order some more back home for my husband to try them including the dessert that I just tried. Recommend to try this real Thai food!  \u0e02\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e19\u0e30\u0e04\u0e48\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e15\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e14\u0e35",
