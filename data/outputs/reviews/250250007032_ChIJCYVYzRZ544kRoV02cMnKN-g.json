They checked our temperature and seated us.  The food AND the service were both phenomenal! The lamb skewers, wagyu and chicken were so flavorful. The skewer hot pot was HUGE and so delicious.  The noodles are bomb af too. The instant noodle is the best noodles I've had in a while and the Dan Dan Noodle was the perfect amount of cold and refreshing and spicy!  We ordered take out last night too because it was so good. The 30 small skewer deal was so fantastic. Also try the Garlic Eggplant and their veggie skewers are also so perfect. The delivery bag came with a safety card that said who prepared your meal and their temperature!  Amazing food! Definitely gonna order again so soon.",

The food is delicious and so flavorful, even if you aren't familiar with the specific cuisine. They have delicious vegetarian and meat options. Their delivery was quick, very yummy, and included a \"delivery food safety chart\" that specified the name and body temp of the employees who prepared and packaged your food.",
