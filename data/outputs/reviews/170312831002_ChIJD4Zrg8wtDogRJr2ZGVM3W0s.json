The shawarma was extremely juicy and delicious, the spices were adequately made with the meat. The falafel was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The hummus was smooth and tasty, and the bread is super fresh and smelt so good too! The rice was well seasoned and was cooked perfectly. The service was immaculate, I could tell many people become like family here because they will return again including me. I was treated so kind and they offered so many sides to make my experience full. I also noticed they treat everyone the same, so everyone is happy.

First of all, I want to start by saying that I have a lot of sympathy and understanding towards workers in the food industry and I know how hard it is to work in a restaurant all day long. However, we are in the middle of a pandemic and preparing sandwiches without gloves and your mask not covering your nose is worrying. Even more worrying is when we get in the car and the chicken shawarma sandwich literally has visibly undercooked chicken. Aside from these two huge issues the falafel was not good and the sauces were even worse. I wouldn\u2019t have left a review under normal circumstances but the no gloves and undercooked chicken were beyond alarming. Stay away.",

For example a lamb shank (about $15) comes with an entire bone-in lamb shank with a bed of rice, a salad, a soup, pickeled cabbage, and bread. These meals are perfect for those long days or when you have to work late. Another thing we like is the variety of menu options there. I like the lentil soup with the chicken schwarma but my friends love the eggplant or okra with the beef kabobs and lamb shank. There is something there that we all like and is now our go to for lunch.",

You could tell made it daily.  Fresh, garlicky and pungent.  A nice way to start the meal. We ordered the 3 meat plate (shawarma, Kefta and shish kabob) which was a full meal with lentil soup  (great depth of flavor, warm and inviting) side salad which was ok (I apparently needed to add some acid) and then the meats an fill rice, they were out of the yellow rice (bummer).

They recommended the lentil soup which redefined of what I thought lentil soup supposed to be OMG deliciousness.
