The lomein was for my 3 year old since she loves spaghetti , why not lomein right???  Anyways the beef fried rice was otherworldly terrible. The \"beef\" was long ugly cuts of greyish beef fat and gristle. I chucked it in the trash upon further inspection. There was no real cuts of beef to be found, it was pretty much inedible. The lomein was ok, nothing to write home about. Im done with this spot. Go to King Dragon instead, laziness is the only reason I came here. King Dragon is the best Chinese Food place in the area. I really should of went there instead. Avoid this place unless you're a food masochist.",

        "caption": "So I have been coming for years since I'm in the neighborhood but tonight was just a shock. My husband is white. They sat us down and proceeded to ignore us. I motioned for someone to take our order three times. The sullen faced male walked away and didn't bother to take out a pad and proceeded to wait on customers who came in after us. He motioned for a female to write down the order. When the order finally arrived they put mine in front of my husband and vice versa. I asked the waiter to switch it around. He walked away so I had to lift two boiled bowls of noodles with my hands and burned my thumbs.  I would note the place wasn't busy and we were the only mixed race couple in the place and all the waiters were rude to us.  First thing Tues we are marching to the human rights commission. Sad in this day and age a restaurant in Flushing would still do this to mixed race couples. No matter how good the food the service is unacceptable.",
