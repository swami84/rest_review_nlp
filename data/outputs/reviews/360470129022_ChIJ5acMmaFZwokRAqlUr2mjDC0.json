They also did not enforce wear a mask when up from the table or check temperatures. We eventually got seated and our server Marlon was very nice and accommodating. Even though I order a starter as my entree and make sure to state that my food came out well before my party\u2019s. It then took 15 minutes for my sister to receive her food. We waited 15 more minutes for my mother\u2019s food and when we asked when it would be out we were told it would take 15-20 minutes more. Marlon however tried his best to make it a better situation. He offered found a table for us, offered us a free appetizer, and even took the entree that never arrived off our bill. I will also mention that despite having a song saying they were limiting seating time because of the current pandemic they are not. They\u2019re was a party that was there well before us and at the same time we had. Overall my family will not be coming here again, which is very unfortunate. They only get two stars because of Marlon",

I\u2019m totally surprised because I never had an issue with you guys. Maybe because it was a lot of people, btw I waited nearly an hour to receive my food however that\u2019s no issue; just wished my food was properly seasoned. You guys missed the mark this time. Lastly I will be returning to give another try because the atmosphere is always good, drinks are great (try the Sorrel or Passionfruit juice) and I never had an issue with the food until now.",

Thankfully I was able to look at some pictures of their meals and determined I\u2019d be able to find something I\u2019d like. The establishment is a nice size with a bar in the front and dining towards the back and sides. It doesn\u2019t feel tight and the ambience is chill, the clientele friendly. The background music wasn\u2019t loud and I couldn\u2019t even tell you what was playing. The seating space was adequate and the chairs were comfortable. I started with a rum punch which I had red was delicious and they didn\u2019t disappoint and it was a full glass serving. Now let\u2019s get to the food..... Let me tell you Google how surprisingly delicious my food was! Omg! I called the server over to rave about my meal while my friend explained how much  of a picky eater I am. I ordered the Jambalasi Shrimp w/ Chandon-Bennie Garlic Butter with a side of rice and peas and steamed cabbage. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in that sauce but I\u2019m going back and I\u2019m taking my husband! He\u2019s a huge Caribbean foodie and I need him to experience their food. Now I know there\u2019s more offerings on the menu but when a restaurant has you at the first meal a lot needs to be said. The shrimp were tender and on the large side. That sauce was so good I had my friend taste some and she was equally impressed. My rice was perfect, as was my shredded steamed cabbage. My friends oxtails looked like they were made with love and please know I don\u2019t give that compliment lightly. You know the chef(s) in that kitchen take a lot of pride and put much care into their food. It wasn\u2019t salty at all, everything was flavorful and spoke to my soul. Can you hear my joy Google? Lol. The ONLY downside was when I went to pay they didn\u2019t accept Discover and that was the only cc I had on me and it was NOT a pay week \ud83d\ude12 so a sister was running on fumes. Thankfully my friend was able to cover my meal for me.",

As we navigated our way through the crowd and showed the security our email with respect to our reservation, He responded; there is a private Kwanzaa event here, as such it is impossible for you to be given a reservation for tonight.

The hostess was all over the place. Inattentive when trying to inquire about a table for 2. She told us it would be a 30 min wait. We agreed to wait. My bf had to ASK HER to take down his name & number. Why should we tell her how to do her job? We hung out next door & never received a phone call. We decided to call back & see if our table was ready. She blatantly LIED & said she called us for 15 minutes straight & gave our table away. If someone calls u & for some strange reason doesn't get through, wouldn't the smart thing to do is to leave a message?! The place doesn't even look appealing anymore anyway. They're rude and they stare at you when you walk in the door. No customer service skills at all! It's so sad to see a nice place go down for no reason.",

They have a great happy hour deal at the bar and their jerk wings and oxtails are legendary as well as their sorrel drinks.  Most of their food is good if not a little overpriced.  The music is great and the place is small but it doesn't stop people from dancing in their respective areas.  The glass doors by the bar are usually open allowing the crowd to spill out on to the sidewalk for extra space or a quick smoke. The floors to bathroom downstairs are kind of slippery so be careful if you're wearing slippery shoes.  Also I'm not sure why but there's a women's restroom with 2 toilets, like put up a wall please cuz nobody's sharing.",

The manager of a restaurant would never talk to paying repeat customers in the fashion that this young man did. Who does that? Then he kept telling me God bless you and have a good day.  Telling customers who ordered food and we're trying to get to the bar that they need to do it the right way and make a reservation is beyond the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Being smart and being rude is uncalled for.  Because i was a woman. He was rude and disrespectful . He didnt speak to men in sucu a rude manner.  As someone who has been to this restaurant many times, i was flooted by the behavior of this young man.  How do speak to customers 101 should be his firsr class.  His attitude was diplorable. The young man should have said im sorry ma'am we have no room. The bar shouldnt have taken your order without knowing where you were seated. I apologize. And that eould have been it. Instead he tell is DO IT THE RIGHT WAY NEXT TIME.  As a black west indian person. I will never spend my money here again and and i suggest other black people follow suit. The young lady who was bartender was very nice. God bless her. This is why blacl establishments fail because of customer service. I can go to a white established wirh horrible food and will continue to go back because the customer service is bad.  Stop treating black people who look like you and women with disrespect.",

We were told that the wait would be one hour and the staff took our name down. However , there were ten other groups on the name list that came after us , and were seated before us. Note that the names of these groups were listed below my name, meaning that it could not have been the case that they had made reservations before me. These groups were of the same size as my party as well, if not bigger.  At the one hour 20 min mark, we were told we would be next, but yet that was not the case. And at the one hour 40 min mark , we were told we had to wait yet another 20 minutes for a table. That\u2019s when we realised we were effectively never getting a table. We then asked if we could just eat around the bar area and were told we could not, yet there were others munching away at the bar.  There was no effort made by the staff to communicate with us throughout this whole time, I had to approach the staff repeatedly to get updates. Very disappointed by the service. Do not come here if you are not a regular who knows the staff. Your business will not be valued and you will be passed over.",

Once my friend arrived we were seated right away although I was told there was about a 30 minute wait. 15 is excellent!!! Once we were seated no one came to even give us water. We waited maybe 15 and then flagged down on of the servers who assisted us. I had the fish tacos. Very good and I probably could have had as an entree because it was filling. My main course was the salmon with tamarind sauce. Pretty good. Then server checked on us once until we asked for our check. Music was good as usual.",

There is another restaurant with the same name( sugarcane raw bar) 1.8 miles away. We ended up there paid $18 for half an hour parking. Walked to the restaurant sat down since we made reservations and left for the correct place when we saw the menu. There was no oxtail but it was great ambiance. Had to pay another $26 for parking.

What I cannot understand for the life of me is that bathroom situation. What the hell is with these 2 stalls in one bathroom, separated by nothing? I don't want to see another woman use the bathroom next to me, I don't want to see any sanitary anything, so most women, like myself go in and lock the door while there are others waiting to use it.  Build an enclosure for each stall for crying out loud, and please fix them. They're old and beaten down, looking very ugly and unkempt. The sink is too small, so when you wash your hands, water spills all over, there is no paper towel holder, so they are placed on the counter right next to the small sink, disgusting, and the top ones are always wet...disgusting again! They need a paper towel dispenser like yesterday! They need to fix and separate those stalls like immediately, if not sooner!!!!!!!!",

I must say, my first time was pretty good!  HANDS DOWN, the food was onnnn pointtt. I ordered the Rasta Pasta with chicken, which was like $16, and let me tell y'all...I was pleasantly surprised to see how much food was brought out on that plate! I don't play, I like to eat, and I finished my whole plate, which astonished my friend. For $16, I got a LOT of food, and it was very delicious. I also got a Sorrel Sangria type drink, and it was tasty. It didn't taste like much at first, but the drink creeps up on you a bit!  On the wait time: this is the part that requires patience. As I said, everytime I walk past here, it is packed (which I now know is for good reason), but that waiting time is serious business. I got there with three small groups of folks ahead of me and waited an hour. My friend and I bided time in Bleachers next door and weren't starving, so there was no big fuss from us. But my understanding from one of the folks ahead of us is that even with a reservation, the waiting time is still extensive. We had the hostess call us when a table was ready, which is at least considerate of honoring our wanting to patron there, but my ultimate hope is that Sugarcane may opt for a bigger space in the future. They have good business, and it'd surely be better for its customers!",

As it being \"Cinco de Mayo\", I decided to go out for something to eat and possibly something to drink. I chose this restaurant because I've always left satisfied, until tonight that is. I sat at the bar as I usually do and patiently waited for someone to take my order. Next thing I knew there was someone tapping me on the shoulder asking me to leave. I informed them that I didn't get a chance to order and someone else uttered that I came in when they were closed. I felt completely insulted. I was denied food then asked to leave. From one business person to another, I'm pretty sure that's not how you'd like your establishment viewed. I hope you'll be able to resolve this issue. Thanks!",
