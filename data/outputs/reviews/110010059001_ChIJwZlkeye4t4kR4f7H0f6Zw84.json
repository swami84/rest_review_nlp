The meal itself was outstanding - thoughtfully composed with just the right portioning for one, which was hard to find for this unique covid-19 Thanksgiving! In addition to the food being excellent, I have to also commend the restaurant's embrace of the delivery business model. It was a flawless experience to order on Tock, and although I was concerned about the Postmates delivery because it was a third party, that part was also flawless. The packaging insured that everything arrived intact and it was all well labeled with preparation instructions for reheating.It is important to support our local businesses through delivery and carry out during this time, and I'm genuinely happy to accept some bumps in the road with businesses that typically are optimized to operate in person as they adapt to online operations, but I am happy to say that none of those bumps existed here! I will certainly be placing subsequent orders and make it a point to visit in person once it is safer to do so!",

The constant bar noise -- empty bottles tossed in the trash repeatedly -- was a real mood killer.  My tablemates were even less impressed than I have was.  But I have to say that when no fewer than five employees cut in front of me when was being seated? The manners of the staff should have been my clue that this wasn't going to end well.

My dinner was great - the French onion soup was thick and oozing (quite literally) with flavor.  The Beef Short Rib Bourguignon was small, but filling, flavorful and well-presented. I'd warn you about the skin and flabby pieces on the bottom, but that's what makes it so aromatic and adds juices to the mix. Otherwise the meat was pure delight and falling apart at a touch of a fork.  Perhaps I wish there were more mashed potatoes on the plate, but they leveled it off with excellent trumpet mushrooms and thick, crunchy and crispy bacon lardon, pearl onions, and pommes mousseline, so I have no beef with the chef at all.  Oh, and you can't leave without trying at least one bite of the most delicious Opera Cake, but you won't be able to stop at one...I guarantee it!",

I had read great reviews on this restaurant online, and had elected it as the final dinner on my trip (I like to save the best for last).  When I arrived, a waiter engaged me.  I explained that this was my first trip to a French restaurant, and that I was looking for the complete immersion experience.  He suggested a 7 course sampler meal, which ended up being more of an event.  I cant readily recollect every serving which was set in front of me, but each was a delight.  My final dish was Bananas Foster, and let me tell you... the s**t was bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s (ain't that right Gwen).  I don't think they could have presented a better delicacy.  It was the perfect compliment to the previous six courses.  Swoop Says: How do you say 'Bon apptit' in French?  I am all compliments.  They even used a tiny broom to sweep the crumbs from my table.

I dunno what it is, but most places these days won't seat you until the whole party has arrived.  I think it has something to do with the economy and trying to seat as many parties as possible to eat.  Bistro Bis doesn't do that.  They were patient and accommodating.  The food was excellent.  They do need to learn how to pour a beer.  There was more head on the Duvel than beer itself.  Duck Hash Landaise was great.  Well seasoned and fresh.  Is the food good?  Sure.  Is the place suitable for a date?  Not that I was on one, but yeah, if you were one of those government types trying to seal a deal that either gets you some action or you're trying to exploit your constituents.  Would I go here again?  Not really my regular style.  Ask me again during the next Restaurant Week.  People thought your review was:  Funny 2",

Even though this restaurant is technically located inside a hotel, I get the sense that most of the diners are not staying there. The breakfast crowd is somewhat busy, but the lunch crowd when Congress is in session is completely full. I imagine that when Congress is not in session, the place is definitely not as busy.  The breakfast here is not very \"French.\" It's just general egg dishes and stuff like that, and it's fine for a working breakfast. The lunch has more \"French\" highlights, and most recently I ordered the beef bourguignon. Honestly, for $19 I expected something more substantial. Compared to Le Diplomate, this one pales in comparison. The beef was cooked very well, but it was more sized like and appetizer and not an entr\u00e9e. So if you just ordered this dish, like I did, you don't leave very full. For tourists, I think this restaurant is overpriced.  Overall, this is a business restaurant. The service is punctual and rather formal, but it's a nice place.",

We arrived about 1/2 and hour before our reservation and were seated immediately.  Our waiter was very gracious and was around just the right amount -- there when you need, but not constantly hanging around.  We got the halibut and the Duck au Rhubarb.  The Halibut was good, but not as flavorful as we had expected.  The Duck was wonderful! A very creative unique blend of flavors.  The watercress soup was a scrumptious appetizer and served beautifully at the table.  Though we only ordered one soup to share, the waiter gave us a second soup free.  Also, the chef sent out a free serving of delicious baked macaroni and cheese.  On top of all of that the waiter sent us a complimentary desert plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate syrup on it.  All in all, this was a wonderful restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone.  The only thing that was less than stellar in any way was that the restaurant was a bit noisy, but not so much that it was terribly distracting.",
