Another table and I were the only ones there during an early weekday afternoon. However, it was difficult to get the attention of anybody so that I could pay my bill. I was talking to the owner and was about to ask for the check, and while I was in mid sentence, he completely ignored me when another group of 3 girls arrived. After waiting 10-15 minutes, I just got up and found someone so I could just leave.  Brooklyn has many good restaurants, and you need not waste your time here.",
