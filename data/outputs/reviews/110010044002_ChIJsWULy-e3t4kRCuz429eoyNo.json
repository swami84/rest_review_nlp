My family (three of us) each ordered very different entrees and we all left raving about how delicious it all was. Service was perfect and the pride that the owners have in the restaurant was very evident.  I will definitely return and highly recommend this if you're in the neighborhood.  My only advice to the owners is to improve the signage. We are from out of town and not familiar with the neighborhood. Even with the gps taking us directly to your front door, it was still difficult to find. Other than that, perfection.",

Worst thing I ate was the gnocchi and everything and I mean everything was coated in oil. -Saturday night - dinner was 2 hours, only 3 tables occupied in the restaurant -Absurdly overpriced - probably the worst value in a decade of eating in DC; $198 for 2 people not including gratuity -Poor value - got 1/2 pasta portion that was charged $14 and regular portion is $21 -Groupon: gives them the ability to mark up the pricing  COCKTAILS: Aperol Spritz (very common drink in Italy) $13 -1st one: missing Prosecco (how is this possible? These are the ingredients: 2 oz Prosecco, 1 1/4 oz Aperol, Splash of Soda water, only 3 ingredients how do you miss 1????) -2nd one: had a fly in it -3rd one: too much Prosecco not enough Aperol -4th one: whatever at this point  APPETIZERS: POLIPO - $16.90 oven-roasted Spanish octopus | organic baby arugula *really tiny slices of octopus, chewy and completely drenched in oil  APPETIZER SPECIAL: SALSICCA with ONIONS over MASHED POTATOES - $17 *this was the best dish but again I don't understand why there is so much oil  PASTA: GNOCCHI $21.90 - for the 1/2 portion they charged $14...uh ok you're charging 2/3 of the regular price that's absurd ricotta cheese dumpling pasta | tomato sauce *smallest gnocchi I've ever seen - identical size and flavor of Chef Boyardee canned pasta mini O's  PASTA SPECIAL: TORTELLINI PASTA with SALMON with same Chef Boyardee tomato sauce - $26 *super fishy and weird with tomato sauce  SECONDI: IL MERCATO DEL PESCE - $32 fresh whole fish of the day | arugula salad | lemon olive oil *Branzino: about 4 large bones and again they love oil...completely coated in it; arugula salad also covered in olive oil  DESSERT: TIRAMISU - $10 (OMG what a ripoff it was so small!) *Gross, soggy, messy, some sort of disgusting berry sauce splattered on the plate.

It's a cute little place and definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and craving some delicious pasta. It was super dead for a Sunday evening. We were the only people in the restaurant, but it looked fairly business outside since it was a 3 day weekend. Nice and quiet evening, which I can't complain about. Large window at the front where we were sitting and it was nice to be able to people watch and see what was going on outside. I'm guessing the woman that greeted us was the owner.  We started with the Pcaccia Bianca (baked flat bread topped with fresh mozzarella and arugula, with truffle oil). It was fresh, warm, and cheesy. All 3 things are great when involving cheese. I also had the Rigatoni Alla Juliana (pasta, ground Italian pork sausage, onions, cream, and truffle oil). The pasta was absolutely fabulous. I couldn't get enough and was a bit bummed out when I had finished it. There's a whole lot of flavor in this plate of pasta. The pasta was cooked just right. It wasn't too soft or too hard. Each bite made my mouth water, and I wanted more. I was excited to dip the complimentary bread into the leftover sauce in the end. Can't waste that precious creamy sauce.  Service was fast and friendly. Average prices for an Italian restaurant. Not sure about parking in the area, but we took and Uber over from downtown.",

While the pasta in the rigatoni dish was well cooked, it was drowned in oil, so there wasn't much to taste.  Aside from the food being terrible, the service was poor as well.

We arrived there at 8:40pm and were promptly seated. However, we soon found out that only 1 waiter would be taking our orders and it took him so long to explain the specials menu and he kept running downstairs that by the time he finally got all of our orders it was 9:30pm.  Then we notice that the table next to us had a basket of bread which we never received. We had to ask one of the waiters 3 times for bread (which they said was in the oven) and when they finally brought it out it was as cold as bricks. Finally around 10:15pm they start bringing out our food only too find out that the computer that they put the orders into had a glitch so it messed up all of our orders so they had to send in our orders all over again... so we got our food at basically 10:45pm!!! More than 2 hours after our reservation!!!  I take one bite and I hate it. I can tell the chef rushed to make it because the pasta was barely cooked and it lacked seasoning. I don't understand how you're an italian restaurant and get pasta wrong! All of my friends were also displeased with their meals. One of my friends tried to send her meal back and order another and the chef stormed upstairs and was extremely rude basically yelling at my friend reasons why she should like it. Mind you, it was my friend's 21st birthday but it would have been unacceptable to talk to ANY customer like that. We later come to find out that that chef was the owner... I also noticed that the table sitting next to us was also displeased. They were a table of four and only two of them got their entrees on time and the rest had to wait almost over 1 hour to get their food.  In conclusion, safe yourself the headache and avoid this place!",

We came to here for my friend's birthday expecting great service based on the reviews and we did not receive that. First, We ordered our meals around 9pm. After sitting for about an 1h30 mins, we realized that our food was not at our table. We asked our server (who was very nice) what happened and he stated how there was a glitch in the computer and our meals were never sent to the kitchen. On top of this, service was slow, not bread on the table and watered down drinks. our server gave us appetizers on the house (which we pretty much argued for) and the portions were very small. Our food finally came around 11PM!!! YES 11PM. The birthday girl did not like the meal she ordered and asked to exchange it. THIS WAS WHEN THE DRAMA BEGAN! The chef walked in with the MOST HARSH and AGGRESSIVE attitude questioning what my friends did not like and etc. My friend ended up ordering something else and THE chef walked away with an even worst attitude. IT was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER...HERE ARE PICS TO PROVE IT.",

Her recommendations and chefs preference were amazing. The love and time this family puts into their food and guest's experience is a direct reflection of the same I experienced while in Italy.

This small but comfortable kitchen makes quite wonderful, authentic pasta dishes that don't try to wow you with a hundred flavors going on...they trust the simple flavors of their ingredients and completely nail the rustic tastes they are presenting. I've only had the pastas, but they are fantastic with just the right size portions. I tell everyone I know to go here, and everyone I've brought has loved it.",

They were very accommodating for my friend's birthday and allowed us to stay well after closing. About six people, including management, would check in on us to make sure we were doing well.  The food was a little disappointing, particularly the skewers, and there wasn't a wide selection to pick from. One of the owners came to the table to offer Parmesan cheese to those who ordered pasta dishes, but when I ask for some (I ordered a delicious chicken entree) I was told \"oh no honey, we are Italian we don't mess with our food\" and was instructed to place the Parmesan cheese on the side until she left, before I could add it to my food.  We found this to be really amusing--their sense of pride and commitment to being a truly Italian restaurant was charming. This is a great and convenient place to eat before hitting the party scene on U Street.",
