The last 3 visits, their to-go pre-wrapped sandwiches are probably 2/3 the size, and 1/2 the content than the one shown in the case or how they used to be. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first 2 times, but after the 3rd time I think it is just the new norm. It feels dirty to display a sandwich, and get something far less. At $9.50, there are many better lunch options downtown. I will no longer be going here for lunch, but only to get bread or other speciality products.  Edit*: haha. Removing another star as there was a long black hair in my tiny sandwich. Sad that this place has gone so far down.",
