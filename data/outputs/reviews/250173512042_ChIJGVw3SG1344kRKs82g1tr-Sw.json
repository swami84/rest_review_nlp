I got the Kati Roll which was delicious and perfectly wrapped in home made paratha. It paired very well with the house made mustard sauce or kasundhi. I also got the Shingara which was crispy and warm and had a nice added touch of chaat masala. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the food and would love to go back.",

Nibble has a rotation of different chefs, the one I've experienced (and continued to return to) is Chef Afruza Akther who makes insanely good Bengali street food.  The Chicken Kati Roll with an omelette added has all the flavor you hope to find when going out. It is a perfect amount of food, and keeps me going without being too heavy.  I'll end this love letter with this: Nibble, and Chef Afruza , is something to experience.",
