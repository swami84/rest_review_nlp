They now have new owners and it's called Raffaelo's. Several weeks ago I ordered a breaded chicken sandwich only to be delivered a grilled chicken sandwich.  No big deal I said,  I let it go.  Went there a couple of weeks ago ordered 20 buffalo chicken wings. They came in a big try covered in sauce. They were actually quite good.  So yesterday I wanted them again. I placed my order and went to pick up 15 wings and a chicken ceaser salad.  When I got home I was extremely disappointed.  There was hardly a drop of sauce anywhere yo be found. Tasted just like a regular wing. Opened my ceaser to find it swimming in dressing almost like soup. I called to complain and finally agreed with the lady I was speaking with ro come in next week to get a free ordered of wings. All good right? Nope she preceded to call me back and say she couldn't give me the wings next week due to not having proof and not knowing if the kitchen messed up.  I said ok wanna pkay that game I'll be right over.  Having only eaten 3 of the wings due to the disappointment. I knew I would have no problem shoving this in their face. After all this trouble they did end up giving me my money back. But to little to late they lost a cutomer that has been going there for 15 years.",
