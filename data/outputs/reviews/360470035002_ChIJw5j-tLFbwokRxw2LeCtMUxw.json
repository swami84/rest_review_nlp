I asked why he would not and he had no real reason other than it\u2019s delivery from No. 1. When I attempted to verify myself by asking him to see the ticket he refused to hand over my ticket, this then lead to a tug of war of sorts between him and I with the ticket. Eventually I got it from him and didn\u2019t understand the writing so I then asked can u please look in the bag to make sure that my order are wings and fries he refused to do that and drove off. I never have issues with this place outside of when it\u2019s time for delivery there delivery guy is completely unprofessional and that shud not be the way u conduct business especially since my support of this business is what keeps there business running. I was downstairs with my two year old son when all of this occurred not to mention I am 6wks pregnant. Initially when I placed my order I asked if they cud deliver upstairs to my door I explained to the lady that I was pregnant and in the house with my two year old son and didn\u2019t want to leave him upstairs cuz he was battling the flu they told me \u201cno\u201d to bring my baby downstairs or they will not deliver I complied but then when I got down stairs this is the experience I had with their delivery guy . This place is terrible terrible terrible and moving forward I will never order from them due to a lack of professionalism.",
