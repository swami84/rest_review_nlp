First off, the chips are excellent, warm, puffy and a hint of salt... 5 stars! The salsa is okay, no cilantro (lucky for diner #2), but there isn't much depth of flavor (3.5 stars). The tamales were very good to me, another thought they were heavy...he wanted a lighter, fluffier texture. The pork filling and the red sauce were very good and I gave them 4+ stars. I heard positive comments from my two tablemates about their dishes so it was a thumbs up, foodwise. There are two tables that can accommodate 6 people, plus counter seating for 4 - 6 more (I recall). The owner is nice and friendly and we now have two choices for Mexican food in downtown Honolulu. We'll be back! Recommended!",

The menu is simple with tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tamales, and carne asada fries. (Sides and drinks as well) keeping it simple is a great idea, do a few things very well and people will notice.  The whole restaurant is very clean, even to the point that you'd think this was a brand new location. So kudos to the staff for keeping things looking amazing. The only bad part is that I wish I knew of this spot sooner.  I also need to mention they have a vegetarian tamale, I didn't try it this time but I will next time I come. Enjoy the photos, they will speak volumes of the taste.",

        "caption": "Last week I got the chorizo breakfast burrito and my BF and I split both the New Mexico Red and Santa Fe Green tamales. I also bought a dozen tamales to eat for breakfast throughout the week. The breakfast burrito is only $4 and it's my new favorite cheap eats in the Chinatown area. And, I thought the dozen tamales would be given to me frozen but to my surprise, they were fresh so I took them home and froze what I wasn't going to eat immediately. Today, I came back for a breakfast burrito but they stop serving them at 10:30...I was bummed but it was the opportunity to try something different so I got a Carne Asada Chimichanga ($11.50). It comes stuffed with rice and beans but it's also smothered - which isn't my preference, since it loses the yummy fried crispiness in the sauce - but it's my fault for not reading the menu closely. Overall, it was tasty but when I go back tomorrow (yes, i do love it here!), I'm ordering the breakfast burrito...and I'm going to try a vegetarian tamale. I'll probably order another dozen of them.  Tips: - Street parking, bring change - Look for their specials, which is printed and taped to the menu. Last week it was Stacked Enchiladas (my BF explained it as \"enchilada lasagna\") and today it was Indian taco - It's a small space - 1 table that seats 4, 1 table that seats 2, and bar seating with a couple of stools facing out at Nuuanu St. Both times I went have been on the weekend and there was seating available. They seem to get a steady stream of to-go orders.",
