Our waiter, who we have had before and has always been very friendly, was very obviously flustered. Our food took much longer than normal but still seemed like it sat around for a while before being served to us. There was a man, maybe a new manager, because I did not see the female manager who is usually there, awkwardly walking around but maybe serving tables at the same time? I can tell the staffs reaction to him was not a positive one. It was VERY tense. The only person working I saw smile the entire time we were there was a girl carrying an arm full of dishes that I passed in the hallway on my way to the restroom. I\u2019m almost embarrassed I brought friends here today. I promised them this isn\u2019t the typical feel of miga. I don\u2019t know what caused whatever was going on tonight but I hope it doesn\u2019t continue. Maybe I\u2019ll give them a few months to cool off.",

Miga is Asian fusion, and by that I mean Korean combined with nouveau Italian and French. We had some of the best white fish I've ever had (butterfish) and the scallops, which were huge and very tasty. We start things off sharing the wasabi salad and some finely mixed drinks. Everything was excellent, and the service was on point. Highly recommend Miga for your next occasion.",

My favorite food at Miga is their rolls and sushi. The food is really good in general, but the rolls were shockingly delicious. The decorations of the food were really pretty too, and it made me want to eat the food more. The fish on the rolls and the sushi weren\u2019t frozen fish, so I could eat the sushi fresher! I\u2019ve been to a lot of Japanese restaurants, but I have never tasted food like Miga\u2019s. I sincerely recommend this restaurant to people who want to visit Champaign or live in Champaign but have never been to Miga. I really suggest this restaurant!",

The hostess was extremely rude and unwelcoming, and made us feel very uncomfortable. We walked in at 8:49 pm and she said the kitchen closes at 9 and all of the customers are finishing up. That\u2019s it, nothing else. A very awkward moment transpired where we had to ask what time is it and will we be able to order? I tried to lessen the awkwardness by saying maybe another night, but my date insisted we give it a shot and so we ordered drinks and a few sushi rolls as soon as we sat down. When our server came over, we explained what had just happened and he said he still had orders in, which clearly shows all of the customers were not almost finished. We enjoyed the ambiance, drinks and sushi, but unfortunately the unfriendly welcome at the door before 9 pm ruined this first time experience for us at Miga.",

Water was poured in glasses at unattended tables. That seemd kind of unsanitary to me. And it wasn't cold.  The menu was very limited unless you liked sushi and/or nigri. But three out of the four of us weren't big sushi fans. It was an ok but pricey experience and I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. Our waiter Derek was woderful though.",

It was like watching an art form- I would definitely recommend trying out this spot. I got the Nigiri Chef special and every piece was delicious. We also got a Sushi \"dessert\"- more of a night cap. This was very special and unlike anything else I have ever experienced. This is a truly unique experience, especially if you allow the chef to dictate your meal. However, as many of the other reviews have stated, be prepared to dig into your pocket for this night out.",

I'm not gonna lie...at first I was bummed because I was really looking forward to the sea bass which is no longer on the menu.  I decided to stay because the owner had already come by to greet me and brag about the new sushi menu. I was skeptical (and so sad I wasn't getting miso sea bass!) but all that went away when I tasted my first dish, the yellowtail crudo. OMG it was truley amazing and so so fresh. From there I had the Mexican Roll (tuna, cilantro, I can't remember what else), then the maguro nigiri. I really can't say enough as to how amazing it all was. I loooove sushi and love to put my fancy sushi dinners on the boss' credit card all over the country. I can't say how pleasantly surprised I was to find such an amazing place, especially in Champaign. Miga will still be my go to place when I'm in town.",

I am somewhat stingy on rating restaurants, becuase I strongly believe that there is always something to be improved. However, every aspects of Miga were above my expectations.  First of all, servers. They have been trained really, really, well. They studied thoroughly for all the menu, and they could give me all the details about how the foods are prepared and cooked.  Next, cleanliness. I usually go to the restroom to check the cleanliness. Restroom is easy to clean compared to the kitchen. If restroom is dirty, you can expect that the kitchen would be the same. Miga passed my restroom test, which not many restaurants in Champaign do. Not only that, general cleanliness of the overall area is very clean.  Third, environment. Let's say you have your significant other with you and would like to bring them to a nice place. Miga is the ONE. Some restaurants think that dim lighting is the only way to enhance the mood. Well, aren't you tired of eating your food without being able to see them? Miga has decent lighting but still could enhance the romantic mood, which is not at all easy thing to be done.  Last but not the least, the food itself. Well, I've said enough about other aspects, and you know what I would tell you about the food quality. Besides, you wouldn't believe my words unless you go and try them yourself.  It is hard to find a nice place where everything is perfect but, I am telling you, Miga will satisfy every aspects of you are looking for.  Added note: Miga also has awesome brunch menu served on Sundays!!",

A chunk of pork replaces the slice of bacon.   When we asked for plates to share this salad, we were given 6 inch small plates that didn't even comfortably hold a slice of this ungainly monster of a \"salad\".

The food was good, but the prices seemed out of sync with the actual quality of the food. Still, it felt good enough that I wanted to try again. I ate here 2 times in 2016, and just ate here again tonight. The ambience is great! The food is edgy, so some flavor combinations are unexpectedly amazing and others are not for me. But tonight, the service just disappointed me. We had come from a wine tasting, and we just didn't want to order a drink right away. Perhaps that annoyed our server. We ordered two appetizers and a main dish to \"start with,\" and our server, again, seemed annoyed. We ordered a sashimi salad (the chunks of sashimi tuna and salmon were just too big - we were expecting thin slices), Miga crunch fries (seriously the best thing on the menu!), and halibut. The food took an unreasonably long time to come out, but the temperature was right. Our server didn't come back to check on us until we were done with the meal, and we didn't feel like ordering another plate (scallops with tomato basil foam) and waiting even longer. I watched her drink coffee at the bar and visit other tables, but didn't come back to us. She wasn't rude-  just annoyed, I guess. When she took our plates, she barely said thanks, she just acted like we weren't even there. I just don't get it.",

The art of hospitality was not consciously ingrained in the servers.  For example, food were served without serving spoon/fork and while we waited hot food got cold because our server seemed to have forgotten until being asked again.  I would think that owners and operators of modern restaurants would train their service helps better.  The long wait for drink orders or other requests seemed unreasonable since the restaurant was not very busy when we were there.  The food arrived at reasonable time but the small lack of common sense service seems incongruous. If the idea is to draw out the wait time for anything, then it was well done.  If the idea is for servers to be inefficient in their job then they hit the mark. Please do better because I like the place and the food a lot. And I don't want to leave a grudging tip. I'm willing to reward good job well done.  I want to see Miga around 20-30 years from now here in Champaign, Illinois.",

The staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu and willing to offer suggestions. I ordered the ceviche as a starter and didn't receive what I expected, so definitely ask away before finalizing an order. First time experience was nice, I look forward to coming back.",

All of our menu selections were delicious.  Seafood was perfectly prepared.  Their signature mixed drink was refreshing.  Wines pair well with their menu.  Something on the menu for everyone from the meat lover to the vegan.  Both Asian and French influences are well represented.  We are planning to be regulars!  Can't wait till they are open for lunch.",
