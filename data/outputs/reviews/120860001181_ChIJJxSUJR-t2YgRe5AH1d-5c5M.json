Theres also a tall guy who manages take-outs, he is very kind and nice! I come here everyday for a cup of orange juice for my nephew, and end up ordering couple different drinks. Their Pina Colada Smoothie is MUST TRY! Moreover, their menu is also crowded with whole bunch of salads, healthy treats, smoothies, juices, bowls, sandwiches and lot more. They always offer free sample drinks, juices! We used to order from neighbouring eateries but now only Sproutz! I strongly recommend! Keep doing well, Crew!",

My daughter is vegan and gluten-free and she was pleased with the options for her. I had the zucchini spaghetti and it was wonderful! The noodles were cooked well-  not soggy or undercooked. So yummy!  They just opened up so seating is limited but I understand tables and chairs are coming soon. We ate our meal outside at the high tables.  I highly recommend the place.",

BUT I will have to say, since they made the change from Carrot Express the quality in the food has gone down a bit. I hope that you guys can take this criticism to help your business as I am someone who used to order every week and now I do sparingly.  The chicken is very, very dry and very plain, not seasoned at all. When cutting into the chicken it is still a bit pink inside.  I stopped ordering the wraps because the chicken is so dry that it ruins the entire meal even after dumping a whole sauce cup on top of it. The platters used to come with super fresh pico de gallo and a nice portion\u2026Today, there is a spoon full of pico (mostly juice from the tomato) and the tomatoes seem not as fresh as I have seen in the past. The Cilantro lime dressing is now thick and lumpy; it used to be light and smooth.  Lastly, the red onions that you put in the chicken salad now turn your chicken bright pink\u2026I almost dumped the dish out because it looked like uncooked chicken. (Just something to take into consideration.) I truly believe these are easy fixes that you should take seriously as I have been getting the same feedback from others. Thank you and I hope to be a regular again!",

The ingredients we're well distributed, I would definitely order it again. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the negligence of the cashier today. I placed the order online and when I came in I told him it's my first time here. According to the receipt I paid at 12:34. I stood directly in front of the cashier as there was no other space inside the restaurant to stand. At around 12:55 I became a little restless and began checking my watch while looking around. A very nice blonde lady came up to me and asked if I'm waiting to pick up. It turns out that my order was was ready the whole entire time I was standing there, the cashier just forgot to tell me that I have to pick up my order in the rear of the restaurant. Mind you, I was very polite when meeting him and even tipped the standard 10% on a takeout order. So it's not like he was angry with me for being rude or not tipping.",

The wrap came with a green dressing that we were told was famous, it went very well with the wrap. The acai bowl was a generous portion and the girl who made the bowl was very friendly. The atmosphere was busy (we went during lunch time) but the service was quick, definitely an \"express\" environment without sacrificing taste and quality. We would most definitely go again when we are back in town.",
