        "caption": "Had takeout for Maine Restaurant Week...ordered a few burgers for my two boys and me and had three flavors of wings and Fries. I appreciate the effort to explore new flavors. The onions on my Mushroom Burger were way too sweet and detracted from the overall flavor. Bacon and Bleu burger was better, as was the American Burger. French fries were just pretty good- a tad undercooked, but still ok. Wings were on the smaller side, but good, just not up to the level of other superior options in Portland, such as Bingas and King's Head. Prices were reasonable. Service was efficient. Probably unlikely to head back, but may give them another shot at some point.",

        "caption": "XO Burgers & Wings is absolutely unreal! Wasn\u2019t sure what to expect of this pop-up/ghost kitchen concept, but given that it\u2019s from the same folks as Eventide, you know it\u2019s going to be good. My partner and I ordered the bacon blue cheese burger, the horseradish burger, the gourmet sauce wings, the chili wings and a side of fries. And yes, we experienced the most luxurious of food comas afterwards. The fries were amazing, like McDonald\u2019s but without the carcinogens. Crispy, salty and very addicting. Both burgers were packed with toppings and a sauce that drips down your face as you\u2019re eating it. Napkins are a must for this. We thought the portions would be smaller given the cheaper price, but were definitely surprised by the amount of food. Hasn\u2019t even been 24 hours since we last ate here and I\u2019m already contemplating when to go again.",
