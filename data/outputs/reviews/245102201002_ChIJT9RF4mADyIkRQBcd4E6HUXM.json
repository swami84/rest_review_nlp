Like over an hour for two chicken sandwiches. A convention was in town though so they were swamped, understaffed id say. Having said all this, the food was really good. Really good chicken sandwiches. The one waiter, a young guy apologized profusely at which I told him it's ok, you're doing a great job. When it came to pay, the same waiter, he may have been the manager, paid for our dinner w his own money! You don't see that anymore and we were astonished by his generosity. So overall, it's a hotel restaurant that gets extremely busy, but our food was great, the staff was very nice and as long as you are a reasonable human being who understands that the staff is only human too, you'll have a nice time.  To the gentleman who paid for our dinner, thank you. It meant a lot to my wife and I and it was very refreshing to see that. Thanks!",
