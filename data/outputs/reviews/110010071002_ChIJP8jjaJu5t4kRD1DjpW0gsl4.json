Cocktails were actually pretty reasonable as well. We got a take home bottle of margarita for 2 and it was great. My only real complaint was the wait.

Our top order is still the Hi-Fi Taco, Orange Soda braised pork with the smoked crema. Too delicious. Just order it with your drinks as an appetizer. Please.  Love. The. Roost. The perfect stop for drinks, food, and relaxation.  Covid-19 precautions in place--- seating is generously distanced and the inside (which is wide open to the outdoors) is well distanced and ventilated. They are continuing to add new restaurants- We have tried Shelter,  Hi-Fi tacos, and  Red Apron burgers and poutine.  All very delicious. If they can they make it gluten free, you can simply select the option on your phone (you order from your phone).  The gluten free selection is expansive and includes the poutine which is quite impressive as many times flour is used in the gravy. We have yet to try the pizza place, Slice, or State Fair (and not sure if those have gluten free).  A new local favorite.",

The wait staff is amazing and attentive but with a QR based ordering system you don't have to deal with them if you don't want too, the entire facility has taken social distancing very seriously and you will not feel crowded over here.

The coffee shop puts tables and chairs outside and Shelter has a large outdoor patio with seating.  The Roost is already a local hangout spot thanks to Shelter.
