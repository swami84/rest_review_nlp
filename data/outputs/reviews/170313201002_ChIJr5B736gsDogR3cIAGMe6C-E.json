So we waited then called in our order, went to pick up and waited another 30 minutes. The bar tender then realized that I was still waiting for my food. When they came out it was just burger and no fries because they still hadn\u2019t figured out the oil. We like their burgers so we decided to give it another chance this past Sunday.... well I guess they just change the business hours as they please.... can\u2019t do business if you can\u2019t run a kitchen and you shut down when you feel like.

He remembered your name even though he was busy taking care of many others by himself at the bar. He was gracious and engaging in conversation when he had a moment. My wife works in the industry and I know what a great bartender looks like and Lee is absolutely it.

        "caption": "A nice place to get blasted before a movie. The menus were a bit messy like previous reviews stated, but the bar was staffed by 3 bartenders so it seems they got that sorted.  Drink selection is a bit limited, asked for a hurricane and they couldn't make it. I ordered the Bruce Banner and it was pretty good, had a lot of apple flavor so the squeeze of lime is more of a necessity than an extra. I also ordered the Weyerbacher Sunday Morning Stout which was VERY good, tastes a lot like coffee.  What we were told is Brass Tap was strict as a corporation and this location didn't have much of a say with beer and food picks so they may be in a transitional period. Full disclosure, we didn't order food so I have no clue how the experience is with that.",

While waiting for the event to start we ordered waters, during this time we glanced over the menu and began to order, the server explained that their menu is limited and they do not have all of the food offered on the menu. This made me very upset because we were not informed of the limited menu before or after being seated, furthermore the alcohol and food menus were both made of paper. I don't understand why their menu quality is the equivalent to what I could print out at home, many other bars in this area have nice high quality menus, while this bar does not. Now what made me the most upset is that another sever came up to us and said \"Hey guys, you cannot be at this event if you don't order anything besides water\" however the food I wanted to order was not available, due to the limited selection. Shortly after the announcer of the event reiterates over the microphone \"that customers who do not order anything besides water can not participate in the event\". Yes I do understand thier perspective it's no secret this is a business that is looking to make money, but I do not appreciate being called out over the intercom, seconds after the server walked away from our table, when I actually attempted to order two dishes - which they did not have either of the items I was asking to purchase. It was extremely disrespectful, and it's just simply bad business. I came in to have a good meal and enjoy a nice night out, but this company did not provide the items that were displayed in the menu as well as good service. They have now lost four customers, we will not be returning.",

I\u2019ve had plenty of bacon and grilled cheese sandwhiches that were tasty.. this one at American Craft was straight up disgusting. The tomato soup was just gross. Tasted almost rotton. I literally took a sip and nearly gagged! And I love tomato soup! How can they even call this tomato soup??  It\u2019s unfortunate bc i work next door and it\u2019s convenient to stay around here to buy lunch. But never ever again.  Huge waste of $11.",

        "caption": "I really want to like this place but I can't yet. We were there about 7pm on a Saturday before our movie. There were only about four customers in the restaurant when we arrived. We sat at the bar and were quickly greeted. The server gave us our menus. The first really big issue was the number of beers. They have 42 taps. The menu only had 29 draft beers on it and only 21 were available. So they were only offering half the number of beers that they could. I really wanted wanted to try something that I have not had. I did get something that I have not had but the choices were very limited. We ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad with the flight of filet. Both of these dishes were pretty tasty. The tomato and mozzarella salad had grape tomatoes and small mozzarella balls covered in a very tasty dressing. The flight of filet had three different 1/4 thick pieces of filet. One piece was coffe rubbed, one was pepper rubbed and the last was bacon wrapped. The coffee rubbed was the best tasting. The bacon wrapped was decent but the bacon was almost as large as the piece of filet. Another opportunity was the server telling me halfway thru my beer that today was manday. This ment whiskey and bourbons were two for one. If I would have known this at the beginning, I probably would have gone with that. The overall feel and look of the inside is nice and fits the idea of what they are trying to be. They have many promotions to bring customers in, from the many trivia nights. I want to give them another chance but they have a lot to fix in the beer choices, as this is what they are.",
