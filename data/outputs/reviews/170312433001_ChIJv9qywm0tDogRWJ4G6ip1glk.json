We got it delivered and the sides (fries and mac and cheese) didn\u2019t travel too well but I think they would definitely be good for dining in (hopefully one day). The hot chicken sandwiches were excellent and the best we have had outside of Nashville. No way I could ever have anything above a hot, I don\u2019t know how people do it! The tender plate meal was excellent value for money too.",

I'm comparing Fry The Coop to some of the greatest hot chicken places there are.  Long story short: it's a really good place for a chicken sandwich better than Popeye's and a couple beers but I can't say it's on the same level as other hot chicken places in Chicago.  Pros: Great atmosphere, friendly wait staff, sides were very tasty (tried mac & cheese and fries), and the sandwich I got was overall great - disclaimer on the chicken itself in a moment.  The bar looked like it had a great selection of beer on tap but we didn't get anything to drink.  Cons:  On the dinner menu there were only chicken sandwiches, tenders, and chicken & waffles as entrees on the menu.  No bone-in chicken.  I'm a huge fan of hot chicken and was hoping to order two pieces of chicken alone so I was kind of disappointed that wasn't an option.  Oh well, reviews for the sandwiches are amazing so I went for the Nashville Fried Chicken Sandwich.  Next I had to choose a spice level.  I typically like very spicy foods.  Not off the charts spicy, but prefer something with a good kick.  My fianc\u00e9 opted for the \"Medium\" heat level (2/5), which she usually does, and i prefer to go for something hotter so I went with \"Hot\".  Keep in mind, at the time of this review, \"Hot\" is number 3 on the list of their 5 total spice levels.  There were two levels above this - Crazy and Insane.  I went to the online menu to check if this was correct and it is different online, which is interesting.  Anyways, I ask for Hot and the cashier gives me a warning that it has habaneros in it.  That's fine, I like habaneros and I'm familiar with the heat level that comes with them and I told him so.  So our food comes and it looks really good.  The brioche bun was fresh and tasty.  I really like the sauce they put on the sandwich as well.  The problem was that this thing was WAY too hot.  My fianc\u00e9 was enjoying her medium spice level with no problem at all while I was sweating my way through this sandwich.  If you've been to Prince's in Nashville, the Hot level I got was probably between their x-hot and xx-hot levels.  I don't think there's a spice level here that's right for me.  That paired with the fact that they don't have just regular bone-in chicken is a deal breaker.  I think there are other, much better Nashville hot chicken places in the city.",

        "caption": "Gotta say this exceeded expectations! Love a crispy hot chicken sandwich, been to Hattie B\u2019s in Nashville & came in this evening for a quick dinner. Everyone was so friendly & the food came out quickly. it was Delicious! I don\u2019t have any pictures because I basically inhaled my sandwich. I had the Chicken & Cheese sandwich at the Mild Level + Mac&cheese. My hubby got the spicy butter fried chicken at the Hot level. The bun is a Brioche Bun, the Chicken was super crispy, pickles we\u2019re perfect. My mild spice was perfect, I had a hint of heat that grew over time - I could have probably tried the medium. My husband loved the Hot heat level (it was too much for me). Mac & cheese was a small portion but enough for us to share. We will definitely be back! Gotta try all The sandwiches, sides & the chicken & waffles which smelled insane!",

        "caption": "My girlfriend and I live in the neighborhood and were walking by yesterday when we noticed the beautifully painted brick building and signage out front.  Excited to see something new on the Chicago Ave strip, we decided to stop in and give the place a try - so GLAD we did!  The Nashville style fried chicken was amazing, they know what they're doing.  I ordered the HOT dry rub on my chicken and boy they are not messing around with spice.... it had ghost pepper in it and it sure was HOT (but that's how I like it).  The portioning is also good - between my entree and sides I had leftovers which is always a plus.  What stood out to us the most was the service and care we received.  After we ordered by the register, they later brought our drinks and food to our table (normal).  Although, during our meal we were checked-in on by staff members multiple times.  They made sure we had enough dipping sauce and that everything was kosher with our food.  Unfortunately, what my girlfriend ordered turned out to be too spicy and she was struggling with the heat.  Without any action on our end, the attentive staff noticed and approached our table to make sure she was satisfied.  They were genuine and addressed the spicy issue quickly by remaking her food.  After that she was able to enjoy her chicken sandwich and we both were very happy with our entire experience.  Everything was delicious!  In all, I'm glad they are so close and look forward to visiting again as well as taking me guest to here.",
