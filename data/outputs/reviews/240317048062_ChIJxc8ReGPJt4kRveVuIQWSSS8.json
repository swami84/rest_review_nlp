The interior design, decorations, and layout really add to the authenticity too (as if you're dining on the streets in Italy), and you really get a sense of the history behind it.  It's one of the oldest restaurants in the city, but despite that still holds it's own compared to any of the countless restaurants that have popped up and disappeared through the years here.

It masterfully imitates the style, feel, and, most importantly, taste of an authentic Italian restaurant (I know because I've toured Italy from Lake Como to the city of Matera). As a Bethesdian for over 40 years and an avid worldly traveler, it's nice to know, especially now when we're all stuck at home, that my family and I don't have to travel far for a taste of Italy.  I am generally not the type of person to write reviews, but my most recent experience at Postiano last Saturday surely warrants one. Let me preface the following by saying that I've been here before and to nearly every other restaurant in Bethesda countless times over. Bethesda's restaurants tend to suffer from a lack of consistency, with the recently closed Cafe Deluxe being a textbook example. The inconsistency in Bethesda was evident long before Corona ever came into the picture. This resulted in what I call \"temporary favorites.\" Restaurants, such as Olazzo, Mon Ami Gabi, Persimmon, and Foong Lin, among a small handful, had their good days and months but eventually they all suffered from some creeping form of deterioration, either in the food, service, or both.  Some of the issues I previously experienced with these restaurants either resurfaced or were exacerbated by Corona. Most notably, the portion sizes have shrunk and service has slowed greatly.  I can probably understand the latter but there is no excuse for the former.  Positano isn\u2019t a \u201ctemporary favorite.\u201d It has been one of my three safety-net favorites during the past decade (with the other two being in Virginia). I never have to worry if what I ordered will be as good as the last time, about the kids not liking their food, or if the service will be bad. Simply put, this restaurant has been consistently good and my most recent experience has reinforced my opinion. What was so unique about my most recent experience? Nothing! The food was excellent and the service was professional \u2013 this being consistent is what I value most.  My wife loves the Eggplant Parmigiana and my kids always order the Chicken Parmigiana with a side of spaghetti. I would recommend the Veal Milanese because it\u2019s both tender and crispy, and closely resembles what I had in Milan.  If you\u2019re looking for a surefire place to eat at (or even an escape from our current situation), go here.",

I am very selective concerning where I contribute my money, because it can be hard to find consistent quality , but this place has exceeded my standards. First, the customer service is amazing. I am always greeted whether I dine in or carry out. The staff is personable, and they even know me by name/the usual order for me (Chicken Milanese+Bruschetta which is amazingggg). Jimmy, who is the owner, has greeted my table various times during my dining which adds a personal touch. It is always clean and comfortable, while maintaining a \u201cfine-dining\u201d ambiance. Service is prompt, professional, and informed. The food is always fresh and hot, despite the 30 minute drive home. The prices are very  reasonable. I am a firm believer in supporting small businesses especially, as they often offer a greater deal of all around quality than many popular food chains, and hidden gems I must say. As of late, they have been closed given current circumstances. But when they open up? I will be the first order lol. Thank you Jimmy and the team for this wonderful establishment. 10 stars across the board \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

Positano is supposedly a long-loved and well known establishment that in the nearly 20 years I've lived here never went to.  We finally decided to go while family was in town for xmas eve.  Sorry we did.  Our waiter complained about how over worked he was, ignored us and never came around after we seated (helping two other tables that were seated after us before getting around taking our drink orders).  We had to ask for the pre-meal bread twice, beers were forgotten from our initial order.  Twice he ridiculed my father for being a nondrinker even after we told him twice my father HAD to quit drinking.  My food came out cold and was 1/2 the portion size of the others who ordered the  exact same dish.  I could keep going on and on about how bad this was but what's the point; I'm sure you get the idea.  We arrived having promised the kids they could order dessert and left without dessert and had to ask for the bill twice.  I clearly stated I wanted the bill but when he arrived with it he kept holding up to the entire table asking who wanted it...staring at my parents (whom he doted on all night, btw).  Despite me (a woman - the problem maybe?) raising my hand to have him give it to me he placed it in the middle of the table somewhat close to my parents.  He was horrible.  WE will never go back.",

I feel so embarrassed for choosing this place.  A few highlights of the night included: -Waiting 15 min to meet a waiter, then took 3 tries to actually bring the wine we ordered -Every table around us was brought bread.. except for ours -An owner who was comfortable ordering staff around in front of us but never actually seemed to help -An exhorbitantly long wait for our meal -Waiter offered to bring parmesan for the table.. but never came back.  Not for the parm, not to check in, not even to bring the check! -Finally went to ask for a check, still took another 15 min to get it  There are a million other restaurants in the area.  Do yourself a favor and choose any other one.",

The food is always delicious, and service warm and courteous. The outdoor sitting in the late Spring and Summer is charming.

Jimmy, the owner and banquet manager, was incredibly cooperative from day one. They have a number of different size rooms and Jimmy helped me decide which was best to accommodate the size of our party plus a DJ and dancing room.  I picked a menu for a VERY reasonable price that included choices of three appetizers, three entrees, and desserts.  Along the way, because many of the guests were seniors, I had to make repeated changes in the menu as well as the number of attendees and Jimmy was gracious and pleasant throughout.  I was able to bring in a few things (veggie platter, fruit platter, cake) to accommodate all the dietary quirks among the guests and there was no problem. At the party, the passed hors d'oeuvres were plentiful and delicious, the entrees were perfectly cooked and hot (I'm not sure how you prepare 30+ servings of moist salmon, but they did it!), and the servers were gracious and responsive.  Two children asked for spaghetti and sauce, which were not the selected entrees, but they were brought in two minutes with no question.  Positano's and Jimmy were a pleasure in every way!!",

        "caption": "We were dressed nice casual when we went here on October 3rd 2015. It was rainy, and a bit cold outside. We had never been to Bethesda or this restaurant before. We went there based on the Google reviews I read. When we came through the second door a person immediately walked up very close to us and had a posture as if he was going to greet us and ask how many of us were there but instead he postured and looked at us and said nothing in that akward moment and his expression to me was to say what are you doing here this is not the restaurant for you. We should have left then. I ended up saying two, and he quickly seated us at the first seat on the wall closest to the door and left us with menus, and a beer list. He quickly left. So, first off the decor in my opinion is tacky and overdone. Look at the Google reviews pictures, look at the floor to the left in the entryway. That's an indicator of the rest of what I was able to see. There are endless amounts of 'decorations' everywhere including an antiquish streetcar for some reason; to me it seemed to just have stuff placed on it, not sure what but it wasn't interesting. Our table which you can see in the pictures is like I said the first one by the door and its next to a wall of used wine bottles on a rack. The light above the table was a pendant that was off center of the table, too low, and too bright for its position. On the table is a little corked bottle of what seemed to be olive oil. We ended up being sort of greeted by a waitress who I think was trying to do a good job but clearly was being expected to handle way too much for what I could later tell was poor management. The waitress had other people that worked with her and I would say they were from the same background which was a different one from which management is and I again got a feeling her and her coworkers were a package deal and they were doing all that they could considering the workload. I looked at the menu, it was one of those menus that has the leather like material sewn around the edges and the menu is inside vinyl pockets. The menu clearly had been used for the last 5-25 years, it was scratched, sticky, dirty, and not user friendly. Theres some tacky story about the restaurant and how such and such will be great at taking over the business when they ride oft into the sunset. A small warm loaf of sliced Italian bread arrived without butter but I figured that's why we for small plates to pour the olive oil onto and dip the bread. Let me tell you this was either bad oil or because it was not infused with seasonings as is common, it was not at all good. The bread was fine plain. Our order was taken without issue but also without anything really. The water glasses bad been filled at this point but I had already noticed they were heavily scratched, dingy looking, and probably dirty also; again they had probably been in use since 1492. The diet coke we ordered arrived in a promotional beer glass with the name of a beer on on, I think it was Hoodengarden or something like that. The glass even had a 30ml marker on it which I think indicate if you put ice to that level then the liquid would be about 30ml. The fact that it was served in these classes meant nothing bad to me, I just mention it because if the person who seated us acted the way he did for the reasons I felt he had then these glasses said nothing for the level of fancy he may think the restaurant is supposed to exude. Nothing on the menu seemed like a great option but we both decided how can you screw up spaghetti and meatballs. While we waited a long time for that to arrive the famy next to us which was two parents and two young teens. Their group was dressed the same as us and they were respectful. When their food arrived there was an issue with one kids food. He waited the entire time the others were eating before he received his meal. This review won't allow much more so let me say the food was low grade, management lurked right next to us, service was slow, we would not return.",

        "caption": "I am Italian and I can say with credibility that this restaurant is as authentic and delicious as it gets when looking at Italian restaurants in the states. Having been to Italy five times, the food at Positano Ristorante tastes just like the food I had while visiting Naples, Rome, Venice, and Sicily, which is absolutely amazing. The food is made to perfection with an amazing surrounding ambiance to complement the meal. Over 35 years, Positano has been serving amazing Italian food and has the best Lasagna in town, a very popular Italian pasta dish. Do not be decieved by American \"Italian\" food like Maggiano's and Olive Garden, eat real delicious Italian food at Positano where everything is made with passion and delivered with elegance.",

The Lasagna for dinner was the best I have ever had. The pasta was hand made and and light and the sauce was perfectly seasoned. My date had Salmon that was fresh and tender. The desserts the tiramisu and rum cake were to live for!  I have traveled the world and this place was top notch. Who knew Bethesda was hiding this little gem.",
