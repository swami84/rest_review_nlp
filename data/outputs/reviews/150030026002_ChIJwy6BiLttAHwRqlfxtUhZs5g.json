Curry in a hurry and easy to make.  Just added coconut milk & a some water then added frozen vegetables. Curry sauce is served. Eating with or without rice. I also added her masala peanuts on top of curry and I just love the crunchiness to the curry!  Don\u2019t hesitate and ask place  your order.  Koki also does Indian cooking lessons. It\u2019s fun & very informative \u2764\ufe0f",

Her food exemplifies that to a tee. So far we have tried rajma, Chole, tadka dal, dal makhani, paneer tikka masala and all were delicious! I know we will continue to order from her.",

Koki takes care to understand what her customers want, communicated when needed for changes, and provided flexibility for pick up. I think the best compliment I can give is that Koki\u2019s food reminds me of my mother\u2019s\u2014 and that\u2019s saying a lot!",
