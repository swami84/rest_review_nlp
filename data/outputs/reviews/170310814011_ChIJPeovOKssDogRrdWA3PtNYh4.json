        "caption": "On November 8, 2018, I had the worst experience involving customer service at Greek Kitchen. My  mother (a cancer patient at Northwestern) and I were just leaving a doctor's appointment and we wanted to stop at Greek Kitchen to have lunch. The restaurant was quite busy, but because this was somewhat normal & we enjoy the food here, we decided to wait in line instead of choosing another nearby restaurant. I can't say whether or not the poor customer service was due to it being a busy day for them, but we were quite disappointed with what happened next.....  As we were paying for our order, my mom noticed that the cashier seemed to be having some sort of trouble with the register, because he swiped my debit card at this register about 6 times (I kid you not.) This left both my mom and I feeling uneasy.... so she asked him whether or not the transaction went through more than once, just to make sure we wouldn't see more than one charge for the visit there. To my surprise, instead of answering the question, he told us to \"take our food and go.\" I could barely believe what he had just said. It truly caught me off guard. I then asked to speak to the manager on duty....  An older woman came out and identified herself as the owner, asking what was going on. As we tried to explain what had happened, she appeared rushed and never offered up an apology for her cashier's behavior. It was like she didn't have time to listen and dared not apologize because it seemed as though she may have been related to the cashier, who looked young enough to be her son. After hearing the story, her one response was asking whether or not we needed a bag. WOW!  My mom and I will never visit this restaurant again. After all, there are tons of gyro spots in Chicago.....and I hope that after reading this, maybe you'll think twice about visiting Greek kitchen also. One of the things that should be top notch in a hospital is customer service.....because even if you suck as a person, You never know what someone who is ill may be going through that day. You never know. Kindness is more valuable than even the tastiest meal. I would hate for you to stop by this restaurant after a visit at Northwestern, only to be insulted by the employees/owner at Greek kitchen like my mom and I were just a few days ago.",
