I had the guava waffles (but definitely plan to come back and try the others). It\u2019s really just whipped cream with guava sauce, but the waffles are delectably light and crispy, and the whipped cream doesn\u2019t make it dense at all! They are perfectly sweet. Very cute and yummy light breakfast/snack place \ud83d\udc96",

Not only was the waffle perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, but the cappuccino was delicious!! My husband had the maple cinnamon waffle and OH MY GOODNESS it was mouthwatering!!! His vanilla latte was also just the right amount of sweet. The owner, Ms. Anna, and her daughter Kapua are so sweet and really make the experience great. Overall, I can\u2019t recommend this place enough. Great for a casual coffee date or a unique treat to end date night. So many flavors to choose from including Lilikoi, lots of fruits, peanut butter, chocolate, and so much more! Go get some waffles!!",
