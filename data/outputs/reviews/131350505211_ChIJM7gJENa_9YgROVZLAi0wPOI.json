We also ordered chicken tenders and mac&cheese for our girls! Let me start with mine. The brisket was soooo dry and the bread looked like it has been sitting outside for a while. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s burger wasn\u2019t the best either. He said that for a bbq place, it actually was bad.  Also I tasted the chicken tenders and the mac&cheese. The chicken looked like it was fryer in old oil and the mac&cheese was totally unseasoned. Like it had no flavor at all! Not even salt! Which makes me wonder how it was possible since the salt should already be in the cheese sauce...  Anyway, we tried this place because of all the nice reviews it had. But for us it was just horrible and we will never go again.",

Very solid BBQ! Pulled pork melts in your mouth. Give it a try next time you are hunting a place to eat. It's the difference in eating in a small local restaurant versus eating in a chain. That's the sum of it.  For us, we'll be back (maybe for dinner tonight)!",

There is so much clean meat on the ribs and the meat just falls off.  I don't know what other BBQ places do for getting their ribs cause Foggy Bottom gets the ribs with the most meat.  Pulled pork isnt loaded with a lot of fat.  It is rare to ever get anything but clean, delicious pulled pork.  The mac n cheese is pretty good.  I personally don't like the beans.  I've had better but you can't touch the ribs and pulled pork.  Brisket is pretty good too.  Never tried the chicken.  They have another location in Loganville.  This is a must try BBQ place.",

We started with some fresh pork rinds which are still crackling when they come out with a spicy dipping sauce that's out of this world. I got the brisket and pimento cheese sandwich and it was just right. We had a large party which they easily accommodated and the vibe was perfect for a family get together. Very kid friendly. The food portions are generous and we literally got our food 15 minutes after placing our order on a Friday night. They have this down to a science. Great spot in the heart of downtown Lawrenceville.",

My wife ended up with chicken wings which were small. .  . The potato salad, the cole slaw need a hell of alot of work and a lot less mayonnaise  .. But the thing that sealed the deal with us and .ade this joint a two star was the banana pudding.. This was without a doubt the worse banana pudding we've purchased in any restaurant anywhere... We left feeling totally let down..",
