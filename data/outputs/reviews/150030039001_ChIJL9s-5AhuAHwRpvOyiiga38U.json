Your table gets lined with a waxed paper and you get dressed with a plastic bib lol! The wait time on food isnt long at all. The atmosphere is casual and the servers are friendly. Been here a few times and always had a great experience and left stuffed! They have a good selection on beers and house margaritas. The lihing mui margarita is our go to.

The building is two stories with indoor/outdoor seating on both levels (super cool).  We went for my daughters birthday was a little bummed that they don't do anything for birthdays.  We were served a bowl of rice which I thought was kind of a cool Hawaii thing (the mainland locations I have been to don't serve rice). We ordered the snow crab combo, order of shrimp and an order king crab. Our food came in bags the littles thought it was so much fun eating from bags. However, it would have been nice to have had a bucket or something for shells/waste.  We are a military family and noticed after reading the reviews they offer a military discount but we were told that our meal didn't qualify for the discount because we ordered a combo.  Overall, food was awesome and staff was friendly. We'll be back!",

No utensils offered. There is no bathroom in the place. You have to walk across the street. The crab we did get tasted spoiled in the body meat. I\u2019d highly suggest you find somewhere else that actually offers fresh food. It\u2019s HAWAII for gods sake. Make fresh seafood.

Everyone was friendly and food was served pretty quickly and was hot and ready.  We had the crab meal and was a great choice with the potatoes and corn and the shrimp, clams and mussels in another bag and all was so delicious.  Market price is a little high above the standard in this area but was still a good price for the amount of food that was served.  Did not leave hungry.",

        "caption": "I had great expectations for this place comparing it to the former Raging Crab in Honolulu however there's not many similarities.  Bottom line, TINY PORTIONS and LOUD.  We decided to not go for the full-fledged crab/crawfish/lobster/shrimp served family style in a plastic bag but instead try their \"I Like It Fried\" baskets.  I ordered the $16 Fried Softshell Crab Basket, the $12.50 Fried Oysters and the $8 Hot Wings (regular size).  My wife and I decided to split a $10 \"Michelada\", a beer/bloody Mary concoction.  I was a bit dumbfounded when they came with the fried oysters.  Maybe six pieces in a tiny plastic basket.  Barely an appetizer for my wife and I.  Next came the crab basket.  Mostly French fries and decent tasting by scant soft shell crab assortment.  Lastly came the hot wings.  Best value going with a decent amount of meaty wings for the price but better can be had elsewhere.  The Michelada drink was really quite tasty but serving a $10 drink in a plastic cup just doesn't cut it.  The loud pop music was cranked up to what I call employee-energy-level but simply too loud for diners to have much conversation.  Add to that sitting near the hand wash station with electric hot air dryer and the decibels hit about 90 when the hand dryer comes on.  Although we didn't get their signature \"What's Your Catch\" seafood bags, all the tables around us did.  I estimated the portion size was well under half of what we got at the former Raging Crab and as the menu lists most of the offerings at \"Market Price\" I would imagine its quite expensive.  Its a lot to pay for a full-on plastic and paper dining experience.  BTW it was my wife's birthday and although she's not big on birthday recognition I did sneak away and ask if they could do anything for her birthday.  They were apologetic however replied \"we do not\".  If you want to try The Boiling Crab my advice is to get there quickly as they can't possibly survive in the costly digs of The Salt at Kakaako.  I don't think even location, location, location will keep this place alive unless they begin to double the portions, lose the plasticware and reduce the prices.",

Our food arrived quickly & there's a full box of napkins when things gets too messy & dirty.  We ordered crawfish, mussels, clams, potatoes, shrimp & corn with the whole-shabang seasoning.  The lemon pepper fries were the bomb & portion good.  Things I wish... 1) have plastic gloves for those who just prefer to keep their hands clean 2) have combo meals for a party of 2 or 3 or 4 or you know what i mean. Everything being ala carte takes too long to decide & in our minds, we're not getting a good deal because 1/2 a cob of corn is $2 and then shrimp is $16/pound & crawfish is $12/pound.. 3) larger crawfish. they were soooo tiny. I felt the one pound was just shells, claws & crawfish head. That tail is so tiny. 4) have hot water cups for hot water so the plastic lining in paper cups don't melt  Overall, parking was easy & validated. Atmosphere was comfortable & spacious.",
