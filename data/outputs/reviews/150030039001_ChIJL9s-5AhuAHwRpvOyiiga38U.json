Your table gets lined with a waxed paper and you get dressed with a plastic bib lol! The wait time on food isnt long at all. The atmosphere is casual and the servers are friendly. Been here a few times and always had a great experience and left stuffed! They have a good selection on beers and house margaritas. The lihing mui margarita is our go to.

The building is two stories with indoor/outdoor seating on both levels (super cool).  We went for my daughters birthday was a little bummed that they don't do anything for birthdays.  We were served a bowl of rice which I thought was kind of a cool Hawaii thing (the mainland locations I have been to don't serve rice). We ordered the snow crab combo, order of shrimp and an order king crab. Our food came in bags the littles thought it was so much fun eating from bags. However, it would have been nice to have had a bucket or something for shells/waste.  We are a military family and noticed after reading the reviews they offer a military discount but we were told that our meal didn't qualify for the discount because we ordered a combo.  Overall, food was awesome and staff was friendly. We'll be back!",

No utensils offered. There is no bathroom in the place. You have to walk across the street. The crab we did get tasted spoiled in the body meat. I\u2019d highly suggest you find somewhere else that actually offers fresh food. It\u2019s HAWAII for gods sake. Make fresh seafood.

Everyone was friendly and food was served pretty quickly and was hot and ready.  We had the crab meal and was a great choice with the potatoes and corn and the shrimp, clams and mussels in another bag and all was so delicious.  Market price is a little high above the standard in this area but was still a good price for the amount of food that was served.  Did not leave hungry.",
