Also, the server I had took really good care of us. She was always making sure we're okay. The bad: I was there for a Thanksgiving dinner, and they were charging top money. But the variety of food, as well as the quality of food, didn't deliver. I had some dark turkey meat and it was tough. I was quite disappointed. Their prime rib was too dry for the 1st piece that I ate. But thank God the second piece was much better. The food choices were not that much. I definitely think that they could add more items with the price they charged. I will likely not go back to this place in the near future.",

The prime rib was good and the sides were...eclectic?! It isn't the standard buffet you would find on the mainland but it's got something for everyone.  Breakfast buffet is great. They change tthings out so aren't eating the same thing day after day. The POG juice is a must. A lite bit of Hawaiian sweetness to start your day (you can also request it at dinner and the lovely lady's will get you a glass of it).  Overall this was a great place for us during our stay. The lady's were always so sweet and helpful. I won't say the food is spectacular but it's good when you don't want to leave the hotel! Plus the ocean view can't be beat.",

Contents of the buffet can not be expected, but I think that it was the content of prime rib and daily dish. I can not hope for the late time of the scenery. It is in a store with a spacious feel that is common in hotels.

The place sort of does Theme nights.  Tuesday is Italian night, which translates to having 2 pasta dishes, chicken piccata, oxtail Milanese, and Minnestrone soup.  The Italian dishes were ok, the only standout being the Oxtail Milanese served with polenta.  The Prime rib was very tender.  Good quality beef, and much better than normal buffet roast beef.  The buffet also has your regular salad and vegetable sides, along with a nice looking dessert table.  It was an ok dinner for a rainy day unless you are a big meat eater.  It works well when you don\u2019t have to leave the hotel.",

Nearly 80% of the people were there, but it felt like an exhibition space with no layout inside the store, and it made me want to tilt my head to the hotel restaurant. There are only 6 main dishes, and only one of them was delicious. I thought that the prime rib was thin, but it was a good amount for one person. Of course, when I changed it, a good thick slice came out this time. Are you out from the beginning! !! The local beer and salad were delicious. Overall it's not particularly delicious. There are some desserts, but I didn't putt. If you feel like a family restaurant, you may come at half price, but if it's not half price, it's not good.

There was someone always at the grill cooking up any requests I believe. They offered 3 types of juice and I always go the POG juice.  It can get busy and initially I felt that they were kinda \"cold\". I then realized that it is because they are busy.  I understood and I made effort to be a good customer to them with thanks and appreciation.  I felt immediately after that, I felt a shift in communication, even though they were busy.  Kim (who is in the morning) was super nice.  The amount of food was great. The normal cost is $32. The staff do try to keep the place clean by cleaning right after a customer is done.  The dinner menu was pretty good too.",

Usually this is because the food costs much more simply because of convenience. So I decided to walk downstairs to the Kuhio Beach Grill. When I entered I was seated towards the back of the room. Was there something wrong with flip flops, shorts and a t-shirt? This is Waikiki Beach after all... So after some consideration and seeing the full menu I opted for the Wednesday Asian Buffet. I would guess there were over 30 quality items, excluding desserts. I did my best to sample much. I had a salad, a slice of prime rib (very good), Lemon chicken, teriyaki tidbits, steamed rice, fish & a shrimp. then I ordered and drank my first mai tai and had desserts. The regular buffet price is $24.95 monday thru friday. Considering this is an \"All you can eat\" it is very valued. The food is very well prepared, heated and the staff are the friendliest I have met during my week stay. Give it a try, you won't regret it.",

Nothing on the breakfast was below $20 except for the coffee which is a Starbuck's priced $5. Now, as far as the quality... let's just say the $7 bacon was pulled straight from the long sitting buffet. They eggs were the same consistency as pancake batter and the fruit on display can only be described as the equivalent of the bruised parts of the banana that no one wants to eat!  The service.... it was there. Sadly not what you would expect from a restaurant charging 4 star prices.  I've posted the menu to their photos for your view pleasure.",

It's not even worth your time picking it of the meat. The chef gives you a small slice of prime rib and if you go back he'll give you even a smaller slice. The selection of other foods was small. There was fish but they didn't replenish it so I only got a tiny slice and I got there not so late. The soda was about five dollars! And it was filled with lots of ice! The wine glass is barely half filled and that was seven dollars! And it wasn't even expensive wine. And I know my winde. They even add a 15 percent gratuity for a buffet, mind you.",
