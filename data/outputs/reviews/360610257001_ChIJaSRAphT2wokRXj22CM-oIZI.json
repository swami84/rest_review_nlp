There weren't very many guests present, which was the opposite of what I remember seeing there when the location was previously a Mexican restaurant. The vibe here is the complete opposite...quaint and charming. It's the perfect setting for a date or chill but small group dinner. If you are a solo diner the bar may be better unless you prefer to sit at a table in peace with a book and a meal...not a lot of people watching here (at the hour I was there). The food is PERFECT! I am still thinking about the Bucatini! My friends had the pork tenderloin and Garganelli, and we shared the duck fat potatoes...all were fantastic! The only qusestion mark I have is for the drinks...I ordered an Aperol Spritz, but what I received was some other spirit spritz. It was \"ok\" but not Aperol. The server apologized for not mentioning they did not have Aperol. The overall service and food outweighed my disappointment with my drink so I am giving Clay 5 stars! The drink wasn't that bad...I ordered a 2nd. :-)",

They said they weren't taking menu orders for Valentine's Day, but had a Valentine's Day Special they could deliver. I asked about the price, and they said $110. Now, obviously when you're doing a Valentine's Day Special, it's meant for two people, but since my finances are tight I wanted to be sure.  \"$110 total,\" I asked, \"or per person?\" \"No, just $110,\" they told me.  Well, I just got the bill. They charged $110 PER PERSON.  I very specifically asked them about this. It's negligent at best; shamelessly duplicitous at worst.  (Also, $220 for four scallops, two pieces of fish, two pieces of beef, two cookies, and some miscellaneous veggies et cetera is absurd--especially given that the food arrived cold. If you're charging this kind of price, you should at least be sending out your delivery guys with insulated containers. They just used brown paper bags.)",

I had two non-alcoholic drinks: Inner Flight (lemon, honey, chamomile, etc) and Fine and Mellow (with beet juice and soda). Fantastic drinks!! For our appetizers, we ordered the pork belly and the chicken liver pate with toast. Sensacional flavors and presentation. The portions were good enough to share. For my entree, I chose crab with calamarata pasta, which was phenomenal - crab really tasted like crab. My husband ordered the famous confit duck leg, and let me tell you, I never ate a duck so delicious and so crispy like this one. To wrap it up, we ordered as a dessert the yogurt pannacotta. The staff was very attentive and always checking on us. I loved that they did an outside area that was open and cozy at the same time, and I felt safe because it was only 8 tables spread out. My special shout out for one of the managers, Andrea Needell, that gave us a first class service, very nice and fun. I can't wait to go back to Clay's!",

I felt like posting a review because they broke one of my biggest gripes with bad management tonight.  We walked in at 9:40, 20 minutes before listed closing time of the kitchen. They told us it was closed. If you have a listed closing time... Thats when you close. Not before. Thats a sign of poor management, staff, and honesty. Every time I come here, I want to return less.  I used to have great dinners here.",

It is the epitome of a neighborhood spot. Small, warm and cozy where you are greeted like old friends or neighbors. The food is local and seasonal, apparently so is the decor, flatware, and music. This spot has a great vibe and should be in the dinner rotation. For more great review check out The Loupe!",

I'm usually not a French toast girl so I opted for the delicate beet dish instead. My nephew, who'd been to Clay before insisted I try his French toast and man o'man did I regret not ordering my own.  Coffee was fresh brewed. Wine selections pretty solid and service was pleasant. The space is intimate and well designed. Hostess stand, full bar & dimly lit setting suites this place well.  I'd definitely recommend for brunch, evening drinks or date night.  ~Christy",
