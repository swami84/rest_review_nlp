There are different choices at reasonable prices, ranging from meat bowls and vegetables dishes. There is some orders for your reference. The store is not far from the Foggy Bottom station, GW University and the Lincoln. If you are finding something hot to eat, it is a good choice for you to drop in. This is really a good Chinese fast food. The food is delicious and the manager is warm and highly recommended. It feels like a restaurant in the cafeteria of the University of Washington. Many students come to eat, but it is also open to the public. The meals were plenty. Looking at a small bowl, the vegetables and meat were adequate, the prices were fair, and hot water was available. The location is not far from the fog valley subway station or the Lincoln Memorial. I have been planning to use this shop as a base for a week in Washington. I have eaten two meals and have not stepped on the mine.  (Original) The food is amazing! The staff are so nice and friendly! The taste is typical Chinese style, rather than American Chinese food.

Unfortunately it just doesn't taste very good. I had the sweet and sour chicken bowl with chow mein on the proprietors' recommendation and the sauce was cloyingly sweet -- most likely ketchup-based. Whatever noodles that weren't covered in sauce tasted oily and flavorless, like it came out of a ramen packet.  I was so excited that a Chinese food eatery replaced the previously dismal Pita Pit but it looks like this specific retail space is doomed to mediocrity",
