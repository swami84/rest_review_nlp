What makes this place really distinct is the Sushi Chef; he comes from one of the top sushi restaurants in the Copley area, and has the know how that you'll be able to see (and taste). I'll just ask him to put a plate together of what he thinks is best, and I've never been disappointed. Definitely a place for Sushi connoisseurs - but at a much more affordable level. Check it out!",

They also have a complete sushi bar and a variety of other Japanese and Korean entrees.  The owners are extremely friendly and the space is well maintained.  The service is excellent.

I especially loved the uni, the ikura, the sushi boat, the soondoobu chigae and the wide selection of nigiri!  The mouth watering real Korean food at this hidden gem is a refreshing change especially since Massachusetts does not have a lot of decent authentic Korean restaurants compared to LA or Atlanta, so this is my new go to! Also the sushi chef and wait staff are super chill, polite and sweet.  If you want the real stuff we Asians eat and not just another fried rice and egg roll joint, this place is for you. If not, you should still try it because holy cow it's still some of the best you'll find this far North.",

Prior to entrees, a selection of five small appetizer style dishes are presented. Pickled carrots, some sort of potato dish, pickled sprouts?, broccoli, and kimchi; all very good, and totally unexpected. We ordered Crab Rangoon and never received them, so accepted these dishes as our appetizer instead.  For sushi rolls we ordered Goldfish Maki, Angus Beef Tempura Maki, Gold Finger Maki, and Dragon Maki. The Angus Beef Tampura Maki was the standout for the evening, being a VERY different roll from anything I've ever had before. All four rolls were very good and fairly priced compared to other sushi restaurants.",
