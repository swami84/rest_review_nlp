My friends and I paid half card and half cash, when she came back 85% of the bill was literally charged on to my card. All I got was a Cesar wrap and my bill was not more than $15. I don\u2019t know the exact price of the wrap but I know it is not more than that. We asked why so much of the bill was charged on to my card and she said we didn\u2019t give her enough cash. I saw both of my friends put in the exact amount that was needed for their part of the bill. We informed her of this and she told us she counted it 3 times and there was nothing she could do. I am not accusing her of taking the cash for herself but that\u2019s what it seems like. I am very disappointed that I had to pay for more than I should of.",

I had 1 drink, used the rest room and returned to my table and group of friends in the 45 minutes that I was there. The bill came out, which I paid, and was ready to purchase another bottle when I was tapped on the shoulder and asked to come to the door. The door man told me I wasn\u2019t welcome inside because \u201cI was too drunk and racist at the door\u201d.  Being skeptical (as we were with a diverse group and had no problems getting seated an hour ago) I tried explaining that there might have been a misunderstanding as everyone was in costume, and that I take the accusation seriously. I asked to speak to the manager, Kristen, at the time and was told she\u2019s too busy (she was standing at the host booth) and was threatened physically by the door man to leave and that I wasn\u2019t allowed to stand on the sidewalk under the awning while it was pouring rain out. I tried calling the bar, no one answered. I was calm and civil throughout the entire situation. I recommend to spend your hard earned money elsewhere in the city.",

Perfect for an upscale game experience as you wont have to compromise on eating just regular bar food. Great place to take a date who may be reluctant to watch sports. Believe me, everyone will have a great time. We tried the Deviled Eggs with the honey ham on top, which I highly recommend. The grilled chix also good and the Kale Salad, which was fantastic!",

We came here for lunch around 12:30 PM on a Sunday and it was about half full. We were seated right away and and served water within minutes of being seated. The food came out quickly and the service was good. The staff wasn't the most friendly but it didn't bother me. I had the Brussel spout salad and added the tofu. The Tofu was delicious and marinated in some kind of asian dressing but there was only four little pieces - and when I say small I really mean it. For $4 I thought the portion would be a little more. That's really my only complaint about this place, though. The rest of my meal was light and enjoyable. Then menu looked good enough to come back and try something new. I'd return and take friends here to enjoy the ambiance.",

The music was decent, but the only thing I was turned off by were the transitions made by the DJ. I know that's very specific, but when dancing, I like to be able to keep the dance moves and vibes going and the DJ just wasn't doing it for me. Maybe I'll try again on another night.

To cut to why they\u2019ve been given 1 star: I ordered the vegetarian burger which was typed in correctly, however, I was given a lamb burger. I do not eat meat due to health reasons. After a couple of bites, I realized my order was incorrect and told the bar staff. They said I\u2019d get a refund and they also made the vegetarian burger over. I wasn\u2019t feeling too well at that point so I actually handed the burger over to a friend.  Later on that week, I noticed that the refund wasn\u2019t processed on my credit statement. I\u2019ve called this place twice to explain the situation in detail. The first time I was told to text my information and it would be handed over to the manager on duty. The second time, I was told that they would let them know that I called for a status update. It has been two weeks and I still have not heard anything. The lack of follow up is discouraging.",

The decor was so cute & chic. definitely a place to have brunch with the girls. loved that there was no wait for a table. food was delicious! i got the crab cake benedicts. i loved their twist on breakfast potatoes because they use a mix of white, purple and red potatoes.

The steaks were so tiny and not cooked properly. The fries were literally coated in seasoning, and the worst part was the steel oats were the consistency of water and had no seasoning at all  and, served with moldy berries. On top of that the service was very slow. Our food came out separately with about 10 minutes in between each meal. I suggest avoiding this place.",
