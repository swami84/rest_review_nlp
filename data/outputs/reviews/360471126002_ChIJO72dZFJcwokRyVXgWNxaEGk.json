When I appealed to the Manager, Mr. Singh, he raised his voice and refuted what I said as if this was impossible. Never once (he must have missed the class on customer satisfaction) did he attempt to make amends. This in my opinion, is unacceptable from a Managerial and Professional customer service standpoint.  Unless I am contacted formally by headquarters (yes, they were contacted) and this situation rectified, I will seek business elsewhere and tell ALL my friends of the experience. I'm quite influential when I want to be. Besides, you will not and cannot \"successfully\" run a business WITHOUT the consumer so good luck with that one!",
