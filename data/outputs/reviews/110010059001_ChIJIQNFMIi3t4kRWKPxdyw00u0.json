While there are happy hour drinks and appetizers, they are truly average and worst, expensive.  Margaritas or other drinks, really depend on the day, hour, and who makes it for you in at the bar.  Meals, like the Salmon salad, and grilled chicken are truly average in preparation and taste.  The expensive component is because the Hyatt is really at the heart and great location in D.C.   People service is always excellent!  Naturally, the personnel taking care of you do not make those meals or drinks, and they really are attentive to your needs!  However, my recommendation, try a few drinks while meeting people and go around the block, there are very fine places in a brief, nice, walking distance from the hotel.  You will be surprised how a couple of blocks, can make a world of difference in taste in food and drinks!",

The gentleman sent us to a table in the lobby bar area... not a table in the restaurant...with a dessert menu.  No one came over and after quite a while, we\u2019d had enough.  We walked back and handed him the menu and started walking away.  It was only THEN that he offered to seat us in the restaurant and take our order!    I said thanks but too late.   It turns out there\u2019s a Starbucks in the Market store and they were very accommodating!   I\u2019m a Hyatt member (which shouldn\u2019t make a difference) and we\u2019re not kids...in our early 70\u2019s.... but this shouldn\u2019t be how guests or walk-ins are treated!   Is this a Hyatt policy or just a manager who doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. My children live nearby so we\u2019ll be staying at this Hyatt now.

The hotel lobby is pretty and it's a nice space. Right off the bat, something felt off because someone was coming up to the bar because her waiter didn't bother to give her any utensils and the bartender wasn't giving her the time of day. The bartender took a while to acknowledge my presence and didn't seem to speak English very well. I ordered a couple of appetizers and I didn't finish either of them. They both tasted cheap and weren't particularly interesting. I had a couple of beers as well ($8/each). I thought they might do mixed drinks better, so I ordered an old fashioned. It was okay. Not great. They charged me $19 for it though, and that's where they lost me. My total (with tip) was $83. That was not an $83 meal. If I was paying $35 for that meal in Morgantown, WV I'd have no complaints, but for $83 in DC I could've walked across the street and had a better meal.",

The food is decent enough, but absolutely nothing memorable, and the prices are exorbitant (elegant given the quality). The buffet, when offered, is as significant disappointment, even when compared to the on-menu offerings.  That all being said, if what you want is to have a drink or six in the attached bar and hope that someone famous (and their security detail) will come by, you're in luck.

It was bad then and even worse now.  I regret giving them a second chance.  It started out with a $30 round of drinks.  That is one dark and stormy and one glass of red wine (from a $30 retail bottle), both served in 4oz. plastic tumblers.  The wine was obviously corked and had also sat opened way to long from the strong vinegar smell and taste.  We complained about the wine and it was replaced, but it still showed up on our check and they would not remove when we complained.  So really it was a $45 round of drinks!  There was no bar service from the table.  Soda and water only.  If we wanted wine with the meal, we had to elbow our way across the lobby and get it ourselves.  The water was splashed in equal measure into our glasses and across the table into our laps without care or apology.  That is after the empty water glasses were slammed onto the table rudely interrupting our conversation.  The bread arrived, which was by far the highlight of the evening.  I ordered the buffet while my dining companion order a entree salad and the calamari appetizer.  I chose to hold off on hitting the buffet so we could eat together.  Surprising, but the app and the entree arrived at the same time, so after sharing the app, my companion was almost completely done before I even got to the buffet.  Horrible timing, especially when they attempted to bus our table and take the remaining app and bread while we were still eating it, forks in hand.  And the buffet; unseasoned, flavorless, dry, uninspired... Shall I go on?  Caesar salad but no croutons, roast beast (beef I hope) cooked to a leathery texture and served in a flavorless gravy swimming in fat, turkey breast and stuffing lacking in any glaze, seasonings, or natural flavor.  The side pastas were overcooked and unsauced.  Total for the evening was $120 plus tax and tip for two diners.  I had pizza latter that night to get the bad taste out of my mouth.  Just stay away and walk a block to any of 20 restaurants available to you in the neighborhood.  The food court at Union Station would serve you better.",

Not only for the ease and proximity (located in the lobby of the hotel), but also because the food and service are very good.  I had the opportunity to eat several meals here during my stay at the Hyatt, and was pleased with each meal.  The rib eye was excellent as well as their cobb salad and breakfast buffet.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and feel it exceeds the level of other choices close by.",

But the reason this place got 2-Star rating is because of the guy that seats people. Older grumpy guy who gives everyone the stink eye, including the wait staff. Speaks curtly and rudely to diners and bosses around staff in front of customers. Really unpleasant to be around.",
