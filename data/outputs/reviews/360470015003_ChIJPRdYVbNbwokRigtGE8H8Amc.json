New staff is impatient and doesn't know the menu off hand... Not the best customer service.  But back to the food, they do get 5/5. The patacon doesn't taste like it's been cooked in old oil like most places. The cheese is fresh, they aren't cheap with the meat or avocado either. It is pricey for a typical patacon but it's the most affordable thing in DeKalb market.",
