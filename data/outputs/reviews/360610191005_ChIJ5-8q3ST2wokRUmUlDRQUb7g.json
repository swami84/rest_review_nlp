After waiting for about 10 minutes,  we were allowed to come in and order.  The gentleman at the counter said only what you see if what available (they were out of 3 pies, including pepperoni). He said you can not wait for the ones that are out.  We wanted to try their famous pepperoni square so we ordered a whole pie and a slice of vodka.  Was told the pie would take 35-45 minutes.   After waiting for over an hour, we finally got our pie.  Not sure what took them so long as we stood their and waited for it and they were not busy, we ordered at 4pm.  I will start by saying their vodka slice was delicious! Definitely well worth it and get what the hype is all about.  Unfortunately, we can not say that about the pepperoni pie.  We both love salt, but the pie was so salty it was almost inedible.   Each layer added another layer of salt.  We tried the cheese and sauce separately and our mouth was loaded with salt. We wanted to like it so much but after 2 slices we had to stop eating it.  Even after waking up this morning, we have been drinking so much water to flush the salt out.  As much as I would like to reccomend them,  I can not because of how salt it was.",

Knowing the wait for the pizza will be long from past reviewers, I went around 4 PM on a Saturday, waited only 10 minutes to order a slice and a pie to go. Upon ordering, I was told they are out of a few of their most well known options and cannot even order those knowing they will eventually have fresh available. I ordered one vodka slice and a pepperoni pie. The slice was immediately handed to us, this slice was indeed delicious, vodka sauce fresh with fresh basil on top. The pie I was told would take 30-45 minutes. I waited an hour total for the pie. The pie was so salty that I was in disbelief. Not only the pepperoni was salty, the cheese and the sauce was loaded. Being a salt lover, this was too much. My fiance and I could not even eat half of the pie. The crust was okay, the pizza as a whole was just so heavy and salty that I will not be back unfortunately.",

I am not a rude person (most people generally say I am sweet...so I am speechless as to the whole ordeal). :(  And I am not going to use their online system. Too many reviews below indicate trouble (whether it be hours for their pizza to arrive....or simply not arriving and a possible double charge)?  I usually never leave reviews (and wouldn't waste my time leaving a negative review) but after my experience last night, felt it was important to do so. Please if the owner is reading this, learn how to treat customers with respect and if possible, make more pies at key demand periods. It is not that difficult.",

But their service couldn't be any more deplorable.  I visited for the first time on March 22nd, 2021 at 7:28 PM. I wanted to place an order for three Cacio E Pepe slices, two Vodka slices, two Angry Nonna's, and one Poached Pear. Upon ordering the two vodka slices, I was told \"you only order what is over there!\" as she gestured at the spread of pies on their table. Unfortunately, given COVID guidelines, it was difficult to discern how many slices of vodka were left, and so I asked \"how many vodkas do you have left? It's difficult to see from here\" to reaffirm that there really was only one and not two. This was responded with another \"you can only order what's over there\".  This interaction left a bad taste in my mouth but I understand - sometimes it's hard to maintain a positive attitude in the service industry during a pandemic. But the reason for two stars is, upon relaying this story to my roommate, he told me he had an incredibly similar experience. Once is a bad day, twice is a pattern.  In addition, is it so ridiculous for one to assume that there will be more slices made at 7:30 pm? The dinner rush has just finished and dinner service continues for at least a few more hours, will more pies not be made? Is it too much to see when the next vodka slice will be available?

We checked in 2x via email. Close to 9pm, as it was 3 hours late, we e-mailed again to cancel and received a phone call that there was a problem with the ordering system. Someone was supposed to reach out to us in the next few days. To our knowledge, no one has contacted us in the last week.  While the pizza was good the first time, it seems that extremely untimely orders are a norm and it's not worth waiting/not knowing if your order will ever be ready. We'd be willing to try it again if we were walking by one day and there wasn't a line, but we won't be ordering anymore.",

Once I got the confirmation email stating that my order will be ready in 60 minutes I was shocked, I tried so many good pizzas in New York but not even once have I had to  wait this long, so I decided to go and ask if this was realistic. I went to the \"online pickup\" and waited for at least 10 minutes, while the host or attendant was taking orders from the people that were in the \"order now\" line. After 3 or four people, he came to the side that I was standing and ignoring me completely, He started talking to a young lady that just arrived...I asked for permission and explained in a very respectful way that I was waiting before her and that I just need to confirm if the waiting time in my confirmation email was right, the attendant didn't even let me finish what I was saying when he said with a very rude and disrespectfull attitude \"I'm talking to a customer, you have to wait\", I decided to step back and not start a confrontation, it wasn't worth it, but when he finally finished with the lady, he just returned to take more new orders from the other line...I told him again, in the same respectful way, what was my question, and he replied with big open eyes and very rude tone \"YES\". I decided to go and come back, I tried to cancel the order, but I couldn't cancel it online so I came back an hour later to pickup the pizza. I went again to the same \"pickup place\" wait for the person in front of me to be attended and when it was my turn he went back to the \"taking orders\" line, that was with 2 people, took their orders and then went back to the store, picked up some slices and give it to a person that was by my side. After that he went back to the store, no one was in the other line, and he stayed there looking at me and talking to one of the pizza makers, he didn't even ask my name or my confirmation email to get my order, the pizza maker was the one who decided to come with the pizza box with my name on it...what a frustrating and disappointing experience. I understand that you are struggling with many people ordering and answering phone calls at the same time, but that doesn't give you any right to treat a customer so rude and disrespectful, specially if that customer treated you with respect. I'LL NEVER COME BACK.",

Love the range of options, some of which were incredibly unique (Poached Pear w sweet Gorgonzola and hot honey, Cacio e Pepe).  Every pizza place should be able to nail their plain slice above all else, and Mama's Too's house slice was excellent. There was a coal fired feel to it, especially on the crust, but the slice was thin and crispy too. Whatever sauce they've got behind the counter has something to it that makes it sweet and rich.  When we arrived, they were only taking orders for what was out on the counter albeit a limited selection (half of a house pie, one square of poached pear, two squares of caramelized onion and mushroom). The guy behind the counter (very nice guy and hard working btw) said we could wait 5-15 for new pies to be put out, but he wouldn't say what was cooking. That would have been nice to know to help make a decision in terms of ordering what was out versus waiting. The process was a bit confusing, and the availability is a roll of the dice (a good sign though that the food is great).  Delicious pizza though, overall. Highly recommended if near the UWS!",

There\u2019s an assortment of pizza to pick from but you must try, the House Slice. It is a traditional round pie. The crust is light and airy with a crunch. The sauce is the perfect mixture of sweet and seasoned perfectly and the cheese melted golden brown.  There were many square slices to pick from to include, pepperoni (Detroit Style) poached pear, caramelized onion, vodka with whipped ricotta, and spinach with ricotta. I had the pepperoni which would look burnt to most but the cheese was cooked into the crust which added to the crisp and crunchy flavor of the crust. The cheese also had a slight char to it with the added flavor of the fat from the charred pepperoni cooked into the cheese provided an excellent combination of flavor. I also tried the spinach and ricotta which was good as well but was nowhere near as good as the pepperoni.  The house slice will run you $4 and the square slices are $5. Minimum of $10 for credit card payment.  This place would be quite nice in the summer since it has a garage door at the front. Or take the slices just a few blocks over to Central Park for a pizza picnic. They provide takeout if you prefer not to wait in line or have it delivered with one of the popular apps.  The experience was excellent but there was no hot peppers, Parmesan Cheese, garlic powder, nor Italian Seasoning. You\u2019ll also have to find a bathroom elsewhere since they didn\u2019t have one. The service is also on the rude side.",

I found this bizarre to say the least. In hindsight, why didn\u2019t the cashier just tell me to wait 10 minutes and charge me then?",

On other occasions, the specialty pies maybe haven\u2019t been battle-tested and come out bland or way too wet. At the very least, make sure your slice is hot in the center when you get it.

Finally the other cashier had to come and look up our payment in the register before they realized we were telling the truth. All the while they were extremely rude and never even considered that they might be in the wrong. The fact that the cashier had to literally have the other guy go though the cash register to verify our receipt before considering that he MIGHT be wrong is insane. And to make things worse, there was a long line of exhasperated customers that this ordeal held up. At least the customers behind us were kind and sympathetic and knew we were right in this situation.  It's unfortunate. We liked the place before this happened. They need to clean up their act and treat people with respect. They have lost our business and we no longer refer friends here.",

        "caption": "Yeah, I'm back to update, 9/9/19. After staying away as I said I would, I came back a few times lately. Frank seems to be getting back to normal, he has let go of some of his arrogance. Most of the time the house slice is how it should be (perfection), but every now and then (25% of the time), it still has a burnt taste, which is a shame. Two new square slices are the spinach with ricotta and upside down slice. Both great, the upside down is amazing. Still surly service from the short guy with the Mr. Magoo glasses who just itches for an argument with anyone who ask anything. Get the house slice right all the time and get Mr. Magoo to act like a normal person, and this place would be incredible.{FINI} ---- Unfortunately, today, 3/22/19, I have had to revise my rating and review for what was once a truly incredible pizza place. Before the now legendary NYT review came out, the cheese slice (called a house slice by the owner and employees), was fantastic. Sometimes a bit less cheese than what should be on the slice, but still, a wonderful piece of pizza, the dough was cooked perfectly and was simply heavenly. The owner, Frank, took great pride and care to making sure exactly how long to leave the pie in the oven to cook, as he was the main pizza maker. Now, since the NYT review, Frank is no longer a pizza maker, but an \"instagram maker\", where he is constantly busy trying to promote his store. Now for the last few months, every time, yes, every time I get some house slices, they are always burnt. Sometimes burnt horribly where it is inedible, sometimes lightly burnt, but still, burnt, and that burnt flavor just overpowers everything else. I've seen others complain of this problem, and Frank defensively replies that this is the custom of his pizza place, to have it with a bit of \"char\". It's nonsense of course, it's just due to the guys he has making the pizza now. So, I'm done with the house slice here, as I've given them too many chances to get the quality under control, and it's just not happening. Instead of one star, I'm giving two, as their square slices, which are made entirely different that the house slice (these are thick and oily), are of the same quality as when they opened, and the mushroom/onion and pear/gorgonzola are still excellent. But what was the star of this place (and why the NYT gave them such a glowing review), the light, airy, heavenly house slice, is now a burnt slice, and I won't return to be disappointed yet again for at least a few months, even though I live right around the corner. Another reason I won't be back for a long time is Frank has changed, his new found fame seems to have gone to his head. I've seen him ignore people on line wanting to order something when a friend of his pops by, and he talks to his friend for the next 15 or 20 minutes (I've seen this happen a few times). He comes off as arrogant and obnoxious. I remember when I was the only customer in the store and he was so grateful and kind to new customers, but that's in the past, and he is a \"star\" now. It's really sad how he has changed, but, it is what it is.",

They open at 12 (noon) which is inconvenient compared to other pizzerias that open for lunch at 11 or 1130, but worse is that they always open late. It wastes your time and creates long lines. Waiting times can be hit and miss at other times of the day. The employees have ranged from amiable to rude. Pie pie pizza is cheaper, faster, has better customer service, and the pizza is almost as good.  *edited my comment for clarity in light of the below response. As a side note, the fact that management responded to my review and used 12 question marks in their post is indicative of their customer service- oddly rude and unprofessional. For what it's worth, I visited a couple days ago and they opened late again. My wife and I left at 12:20 - they still weren't ready for business. They have delicious pizza just sometimes not worth it.",

        "caption": "I live right around the corner and come here often. The pizza can be very good, if your slice isn't burnt. But I found a strategy-- I point out the slice that I want. It might take a few tries, since they'll not hear you, not understand what pointing is, or randomly try to give another slice, but just repeat slower and louder! S-l-o-w-e-r and LOUDER.  But you shouldn't come for the pizza. Oh no baby. You should come (as I do) for the incredible, spectacular show that is the world's most hilariously incompetent and halfwitted service. Not ONCE haven't I been deeply entertained by some of the stupidest, most arrogant and clueless customer management I have ever witnessed! It's a show people, grab your tickets!  The star performers are Big Guy (who may be the owner) and a shorter glasses wearing fellow, who I'll dub George because of his similarity to the Seinfield character.  Episode 1- customer buys 2 slices that comes out to 9 bucks, and takes out a credit card. \"10 dollar minimum!!\" shrieks George like an infant. \"Well.. is there anything I could buy for a dollar?\" the customer asks politely. There are literally cans of coke and water on the shelf nearby which would get him over the minimum. \"NOTHING!!\" George yells. Everyone stares. The customer panicks, and leaves the store. Now get this- George has the nerve to turn to the next customer and say \"Don't worry, don't worry, I'm ok- I deal with these kinds of people all the time!\" I almost spat out my water, I applauded, encore!! Where else can you get entertainment like this?  Scene 2- an Italian couple (a legimitate ITALIAN couple from Italy, the country that originated pizza) enters the store. Our amici from the terra vecchia wanna try some good ol' New York pizza. Fellas didn't know they're getting the show combo. Luigi gingerly asks what was on a slice (it ain't what they have in Italy, so a man wants to know) and George just LEERS, staring him down like he disrespected his Mamma. Luigi asks again, and George screams back \"Pepperoni!!\" Ah, poor Luigi, he didn't know that one does not simply ask what's on a pizza at Mamma's too, unless you want to be verbally abused! Luigi didn't understand because of the American accent, and had the nerve to ask again, and is now plucking strings with Dante in the inferno (at least it's hot and they can make some good pizza down there. I wonder if they ever burn it??)  The stories go on and on. Once George tried to double charge me, and yelled at me! Delightful. I had to use my Dora-the-Explorer voice to explain that I ordered 3 slices (one, two, three! Let's count together!) at which point he just walked off confusedly. No pizza in the store? Enjoy Big Guy tell you to get out! It's an hour wait, chumps!  The comments keep suggesting they get customer service classes, but I'm thoroughly convinced they are entirely incapable of mentally comprehending the concept. Rather, they gotta EMBRACE what they got. Sell the slapstick comedy, charge 'em admission. Mamma's TOO- where you TOO will be yelling- \"Mamma mia!!\"",

The only problem I have is that the place needs better stocking of their pizza. When one has to wait almost an hour for a few slices, that's bad. Obviously, they may need an extra pizza maker.

We had the Bada Bing pizza and it was greasy and delicious but really had to work the jaw to bite thru the dough.  The circle pizza uses more traditional dough.  90 minute wait for online pick up order during lunch time, makes for a later than anticipated meal. It was really busy when we got there as well and the line went out the door, though given the small size inside it was not too long a wait.",
