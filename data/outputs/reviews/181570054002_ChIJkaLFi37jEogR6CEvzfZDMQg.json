I've been to restaurants from the Midwest, to New York City, to LA, Miami, and Vegas. Cheap restaurants and expensive restaurants. But I can say this without reservation: Their Wagyu Burger was truly the best burger I had ever had in my lifetime. And I'm a hamburger guy. I truly could not believe it when I bit into that burger. I can't tell you just how badly you need to try that thing. The atmosphere was so peaceful, calming, yet still fun. The lighting was wonderful. It's in a great location. The food is amazing. And the staff were so nice and went out of their way to help. West Lafayette needed more sit down and eat places, and this might just be the best one in town. But it certainly has the best Burger.",

Mushroom Bolognese tasted very little of mushrooms but of a cup of sugar instead, similar to the sweetness of SpaghettiOs when I was a child.  The steak was fantastic.  I could not say a bad word until the bill.  Entrees at 8Eleven range from $18-$48.  Imagine my surprise when I received a bill for a $140 steak.  Never a warning by the server as to the price of the special before it was ordered.  I bear joint responsibility for not asking, however I will not dine there again, unless someone else is buying.  Warning to others, ask the price of the special(s)!",

Loved the ambience - not too noisy, mood lighting, decor is gorgeous! The bar and restaurant area are separate. There is also a place to to grab coffee/snacks if that's all you're in the mood for.  We tried the following from their dinner menu: 1) Burrata Cheese with apricot mostarda, truffle honey, marcona almond, grilled rustic bread. The combination of the cheese + apricot is delicious! 2) Shoestring fries 3) Wild Mushroom Bolognese - I really enjoyed this dish. Not usually one to go for pasta, but this was definitely worth it. Very flavourful. 4) Mille feuille - very tasty. The pastry was a little drier than what I'm used to, but I'd still recommend it.  Portions are good. We shared the above between two people.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there aren't a lot (if at all any) vegetarian or vegan options on the menu, except for some salad and side items.",

Since the hour was later, we chose to head into West Lafayette for dinner and opted to stay the night instead. So thankful we did just that, and we found 8Eleven Bistro. The food was some of the very best we have had in the 25+ years of our happy marriage that has taken us to over 40 states. The food is THAT good! Thank you so much for the welcome we received, the crab croquettes , the delectable crunchy fresh salads, and the memorable braised beef and pan seared chicken, to the magical Key Lime Pie. It was all world-class, first-rate, five-star worthy: however you wish to classify some of the best food you can find anywhere. Love this place and will be back again!",

Not only were the staff very friendly and attentive, but I also felt very comfortable, which can be difficult to achieve during COVID-19. The warmly lit environment took their bourbon display to the next level; providing that classic aesthetic that could fool you into thinking you were in Louisville or Nashville.  I highly recommend the burrata cheese appetizer and the bread pudding; they were absolutely delicious. If you like seafood then definitely order the scallops, but if that's not your style, the menu has a variety of other enticing options. As 8Eleven Bistro evolves, I would love to see more vegetarian entr\u00e9es on the dinner menu. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to my return, and I highly recommend 8Eleven to everybody!",

The historical lime arches, the stained glass windows and the original wood panels have been preserved in the most tasteful way for this eminent five-star restaurant. The warm leather, and the soft aroma of it, combined with contemporary fixtures and dropped curved wooden ceiling beams modernized this space in such a wonderful way while keeping the character of rich history. The ambiance at the adjacent Boiler Up bar matched the awe we felt at 8Eleven.  And the FOOD! The feature this night was Steak Oscar with the most tender, center-cut filet cooked to perfection, the freshest crab in generous portion and house made creamy hollandaise served on tender, not stringy, asparagus. All 4 of us who ordered this agreed we have never had better!  Our server, Aaron, was an attentive consummate professional who catered to our every need and left us wanting for nothing.  There is no better place to create a special memory, as we were doing for my son's 21st birthday.  The renovations were worth the wait! I told my husband I am glad we got to experience it now because when the word gets out, we'll be hard pressed to ever get a table again.  Worth every penny!",

The mushroom and spinach egg white omelet was incredible and paired with one of their specialty brunch drinks was spectacular.  (The sunrise if any of you are curious).  Additionally the wait staff has always been very kind, very knowledgeable about a variety of topics and understanding. I had Grace as my server and she was a class act. I would absolutely recommend that you request her when making a reservation.  While I wish they had a couple more options for vegetarians/alternative ways to make other dishes vegetarian, the options the have are nothing divine. I would 100% recommend coming here for a weekend brunch. An excellent experience.",

If your son or daughter happens to attend Purdue you absolutely must take them here the next time you visit. We ordered Gulf Shrimp Cocktail, Roasted Bone Marrow and Grilled Tuna Nicoise as appetizers. Deliciously impressive, especially the bone marrow which was a new discovery for us. Main courses were Braised Beef and Truffled Spaghetti. The beef was amazing, but the real surprise were the Spaghetti. I am born and raised in Italy, so I have very high standards when it comes to pasta and this dish was absolutely perfect. It was like being in a restaurant back in Rome. Really. Desserts were Mille Feuille and Profiteroles. Do not order the Mille Feuille, otherwise you will ask for two more. You have been warned. Profiteroles too were out of this world. You absolutely have to try this place. You won't regret it. Ah, one more thing....I really enjoyed their 8 Eleven Signature drink. One-of-a-kind for my taste.",
