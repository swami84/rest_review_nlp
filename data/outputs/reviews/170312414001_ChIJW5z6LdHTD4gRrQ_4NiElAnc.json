I had reservations about trying a mock seafood dish because I don\u2019t eat seafood and the smell is overpowering to me. But I went all in for this experience, and ordered the tofu fish and chips. WOW!!! I LOVED IT!!! The tofu was crispy and the sauce was perfect. They even had lemon and vinegar to go with. So so so delicious!!!! We also ordered the nachos. All of it was too much food! The crema on the nachos was really good. The decor in here is on another level. I truly enjoy tiki decorated places and this took it to a new standard. The bathrooms are so cool!! Sharks sticking out on the walls and shark movies playing on loop! So funny! You are doing yourself a disservice, if you don\u2019t dine here. This is one of my all time favorite restaurants!!!",

Grab a menu and determine what you'd like (or already have items chosen from your search on the interwebs), the staff is really great with helping select items from their menu that suit your preferences. I brought mom because she loves a Bloody Mary and theirs are listed as some of the best you can get in Chicago (not surprisingly as they're Vegan, they would have the market cornered on everyone's favorite veggie cocktail too). We ordered a half and half of the buffalo and sesame ginger cauliflower wings...so good we forgot to take a photo prior to clearing the plate. Mom ordered the chili relleno and I ordered the breakfast hash/bowl both were full of fresh whole produce and spices, but so flavorful that my omnivore mama said she could go vegan if she could eat like this all the time! It was so good, she even complimented the chef and staff on our way out. So, we know she'll definitely find her way back before I come to visit again; we loved it, something for everyone's taste buds truly.",

My omnivore dining partner was delighted.  I also have to add that for counter style service, it was excellent service. Someone from the staff checked on us a couple of times throughout our meal to make sure everything was just right.  The ambience is really nice as well. The music was quite enjoyable and added a nice feel to the place, without being too loud to enjoy your meal or have a conversation. I also love the beachy feel of the decorations. It made a cold Chicago night feel a little warmer.  10/10 will return!!",

Prices are also super steep, but kind of worth it at least on special occasions. I recommend the Painkiller (coconut, pineapple, and rum cocktail slash smoothie) and the Mac n cheese balls.

It had good flavor, but wasn't 100% a great vegan rendition. Benedict: very underseasoned. Not good. We barely ate half of it. Buffalo Cauliflower: DELICIOUS. I would go back for this for sure! Chili Relleno: my first dish wasn't cooked properly (raw flower under the fried pepper). They remade my plate, and with a little less vegan cheese, I'd say this is definitely one of my favorite vegan eats in Chicago. The service was great. And the decor is pretty snazzy.  There are some hit and misses, but I'd say the apps and service are on point!",

I had the Buffalo \"Chicken\" Sandwich (not real chicken), and it blew away over 90% of real chicken sandwiches out there-- not to mention it's way healthier for you, there's no chicken raised in a tiny cage, and you're lowering CO2 emissions and land pollution by making this choice.  If you are curious about trying vegan food, check out this place for sure.  My sandwich was absolutely awesome-- it was filling (the equivalent of two sandwiches at a fast food place) and full of flavor.  Very fresh tasting and good quality, and the fries with it were great.  Price was the same as a regular chicken sandwich.  They have sandwiches, salads,  appetizers, and the cocktails were tropical type and looked impressive.  Great beach type decor on the walls and ceiling.  Tables/chairs nice and plenty of space.  Good mix of healthy vegan bowls/salads and sandwiches that imitate common American staples like Fish and Chips and Burgers.  This restaurant is based in Seattle/Portland and the Chicago location is new.",

We started off strong with the nachos, very good with an authentic flare. The other standout was the french toast. It was delicious!  The other four things we ordered were almost not worth eating. We were super underwhelmed by the chowder. The breakfast bowl was a soupy salty mess and the tempeh was almost inedible. We also ordered the Tai Iced Tea and it tasted like cardboard flavored water. We walked around the area looking for a dessert, but came back to try the milkshake, but I requested it to be just a plain vanilla shake, and got a glass of ice, some kind of milk, and mint for $10. To be safe we also ordered a piece of the cake which of course was stale. So $20 gone down the drain. I really wanted to like this place, that's why we ordered so many different things, but we will not be returning.",

Also for the entree, I would recommend the Poke bowl. Serving is huge so 2 people can share it. Also the northwest nachos is good. The chips are the bomb. For drinks, the Thai Iced Tea is so good and also sugarfree. And if you wanna try something new to drink, try out their Shark Shots. It's cute and it will surprise you.",

When you enter, there is a short line where you order your food and drinks at a counter. Then you sit and they serve you.. So, at first, my expectations were not high. I was very wrong. It was great.  The food is all vegan. If you have not had vegan food before, in most cases you won't be able to tell the difference. Since we went for appetizers and drinks, we had only a few items. They were all delicious.  The experience ordering from the counter - we were greeted and they explained how their system worked. The person who took our order was also the bartender. The drinks were prepared while we ordered.  We only had their Eggplant Sticks, which were reminiscent of Mozzarella sticks and their wings (cauliflower, half with buffalo sauce and half with a sesame sauce). As for drinks, we had a variety. My son and I each had Mai Tais - they were different than what I expected in a pleasant way. They add bitters, normally not a part of a Mai Tai. We also had a Pina Colada at the table, and a few other drinks I don't recall. The presentation is outstanding (see the pictures I posted).  My belief is this - the space is fairly small with perhaps 20 tables. I think that once discovered, they will rapidly outgrow this location and either have to knock out a wall, find a larger space, or open another location.  Cheers to the No Bones Beach Club. We'll definitely be back.",

Not only does No Bones Beach Clubdo it perfectly, but the tectures and flavor combinations are so good we mostly ate in silence and moaned the whole time even in the car ride home.  As someone who likes to do gourmet vegan at home, they now have a fan and I plan on telling all my clients and friends about No Bones Beach Club.  Finally I can have dessert when I go out to dinner.

My favorite drink would be the Pi\u00f1a Colada, as you hardly tasted the alcohol - until you get to the bottom of the glass, though some may prefer it that way. Either way, I'm in love!

I get that it\u2019s counter serve but we ordered our cocktails and our cashier made them immediately while we waited patiently to order the rest of our food. Then the plates and box of silverware and napkins crowded our tiny table and the servers fumbled the plates they were clearing. Another concern is that the door doesn\u2019t close fully on its own, which seems small but makes a difference in the winter in Chicago. Finally it would be nice to see some dessert options on the menu. I saw some on instagram but didn\u2019t get the chance to order any! I would for sure come back. I know this is a brand new restaurant and I hope they can get their process down so that they can become a Wicker Park fixture because the food is truly outstanding!",

The staff made it more pleasant by taking drink orders in the line since most of us were standing for 20-30 minutes waiting for tables to empty. My only complaint is that even when tables had cleared, the staff moved too slowly to take orders and seat people. Nothing is more aggravating than being hungry and waiting to eat when you can see three empty tables. So, they have to get a better handle on pacing their order lines. Once we ordered and got seated, the food came out remarkably quickly and was hot and delicious. Will definitely go back, just not 6:30 pm on a Saturday night. Vegan Fish & Chip with Old Bay fries was great and filling.",
