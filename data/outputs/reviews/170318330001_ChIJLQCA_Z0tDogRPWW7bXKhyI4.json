Very excellent service and I like how they brought over the Canadian practice of running your credit card from a device right at your table. The original ramen, which uses a tonkotsu broth, was creamy rich and delicious. Thick noodles were a good compliment. They go light on the toppings, which you mostly have to add on extra and can get pricey from a $12 base. But no complaints since the noodle and broth themselves were so good. Added gyoza and a Coke for another $4. Not cheap overall but also not too unusual for a good Chicago place. Probably one of the best ramen places in Chicago downtown area! $2 sapporo drafts and 1/2 off apps for happy hour - might go back for that!",

The ambience of the place is pretty good and the music is great if you like hip hop. The ramen itself it\u2019s pretty tasty. I got spicy garlic pork ramen. The flavors were pretty well blended and the thick noodles were fresh.  I will say that they could work on the quality of the cuts of meet that are included in the ramen bowl. It seems also like an after thought.  I had a Sapporo beef which was $2 for happy hour that was fresh and crisp.  I will definitely come back here for ramen; a top three spot for sure. And I would recommend it as a good first ever spot to try if you have never had ramen. Cheers!",

Driving downtown and after finishing some errand we decided to drive to the west loop since it's nearby and try-finally this restaurant.  When we walked it was actually empty, that was ok for us because we're hungry. First impressions were actually wow this place looks beautiful and very trendy, I'm sure prices will be high since it's new and it was in the heart of the west loop. My hubby and I looked at the menu and prices were actually affordable, $11 for ramen can't beat that.  I got the normal Miso ramen \ud83c\udf5c and hubby the spicy garlic one. For 4 dollars more you could upgrade the plate to add an appetizer, we got small spicy chicken ( karaage chicken)  and also fry octopus balls (takoyaki). While waiting for the food we got first the appetizers which they were delicious and then at 4 pm the happy hour starts so we got both $2 dollars Sapporo beers super cold, the way should be. Finally, our Ramen bowls arrived and wow they were actually great and very good portion. In the beginning, I saw the size of the bowl and I thought it was too small but we actually couldn\u2019t even finish, we were so full. I generally don't give 5 stars to a restaurant because there\u2019s always room for improvement but this one earned it, we had such a great time there and our server was such a sweetheart, I wish I could remember her name to also add it on this review. Now that winter it\u2019s almost here, this is the place to visit for some amazing Japanese food, highly recommended.",

Best ramen in Chicago by far! Broth was flavorful and the noodles were chewy. We had takoyaki for appetizers. My only issue was that it did not have that much octopus in it.But nonetheless good. So happy we finally have a good ramen place to eat in here. Staff were also very attentive and nice.Please open more branches in the south suburbs so we don\u2019t have to travel far to dine in.",
