Entering the place, which was pretty empty, it took us calling out to the bartender for a waiter to seat us. The decor was nice and fitted the French Bistro format. We ordered an appetizer of warm brie. We specifically asked that it come out before the meal. It came out with the meal. It was good, but it was a toss up of what I wanted to go cold. I ordered a ribeye steak, rare. It was cooked rare on one side and well for about 2/3rds of the steak. The frites were pre packaged frozen French fries, either that or they did a very good job of replicating the taste and texture of such. Bottle of wine was 40 dollars. Had the original price tag of 15 dollars still on the bottle. Overall the meal was very overpriced and poorly executed. I would not recommend going here for dinner.",

Agsin, not enough bread. The Oslo bucco fell short from resembling the deliciousness of the photo shown....no bones or marrow ...jus 3 small pieces of soft meat. Nothing too special for the price. The risotto was good. Didnt ...like that we were given small skinny glasses for our old world french red we bought ....no goblets? \"No, only for our wine off the menu'' we were told. What the hell?! I would have much rather understood that they were short glassware due to their busy parties. Not that we were essentially 'downgraded glass- patrons' becuz we decided to get wine from their wine store nxt door. Not to mention that he took our wine to open it for us and didnt bring us our cork. The tried to gives some other cork that didnt fit; as we decided we'd bring the rest home to enjoy in more appropriate glasses. The outdoor seating is all that was available to dine, which was fine but realized a table cloth or more established table settings would have been more appealing & appreciated. It certainly would have felt better paying the over priced costs for the meal & blended with the serene outdoor atmosphere of mini lights & mini waterfall.",
