I called again at 9:40 they clarified address and said that they did not have shrimp, representative (his name is Silbio) was very sorry, he said they very messed up, that they will return my money, but I should call tomorrow and they will deliver today my food as per courtesy. So, I called on Saturday (it was 5:48), ask if they would deliver my food, rep., vas very rude, he said that they called me and they left message (there was not any voice message). He hang up. They lied that delivery guy on his way, they could check my address in fact when I called first time at 9:14pm, but they most likely provided standard answer for everybody (delivery guy on his way). This is very bad, this is how they treat their customers. Please, don't go there.",
