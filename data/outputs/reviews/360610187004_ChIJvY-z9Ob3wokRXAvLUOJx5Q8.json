But! 5 out of 10 times ordering the beef short ribs by the pound, I swear half pound of it comes in the form of fat. Its so fatty! I dont understand why they didnt use the fatty part for the platter options where they sliced up the ribs so they can discard the fat. Today I got the most fatty beef short ribs of all time and ruin my dining experience. Its inedible and when I tried to separate the meat and the congeal fat, the liquid fat were dripping all over my table. I would go again though, cause its just around the corner of my house and with the pandemic, it is very convenient.",

The main reason behind a less than excellent rating is due to the actual process of getting the food. I understand it\u2019s take out only at this time but there is absolutely no process in place to manage efficient and seamless pick up. There is a tony shelf for ready food and no clear identifier what item is for what order. The hostess was being super nice but it seemed chaotic on people ordering, phoning, sorting out orders and knowing even when the order is ready? One man in the line got so frustrated he walked out and didn\u2019t order. No one even knew where to stand and one lady was not happy being close to someone near her.  I hope this feedback is helpful to find a better system as the current one will turn customers away. And the food is good to come back for.",

At any other  time,  there would be so much more interest in checking this place out.    That being said,  I stopped in for lunch last week to support this fairly new establishment.    The restaurant had just opened,  and there was a small crowd eagerly waiting to order.     Good menu,  and quite reasonably priced.  I ordered the half rack of ribs,  and the brisket platter with mac and cheese,  and baked beans.       The meat was perfectly smoked and mac and cheese was good.   But the absolute winner was the baked beans!!     Sweet and smoky,  with great flavor and perfectly cooked beans.     The brisket was flavorful and moist,  but more crumbled than sliced.   The one downfall was the BBQ sauce,  which is thankfully offered on the side.       It tasted more like the base of a pot of chili than anything else.   Was not good and completely ruined the great smoke flavor of the meat!        And I was not offered bread (I had to ask),  which is a staple at most BBQ restaurants.    But, with time,  both are easily remedied.     The staff was friendly  and courteous,  and I will definitely be back.      I truly wish this place success,  as it is much needed in the neighborhood.",
