        "caption": "Favorite restaurant of all time! I have spent almost every birthday at Yamato, enjoying a delicious Singapore noodle bento-box and at least 8 pieces of gyoza at every meal. My entire childhood was spent at this incredible restaurant, from graduation lunches to holidays to dim sum dinners, and I will never forget the first time I walked through those glass doors (I have so many cartoons that I drew while waiting for food on the chopstick holders they give you)! Impeccable service, and Peter is such an incredible person. If you are ever in the area, I most certainly recommend that you visit! I even have friends who have told me that they had some of the best food they have ever had here. Patio is gorgeous too, and the restaurant\u2019s overall aesthetic is sleek and modern (especially with the beautiful mirrors and woven leather booths). If you can, I also definitely recommend sitting in the large booth near the front window (after the pandemic ends of course).",

In lieu of the soup (full of soy) and salad (ginger dressing) I am always granted a $1 spicy mayo. Today, I called and a very anxious, Edward, denied my request and when I asked to speak with the manager he told me that there was none. When I explained I had been granted the request many times because it is a reasonable trade-off when considering the cost, he then spiraled into a monologue about me \"wanting to get him fired\" I explained that I \"did not want him to be fired, that I wanted to get clarification\" He claimed that he knew who I was (when really he was referencing another woman in my office) and that I was trying to \"trick him\" because I'd purchased it before. So, I decided to make that frigid 3 minute walk to ensure that the owners/managers were indeed not there and order my meal in person. Edward then became aggressive and yelled \"i just work here and follow rules\" Understandable Edward, but on every other occasion with reasonable humans engaged the exception has been made and never it acceptable to raise your voice on the phone and in person to a once loyal customer.",

I don\u2019t like trying new foods so I tend to go safe with meats, textures and flavors that are familiar to me. With that being said I had the curry chicken which was amazing! It\u2019s made with coconut milk, juicy slices of mango, potatoes, string beans, bell peppers onions. It\u2019s really the best thing I\u2019ve ever had. It IS a bit spicy, so I added a bit of extra coconut milk to tone it down for my husband and son. I do t know what dress they use on their sale but I love it. The spring roll is a little bready for my taste but again the dipping sauce is perfect. The brown rice that comes with the meal is complimentary. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was the miso soup. I couldn\u2019t get past the smell, and it really didn\u2019t taste good. So in the future I will opt out of the soup.",

I asked the guy server for the manager he asked what was it in reference to I told him service .. No one came then I asked him again then he made eye contact with her and then looked at me and said it was her .... What a coincidence ..... So she came over and told me how rude in fact I was, I said because I I wanted a drink ? And a salad ? In any event the food came and it was very bland . I wasted time money and gas.

(How so wealthy a neighborhood can have such consistently poor restaurants still baffles me.) Yamato's presentation masks otherwise average quality and significantly above average prices, something they can get away with given the generally poor quality of dining in Park Slope. Some of the rolls are excellent and consistently so. But the quality of the fish is definitely uneven, especially standards like yellowtail and tuna. In Manhattan, Yamato would definitely be considered below par for quality and pricing (but, again, good on presentation).",
