We ordered the nibble, shrimp gratin which was perfectly portioned and I couldn't better explain how delicious it was!  There were unfortunately two unwieldy Karen's who just could not be satisfied by all the attempts at problem solving by staff and management.

My wife and I have traveled several times to Paris and the countryside of France enjoying some of the best French classic dishes.  We sought out this restaurant as it was the last stop down an east-coast trip full of seafood and we were in the mood for some other-than-seafood dishes.  Based on other Google reviews, we actually didn't go with escargot or mussels as an appetizer, but instead chose the macaroni & cheese - which admittedly is absolutely delicious.  The cheese was spot on and cooked perfectly.  However, the dish in and of itself, really should be listed on the \"sides\" instead of the appetizers portion of the menu - we felt it was just not a suitable \"appetizer\" to get us going for the rest of the meal - again, delicious - just not appetizer class.  For mains - we had the BEEF BOURGUIGNON & the STEAK FRITES.  Two of the most classic/iconic bistro dishes I can think of.  The Beef Bourguignon came almost deconstructed and the pieces of beef were very large.  The flavor was decent, but the lack of broth made us feel a little wanting for the more classic version.  The Steak Frites - fries were just ok - I would bet $1 that they were absolutely not cooked in duck fat, but I could be wrong.  They just didn't taste like it and the steak had an unfamiliar reddish sauce on it that tasted more pre-prepared than not and it was just \"not classic\".  The meat was cooked very nicely, but the sauce and the fries just made it an ok experience.  Wine - delicious - we picked out a nice Burgundy and the service was very good.  The server was attentive.  All in all, if you're looking for a classic French Bistro/Brasserie meal, I would look elsewhere, if you're looking for a French meal with a new slant on the dishes, by all means, this is a great place.  The clientele was lively and the atmosphere very enjoyable in a terrific part of Georgetown.",

For dinner one time I got the fish with almond which was delicious!! And the second time I got the steak frites!! Also so good- although a little salty so if trying to watch your salt levels, maybe try a different dish!  The environment is so nice! I\u2019ve only eaten inside before which is so wonderfully decorated but they do have outdoor dining which looks nice as well. They are handling the pandemic very nicely and being very safe too which I like. The servers are always so friendly and enjoy being there and the manager comes to your table too and is very kind as well.  10/10. Could not recommend more!! And I work at a fancy hotel in the area and always send our guests here too!",

The next day, I left town for the weekend and didn't call the restaurant till yesterday to inquire about my items. To my surprise, the manager (Dean) told me that he has put them aside waiting to hear from me. That shows integrity... many times I have left items at restaurants and never seen them back. This shows everyone there has integrity and they care about their clients. That's why they kept my items for one week. We will go back again and again. Thank you to all of the staff.",

I went with a group of friends and we couldn't stop talking about how delicious the food was.My friends started with the escargots de Bourgogne and were in heaven. They loved that they were really blanced and not too salty. The french onion soup was also very delicious. Next was the chicken liver and foie gras parfait. To say my friend was literally licking the  foie gras off his knife says everything. Super smooth plus the crostinis were just perfectly toasted.  For our entrees we had the boeuf bourguignon, Steak Frites, and Steak Tartare and none of us were disappointed in anything. The beef fell apart of how tender it was when you put your fork in the boeuf bourguignon. All around great entree highly recommended by all 4 of us. The steak in the steak Frites was cooked to exactly what each of us wanted and the fries had an amazing taste. The steak tartare was really balanced with a perfect balance from the meat but a hint of acidity which was divine. Overall our whole experience here was absolutely \ud83d\udc4c we would do it again in a heart beat and last but not least our server, James, was very warm and very attentive even with a jam packed section due to the restaurant week buzz. Thank you to the staff and none of us would change one single thing!",

Brasserie Liberte seems to blend a light friendly atmosphere with an upmarket air that balances well between the formal and the casual. We came here for brunch, a small group with a child and service dog and enjoyed a fabulous experience. We were catered to perfectly on all matters including food allergies. The gluten free bread was by far the best I\u2019ve enjoyed in a restaurant, anywhere! Great job to the team here. We will be back.",

As a French person,I was not impressed with my meal. I had the onion soup who was good but nothing exceptional. The brochet de mer (fish) had nothing to rave about. Regarding the Paris Brest, I thought the pastry was too chewy. Service was Ok.
