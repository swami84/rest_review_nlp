I got The Viking and it was super tasty (salmon, avocado, spicy mayo) although portion size is a little small. They said they are waiting for the permit to come through so they can set up outdoor dining. Right now they just have some counters inside. I'm curious to try their teas and milk teas. Seems like a good place to meet for dessert (milkshakes, sweet milk teas, sweet waffles and crepes).",

I love how they use all the fresh ingredients such as salmon and fresh vegetables and you can see the process of making it, how cool is that. They have the 30% off promotion soft opening, won\u2019t be missing that. Will definitely be back to try more tea and their brunch menu.
