When I tasted them, they were mediocre and the food was oversalted. And the price is way too expensive for the food they are serving. The waitress had a little attitude and also was not properly taking care of our table. I was pouring myself and others in the table waters and I have to call her to take away the finished food because she barely comes back to check on our table. This is truly embarrassing experience especially I had company. I said to the waitress that I did not like this food because it is oversalted food and wasnt taste good. The waitress then called the manager and I said the same thing. The manager asked if I wanted a different dish but honestly after tasting the food I didnt think it was worth ordering or giving them another chance because my overall experience wasn't good and the other food tasted mediocre to me. When I checked my bill, the oversalted food was added to my bill so I have to speak to them about it. Not a pleasant experience. will not come back here.",

No they leave the sides on the table,  take 10 minutes to bring the steaks back, the same ones that were originally cooked, albiet dried out and not very good at that point.  Then our friends pay cash, and the server, never offered them change, keeping a huge tip. The potato puree was bland and lacked flavor of any kind. My steak was good, but not any better than any local steakhouse, and much more expensive. Strike 3.",

        "caption": "We located to western Massachusetts about 10 years ago from Michigan and in all those years, we have struggled to find a great, juicy cut of steak like we are used to back home. When our 15 year anniversary came up this year, we decided to book a room at MGM and give The Chandler Steakhouse a try. We were very hesitant about trying it because of all of the negative Google reviews, but we took a chance a made a reservation. Let me tell you, they did not disappoint! The service was incredible! On the table, they left us a handwritten note congratulating us on our anniversary and gave us free glasses of sparkling wine. Our server, Craig, was very knowledgable about the menu and attentive to our needs. For starters, we ordered the Lobster Bisque and Mixed Field Greens salad. The Bisque was AMAZING! It might be the best lobster bisque I've ever had. It was creamy, but not overwhelmingly and had actual, fresh chunks of seafood in it (some places puree everything in their bisques). For our meal, we both ordered the 7oz. Tenderloin of Beef, Herb Roasted Mushrooms, and Blistered Asparagus. The steak was also AMAZING! The cut of beef was so smooth and juicy and cooked to perfection. It went down like butter! They brought us a free extra side of au jus to dip it in, but it didn't even really need it. The mushrooms were very good and went nicely with the steak. Our only complaint, and it's minor, is the asparagus was slightly undercooked and we probably wouldn't order that again. The staff at the Chandler went out of their way to make our anniversary special and it was a GREAT dining experience. I can't compliment the steak enough and we are so excited to finally have a great steak place in the area. We can't wait to bring our out-of-town family here when they come for a visit!",

The wine list was great and offered something for everyone.  The meals lacked the finesse that their pricing should demand, my steak was cooked perfectly but the side of fries were undercooked and cold. My wife's scallops were well prepared but cold and her side of asparagus was covered by a layer of grated cheese that totally took away from the flavor.  Here is my problem, at $370 per couple before tip, this should have been an experience and it simply wasn't. The meal was good but could have been had for less than half of that price elsewhere in the other many good restaurants in the area. This was for 2 people with one cocktail each,  a bottle of wine and no dessert.  It was good, should have been great, shame that it wasn't. This area can use a destination restaurant but this isn't it.",

The manager came by to tell me the reason my steak sucked and was well done was that I didn't ask for a center cut. Unbeknownst to me there is a secret code you need to tell the cook if you want a mediocre steak for 58 dollars. The Place was awesome when it first opened and we were thrilled to have a nice place to go. Complete waste of $260 dollars, but never again, go to Northampton or West Hartford.",

Sal, our waiter, was the lone bright spot of the rest of the experience.  The bad: first off, they lie to you and tell you the steak is \"dry aged\". If by dry aged they mean they aged it for one day in the fridge, I guess I would believe that. For $54, I completely wasted my money. Ordered medium rare, like any good NY Strip should be. First steak came out was a gray .5\" high steak that looked like it came from the local grocery store. Well done - sent it back. Replacement came back looking like a true NY strip, and was underdone, basically rare. At this point I'm starving so I decide to just keep it. No seasoning to speak of, I had to empty the salt and pepper shaker onto the steak to give it any flavor. Chews like shoe leather.  The \"add-on\" special was described as scallops in a cheesey cream sauce. Perfect compliment for my steak, I think. Nope. Two dry scallops came clumsily sitting atop the steak. For $18 dollars I got a couple scallops. No thanks.  $300 for a 2 person dinner that mostly sucked. I'm getting annoyed just thinking about it, so I'll stop there.  Save your money and eat elsewhere.",

Buy a steak from Stop n Shop, put it in your fridge for two weeks, overcook it and taste, that's Chandlers.  Service was average, had to ask twice for a drink.  We sent one steak back and didn't replace it so for 1 steak that was bad, 2 drinks, a salad and mushrooms it was $115 wasted.",

That was the full extent of any semblance of service and food quality that you could expect to find outside of a Chili\u2019s. The drinks took forever to come and another 20 minutes went by before we had bread. We ordered the oysters which were the most affordable and best tasting food we had tonight-those took 30 minutes to arrive. They finally took our order and it took 90 minutes to come out of the kitchen. A VIP party in one of the private rooms had the attention of every manager and server in the whole place and anyone outside of that room was lucky to get a second glance. The scallops and prime rib were average at best. The ribeye was Sizzler quality and cold-not remotely worthy of the $58.00 ala carte price tag. The king crab leg at $38.00 as an addition to the steak was over cooked, cold and rubbery. It came with a cracker but it was so over cooked the cracker was useless as the shell would bend in any direction you tried to crack it. They were eventually sent back-something I think I\u2019ve done only one or two other times in my entire life. The music was too loud inside the restaurant and the ambiance was wanting at best. Most of the staff seemed surprisingly unfriendly and hurried. The entire experience was not worth $40.00 let alone $400.00. I will not be returning to this restaurant ever-even if there was a statewide famine and it was the only place with food. If you are looking for a great date night or a place to celebrate a special occasion I would completely steer clear of Chandler Steakhouse. It fell so short of the amazing things I\u2019ve come to expect from MGM properties in Las Vegas that I could hardly believe my eyes or my taste buds. I half expected the Bar Rescue guy to come storming through the door, kick us all out and have a heart to heart with management and staff but we just weren\u2019t that lucky. I gave this place 1 star because it wasn\u2019t possible to give zero.",

Steaks were okay, 2 were overdone to the point that they had a burnt crust on the outside, and 1 was okay, but definitely not worth $58 for a ribeye, I've had way better elsewhere for a lot less money.

My father is a chef in New York, I've trained under him and worked in a kitchen, though I have not been to culinary school. I would not call myself a chef because of never attending culinary school, but I do have a lot of culinary knowledge and am exceptional when it comes to making steaks, lamb chops, and other meals.  I came here to take my wife out for her birthday, and was very impressed with the atmosphere of this place. I knew the prices would be high so I expected a lot out of this place, considering there are amazing places in New York that are cheaper. We waited about 15 minutes for our server to come back and take our order, perhaps it felt so long because we already knew what we wanted to order, but the wait was a mild damper on the night.  We ordered the dry aged ribeye steak, lamb chops, both medium rare and the prime rib. It took about 40 minutes for the food to arrive and this was the most disappointing part of the night.  The rib eye's crust was hard and burnt, taking away a lot of the taste from the steak. I also couldn't taste a difference in aging until I got to the skin around the bone. There also seemed to be a lack of seasoning, and we had to ask for salt and pepper. Besides this the steak was okay in terms of juiciness but the burnt outside really hurt the taste.  The prime rib reminded me a lot of a cold cut roast beef. The horseradish sauce was delicious but the meat seemed to also lack seasoning.  The lamb chops were delicious, though the chefs did not render the fat. I personally believe the fat coupled with the meat is the best part of a lamb chop, but this fat was slightly gooey from not being rendered properly.  The manager was the one who took our food orders, I asked if there was anything special he could do as it was my wife's birthday. He said he would surprise us, but never came to our table again.  With these 3 plates and 2 drinks, I spent about $202 and left very upset as I could have gotten a $13 steak from stop and shop which would have tasted better. I am giving this place 2 stars for ambience, but I believe the chefs need a bit more training before these prices are even remotely justifiable.",

The decor reminded me of old world charm/ the rat pack era with its red velvet banquettes and beautiful chandelier above. The music fit the decor perfectly.  The food was 100%. Everyone loved everything they ordered.  Our server, Theresa treated  us like royalty. she was at our beck and call at all times. She explained how  Lobster Thermidor was prepared , as well as the mushrooms which everyone loved. She also suggested the steak tartare which most of us had not  ever had before and loved it ! and  she made recommendations for a delicious red wine. She also prepared our Caesar salad table-side.  There was a lot of food  being ordered for six people including appetizers entr\u00e9es , dessert and drinks and it all went so smoothly! We felt like the only people there yet the place was crowded . I think we were the last diners to leave that evening  and I can\u2019t wait to return!",

Im only giving it 4 stars because we waited 15 min after being seated before being asked if we wanted a drink or giving us menus. We made a reservation and was seated before our time so we believe that might be why.  We got steaks. Prime rib and sirloin. Potatoe pur\u00e9e and Caesar salads and some really yummy wine. Overall the staff was quite professional.  The bread was a mini pull apart loaf that was slathered in butter and also served with butter. It was soft and fresh and delicious.  The salad came on a cart where it was made fresh in front of us where we decided the contents. The dressing was mixed tableside into the salad which made the salad very fresh. The croutons were a bit large but tasty. They had fresh peppercorn ready to top off the salads.  The prime rib came tableside in the form of a roast where you picked your cut and we\u2019re served on the spot. It was served with creamy horseradish sauce in a mini serving boat and we were asked if we wanted fresh horseradish grated on top which we endulged. The prime rib was roughly 1.5 lbs and it wasn\u2019t a steak one could finish at one sitting. Even though I shared it there was enough to take home for another meal. The 8 oz sirloin was cooked to perfection and perfectly sized to finish at mealtime.  The manager came to the table. Wanted input on our meal and seemed very genuine about what our opinion was.  In the end the prices were spot on for a high end steakhouse. If you are expecting outback prices don\u2019t dine here. The steak at The Chandler is on a very different level and well worth the try.",
