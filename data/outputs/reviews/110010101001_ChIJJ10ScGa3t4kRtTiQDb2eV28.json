Even very tasty bread! For tiramisu dessert that if I have to be honest it did not drive me crazy (there were no ladyfingers or biscuits inside, rather fortified and a little expensive). Very nice staff and fast service!  (Original) Locale molto accogliente e buon cibo! Abbiamo passato la cena di capodanno in questo ristorante, ordinando  tortelloni alla zucca e bucatini cacio e pepe veramente gustosi! Anche il pane molto saporito! Per dolce del tiramis\u00f9 che se devo essere onesta non mi ha fatto impazzire (non vi erano savoiardi o biscotti all\u2019interno,piuttosto liquoroso e un pochetto expensive).

The pastas were indescribably delicious.  And the restaurant is very pretty and modern and sophisticated in its decor, and it was a nice treat for us to sit on the outside patio on a warm fall night. The servers were gracious and helpful and the wine choices were excellent. I WISH this restaurant was in NYC so I could go back and try everything on the menu. Even the charred cabbage side was yummy beyond belief. But most of all, each dish had so many thoughtful flavor combinations and exquisitely prepared elements within, the kind of things that would take an entire day  to prepare just the components of a salad alone, and which make for a level of nuance and flavor that my friends and I were as impressed as we could ever remember being by a chef. Bring this restaurant to New York!!!",

The menu at the restaurant is a bit different from what's posted on the website - check out DC Eater for the latest menu. The Italian food is truly authentic and the brainchild of a Fiola Mare alum.  The Italian happy hour \"Apertivo\" is decent with a pizza/wine deal and few dollars off the pizza along with some cured meats as well as a couple of cocktails for $8, which aren't offered on the Dinner menu. The refreshing \"Sorriento\" cocktail during Apertivo with vodka, limoncello, and sparkling wine packs a punch!  The complementary warm and fluffy house-baked semolina loaf is divine, definitely ask for it! We did and came in handy for the burrata!  The luscious glob of creamy Burrata with grilled country bread and marinated veggies in olive oil and pesto was tasty. I watched my friend's boyfriend relish in delight as he mopped up the last drop of oil sparing no crumbs with the complementary bread.  The Margherita pizza was heavenly with pillowy soft charred crust cooked all the way through to the bottom with tomato sauce,  fresh buffalo mozzarella topped with basil. It definitely hit the spot!  Similar to the sweet red bubbly wine Lambrusco, the \"Cantine Federiciane Gragnano\" had a hint of sweetness and paired well with the Margherita pizza.  Need to go to the bathroom? Push open the unmarked door in the wooden panel (sadly it's not a speakeasy - I was fooled too!).  Don't worry there's a new speakeasy in the lobby. Will be pushing open the blank white wall for some late night cocktails at \"Society\" next time!  Excited to come back and try the pasta and Tiramisu, as well as the craft cocktails at Society.",

Turns out in the dinning area, you are not allowed to order from the happy menu . 3.  Team arrived, no menus provided, had to get up and retrieve menus to everyone. 4. Try to order from happy hr menu, was informed I am not allowed and the menus were taken away from me. 5.  order some starters around 6:30pm from regular menu, team places their drinks. Some requested Diet Coke & Mountain Dew, received Pepsi. No explanation or information was received about no coke products available (which would have been 100% understandable) 5a. Some members try to say they didn\u2019t order that to waiter, waiter seemed confused, \u201cthis is soda, you want rum?\u201d- ah, no? 6. 7pm, starters came out (remember, I\u2019ve been here since 5:40pm) 7. We order our mains, at that time manager came up and ask how our experience has been? team stayed quiet & just smiled. We were trying to be polite. So I decided to say something. I think I mention 1 & 6 and gave me his card and ran off! 8. He sends his staff with Prosecco...? \u2014 no one likes that so we try to say no, thank you & received the weirdest confused look ever, sorry? 9. Server got changed to someone else and were left alone. 10. 7:40-ish main dishes came out, I\u2019ve been here since 5:40 (2hrs have passed now) 11. We ate ( food was good!) and ask for the check so we can just leave and forget this moment. 12. Service team started to plate us for desert...? Again we try to say no thank you, we just want to leave. Servers insisted and we got played. 13. One of my members from the team got up and spoke with the manager to explain that we appreciate the effort he Is trying to do, but we really don\u2019t need desert and if we could just pay so we can leave. 14. Acouple of minutes later, about 4 deserts came out, like seriously? We just said, thank you for trying but we just want to leave. Meanwhile, one of my members try to just pay (that was a struggle on its own)  We just literally got up after we confirm with the manager that we paid, and left. This has been one of the worst experiences in my life. It\u2019s a real shame since the location seems nice and the food is good. I could mention what I would have done if I was the manager, but will not. To each their own.",

Our having stumbled into such a great meal did the chef and waiter a disservice, as their efforts were worth a planned visit.

I highly recommend the charcuterie, quail, eggplant, hamacha, black bass and gnocchi! The dishes were flavorful and beautifully plated. Service was also amazing. Will definitely be coming back with guests!",
