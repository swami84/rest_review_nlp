Few customers, food quality degraded and you don't get what you pay for. Also the place started looking outdated and needs renovation. Today is the second time I noticed almost the same remarks. Food looks like left overs. The floor, the few old chairs they have and the small counter where you supposed to eat are dirty. I had to clean where to sit and eat. Even worse, my tray wasn't cleaned after the previous customer and my grilled chicken kebab was oily \ud83e\udd14. See attached photos Will never eat here",
