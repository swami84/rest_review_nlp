Run by authentic and wonderfully friend Irish expats, who are more than happy to welcome you into their cosy establishment and ply you with nice drink and some really good food!  Despite visiting on a weekend (during which they close earlier in the evenings I think) I can see this location being very popular with the local Wall Street crowds, and with the quality of what\u2019s served, you\u2019ll understand why!  Plenty of drink and food options to satisfy any palette or appetite, and it\u2019s not the average pub food one might expect. If you\u2019re in the area, I\u2019d recommend wholeheartedly.",

Before I put my things down the waitress approached me and asked me what I wanted to drink, I told her what I wanted and she proceeded to place a menu on my table and walk away. Instead of returning back to my table with the drink I requested she just asked me what I wanted from the menu. I asked for Fish & Chips and didn't receive it until 47 minutes later and the drink, OH I didn't get that until I actually had to remind the waitress for it. She was so busy playing on her cell phone instead of paying attention to her customers IN FRONT OF HER! When I was done eating the food and finally wanted to wash my food down with a cold beverage, I requested the drink followed by the 'check'. It was such a weird situation already being that she forgot my drink and my food arrived after such a long time that I felt obligated to tip her being that she wouldn't stop apologizing as if she didn't mean to be on her phone the entire hour I was there. The fact that she was more worried about 'playing on her cell phone' than attending to her customers was a shame. I definitely won't be eating from this place after that service especially since I was on my hour lunch and didn't get my meal until after 47 minutes or the drink until after the meal.",

I brought this up to the owner, cordially and nicely, and she essentially yelled at our table, was combative and asked us aggressively \"what can we do.\" I suggested a free drink, to which she denied. I do not suggest this place. They do not care about things being clean, good service or a general politeness and care to their customers. Period. There are better places in Fidi, so avoid this one.

Stopped hoping for a great pint of Guinness and a very good dessert, specifically, bread pudding.  This is your normal run-of-the-mill  Irish pub.  If you want to settle, please stop and partake.  The first sin was the Guinness was on the flat side!  Second, they only had a second-hand mass produced apple pie..  .   The Shot of Jamison was good on the positive. I noted the patron next to me hogging down on a bunch of fried food, if you are in to mediocre tavern food, this plac e is for you.  Additionally, the ambience is nothng special, a average bar and little wood and no booths that I saw.The bathroom had no paper towels, just a hand dryer to blow people's germs around. Yes, as another astute reviewer noted the service was good.  Please note that I was one of approximately 6  people sitting at the bar.  Enjoy!",
