I asked for the gulf shrimp as well as the herb chicken which is always delicious every time. Especially more so now since it\u2019s what I crave for during my pregnancy. Today was disappointing because I checked my food only to see the portion size was way less then what I normally see and get.  So I asked the girl at the counter did the portion size change. She then laughed and said I got a wrap size portion. I replied and said well I asked for a bowl so she goes to the back and tells the guy to add more lettuce. If I would have paid in cash I would of definitely asked for my money back it was completely rude and very unprofessional.",

When the cashier totaled out the price, I noticed he charged us for double the amount of chicken. I brought it to his attention, and he removed the double chicken on each bowl, leaving only one order of chicken on each bowl, which was correct. My order also said extra cheese as it was supposed to. We live almost an hour away, so when we got home and went to eat (trusting that the  orders were correct) they were most definitely not correct. His didn't have chicken AT ALL, and mine had no cheese. You'd think after I corrected the cashier twice, the order would be correct. Aside from the awful communication skills of the staff, the food was good.",

I brought it to his attention, and he removed the double chicken on each bowl, leaving only one order of chicken on each bowl, which was correct. My order also said extra cheese as it was supposed to. We live almost an hour away, so when we got home and went to eat (trusting that the  orders were correct) they were most definitely not correct. His didn't have chicken AT ALL, and mine had no cheese. You'd think after I corrected the cashier twice, the order would be correct.

I thought it came from the downtown location but I had accidentally ordered from the Soho location.  When it arrived, it was hardly edible.  The grilled chicken I had requested was fatty and brown as if the teriyaki chicken had been used.  The lettuce and cucumbers were soaking wet and left a puddle of water at the bottom of the salad.  UberEats wouldn't refund my money.  Thinking it had been from downtown, I called and we figured out it hadn't been from there.  Nonetheless, they offered to make the salad again for me free of charge, even though the salad had not come from this location.  That's customer service! Thank you, SoFresh!",

The 3 star review is due to my last two experiences with take out. One order I placed was supposed to be a bowl and it was made as a wrap. When I brought this to the attention of the staff I was told they would remake it as a bowl but I would have to wait up to 15 minutes. I ordered take out because I did not have the time to dine-in, so something like a free drink or even just a sincere apology would have been more convenient. The more recent time I ordered a bowl that was supposed to include feta and jalapenos. It had neither. This was frustrating because I spent nearly $14 and paid extra for the feta I didn't receive. In addition, I have noticed that the take out portions are significantly smaller. I will continue to dine here, but not take out.",
