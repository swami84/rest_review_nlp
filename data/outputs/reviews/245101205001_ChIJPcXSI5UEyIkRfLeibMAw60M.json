For some reason when asking for an iced mocha the workers here think that any flavor they want is an adequate substitute (pumpkin spice, coffee, caramel) in lieu of the mocha flavor. The larger problem is they don't actually check your order at the register it just charge you before you get a chance to find out that your order is wrong once again. Not awful location for basic cup of joe but they struggle with details and can be slow on some days.",
