As for the tasting, it is certainly not worth $89. First, giving a single cracker as one of the appetizers is a little ridiculous. I get this is a tasting restaurant, but providing extremely small portions like that really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Second, I wish they included more options to not have so much raw fish in the the tasting. I understand it is an essential part of Japanese cuisine, but my friend and I were not able to enjoy those parts as we are not fans of the texture of raw fish.  Third, I think it would be best to have the tasting as an option and include other dishes. The flavors in the dishes were phenomenal and would enjoy it more in actual entrees. In conclusion, the drinks and desserts were the only parts of this experience that were worth it. I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking to leave with a full stomach. Only go if you want to enjoy a high end culinary experience.",

It was my first time dinning out during COVID, I really appreciated how they follow COVID Protocols temperature check before entering, masks (except while dinning) social distancing tables. Perfect date night for me and my boyfriend.  We started off with drinks he had Japanese Whisky Yamasaki while I ordered why is it floor 3.1, both were so smooth and tasty. Our waiter was Angel he was so sweet he took extra care of us, we were really just taking our time and enjoying ourselves.  Michael the Manager also made sure we were having the exceptional Nara -Ya experience, which I definitely appreciate.  We ordered the Tasting Menu they gave us Three options for the Appetizers and for the Second course,  six course dinner I believe.   We also order the Smoke Zuke Tuna which was so worth it.  The presentation made for a beautiful Video, mouthwatering taste of the Tuna delicious.  Every course was amazing I was surprised one of the dishes was a pan seared squab it was so flavorful and tender which I highly recommend.  Tasty and beautiful presentation for our Omakase Sushi Courses! Since it was a special occasion they gave us an extra special desert Vegan Chocolate Ganache which was so savory.  Amazing Venue for date night or a special occasion.  An Instagramming experience!",

        "caption": "We had the pleasure of enjoying the tasting menu on the second day that Nara-ya was open. When we came in we had to check in at the front before being let up on the elevators. Standard covid protocols-temp check etc. We got up to floor 3.1 and we\u2019re guided to our seats. It was a lovely water front view. Angel was our server and he was attentive! To drink I started with the wagyu and whiskey, which was delicious, and my date had the Japanese old fashion. We ended up also having the ballad of yasuke( also very good) and the martini umami. We selected the standard tasting menu, with 5 courses but upgraded the third dish. I upgraded the started dish to add caviar and my date upgraded it to the tuna. I highly recommend upgrading to the tuna. It was so good! For the main I got the braised short rib\u2014so tender and flavorful and my partner got the bird(whose name I forget). Of course there was sushi which was also so good. And finally desert, a matcha tiramisu, which was so so good.We capped it off with some champagne because we were celebrating an anniversary.  Over all- decor was cute,views were amazing. Bathroom impeccable. Covid protocols followed Staff- friendly and very attentive.Angel was the best. If you go, as for him. He had several tables he was taking care of, but didn\u2019t miss a beat. The managers also came by to chat which was nice. Over all attentive Food- quite the fusion of flavors. I wouldn\u2019t have thought of some of these flavors and combos. It as also nice that it wasn\u2019t just a sushi place. The tasting menus amount was just right.you didn\u2019t leave so full you couldn\u2019t walk or hungry after.( we went at 6 pm and had a light lunch at about 1pm and left feeling satisfied) Price- the price point wasn\u2019t bad for a 5 course tasting menu. I will say there was a 20% service charge, I\u2019m guessing a covid charge which doesn\u2019t go to the wait staff so we had to add another 20 % on top. Which was fine, Angel more than deserved it. On a side note, we saw two local dc celebs eating there too, so maybe this will be a socialite haven, who knows!  Over all great experience. Worth the money!",
