The meat \"Chicken\" didn't look like chicken or taste like chicken after a few bits I notice the strange look and texture of the meat. It definitely wasn't chicken!!! I don't know what type of rodent they are serving as chicken but what they call chicken is definitely not chicken. I was disgusted and lost my appetite my stomach immediately began to pain me. I examined the meat a little more then immediately called the Resturant back to complain and demand my money back !!! they rushed over to refund me back my money and they took their food back. I'm definitely going to call the health department on them it's wrong for them to serve people strange looking meat that doesn't look or even taste like chicken. I will never eat from them again. FYI never Order any Chicken from them\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f",

If you go I recommend the sweet potato roll and the mango avocado roll. They were my favorite of all the rolls I have tried. My least favorite item on the menu was the gyoza. They have options for the gyoza but I wouldn't recommend any of them. The service was good. I'm not sure how long they have been at this location. It isn't a very  busy place in the afternoon. Service is fast here especially if you order for pick up. Delivery does take a long time. Overall great place for lunch if you are in the area\ud83d\udc4d",

Couple minutes later she brought our food and that was it, we didn't see her again. I had to ask the cashier to bring an additional Jasmine rice since our waitress never came back to the table. Upon leaving the cashier asked if I would be leaving a tip. I ignored him and continued to put on my jacket to leave. He asked AGAIN when I was approaching the door. I told him not only was it unprofessional of him to even ask but our waitress NEVER returned to the table to ask if we needed anything further and she didn't earn a tip. He proceeded to shake his head about speak in his foreign language as if I was in the wrong. The food was mediocre and the service was the same. I won't be returning.",

I only ordered the seafood combo fried rice which was listed as a spicy dish. The portion was large enough for at least two people and was delicious. Although, it was listed as spicy it was very mild but had a flavorful taste to it. It also had plenty of seafood in the rice and would make a great choice for any seafood lover. The service was decent and fast. I would definitely try this restaurant again in the future.",
