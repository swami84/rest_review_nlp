Be nice to the people who handle your food. The picture is after I tore the other 6 inch; second lunch in 3 hours. Delish! Thank you!",

I always order ahead online if I can and I've never had an issue with my platters or sandwiches being late. They're also happy to pack stuff on the side like mustard, mayo, jalepenos, etc. that not everyone might want on a sandwich. Space is small but there are tables outside. Also, a Starbucks next door.",
