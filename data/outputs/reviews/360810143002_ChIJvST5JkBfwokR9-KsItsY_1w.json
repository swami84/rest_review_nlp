So I don\u2019t know if they did that or if their something with the app they should fix it ASAP or if it\u2019s them aka the person  that is delivering the food make sure you don\u2019t mark deliver when it\u2019s not cause then it says to enjoy our food and especially in my case I live in the projects so you know people would try steal food. It makes me always worry and call the dominos place to find out where my food. Also the worst thing I hate is that when I call the place 2 or 3 times to get a hold of someone to find out about my food cause this happen more then once the people in the store don\u2019t answer or want to answer. So it\u2019s very frustrating. So hopefully this place fix their app and make sure they don\u2019t mark that their food deliver when it\u2019s not cause that is false information about where their food is at.",

WORST and most DISRESPECTFUL experience ever.  Today, we placed a delivery at 6:30 PM and receive our order at 8 PM -- we did not complain, but the driver told us to \"never order from dominos again\" for asking him to delivery it to my apartment door. I thought dominos provide CONTACTLESS delivery and leaving the pizza in front of the building isn't contactless delivery. He stated that there is a building policy (my building) that does not allow him to come in and as a resident, there are no signs whatsoever stating that policy. It says clearly to ring the virtual\u00a0dootman to access the building and I let him in like I usually do. I do not understand why this is an issue and why this couldn't have been brought up before the store decided to proceed on with my order. The delivery took 1.5 hr when the store is\u00a0 less than 10 minutes away from my address and my food was cold despite the summer heat. After the baffling experience, I contacted the store to ask the customer representative for the delivery guy's name so I can properly file a complain. Instead of apologizing or even trying to listen to my story, she said \"do whatever you want\" and hung up on me twice. I find it odd that you guys advertise \"contactless delivery\", placing safety first when you guys can't deliver what you guys promised. I would like a full refund for this order and I am very sad to see your service declining. I am sure there are other ways to handle this for example, asking people to pick up when they can't promise delivery in a respected time. I pay a delivery fee, and tip the guy to receive this kind of treatment is just unheard of. The disrespect I felt from someone that I paid to get my food is absurd. I work 12-13 hrs without a break and him asking me to take 10 mins away from my meeting time to \"come down\" is just ridiculous. We pay an extra free for a reason and we tip him for a reason. I would like to escalate this because the type of service you are providing is extremely unheard of -- who tells their customer to never order again without even a proper greeting. He left my food in front of my door and shouted \"do not order from us again\" across my hallway. Please direct me to the proper people to discuss this issue further.",

He didn't even get out of the car. The store itself never remade the pizza's so that it could be fresh they delivered me cold pizza. This is by far the worst customer service I have EVER experienced.

He then made a very inappropriate and irrelevant reference to my basement apartment being illegal after pointing out that he failed to follow the instructions that are clearly and correctly typed \"please ring doorbell\". Little did he know that a basement apartment can be made legal when filing the proper permits and renovating it to follow standard building codes after inspection. Even after I was more than kind to tip him, he did not thank me. I will more than likely not order from Dominoes anymore since my experiences have always been a \"hit or miss\" situation when ordering from Dominoes on Steinway. It appears that Dominoes has poor training (if any at all) standards when hiring delivery drivers. Their pizza is good most of the time however, I recommend picking up if you are ever nearby since most of their their delivery fleet's punctuality and courteous behavior are dismal at best.",

At the end of the night I only was hungry and sad to throw my money like that... and all my family.  They don\u2019t offer any solution, they only have the money, tips in cash and they don\u2019t care about the customer at all. It is not my first time that they act like that... they don\u2019t answer and throw the phone while you are trying to talk, the have always a bad attitude. I miss Pizza Hut near my neighborhood they were always good with my orders... and the pizza always was hot, your pizza also is cold!",

The cheese bread was raw inside and there was some gross goo on top of it which I have never seen before. And the pizza looked like it was recooked / rebaked and then they just threw cold / raw toppings on top of it. Was very disappointed with this meal and won't be going back to this Dominos location ever. Don't waste your time, they obviously don't care how your food will look and taste like.",

I placed an order a little bit before 7 and was expecting it to get to me by maybe like 8. I never got my order until about TEN. It was a simple order of two pizzas and some chicken wings. I don't understand how it almost took three hours just for that. I called the store two times to call about where my order was and they kept telling me they are waiting on the driver to come. The second time i called the employe just simply hung up on me.When the pizza finally came the driver tried to charge me five dollars extra for his tip. 3 hours late and he still expected a tip that high for a order that didn't cost more than 20. Hope they can really employe more staff so that this never happens again.Will never be ordering from this place again.",

I clocked back in from my lunch break taking no lunch and waited another hour passes by and I am soon to leave work and still nothing. The manager tells me I am sorry the driver is 8 minutes away I will have him give you a complimentary coke. I said okay. I called again asking where was my food (30 minutes after I hung up with him) the night shift manager thought I was complaining from weeks ago. I ask him to refund my money I am waiting after my shift had been over at least 20 minutes. He said I will cancel the order give me no explanation no apologies and clicks the phone on me. This is really messed up. After 10 minutes the delivery guy calls me shows up and gives me the pizza I should have received at least 30 minutes ago and walks away. I look at the box its bent half way; of course when I open the box inside is a cold pizza. Half of it is broken; looks like they just threw the pieces inside. Horrible experience. If you want to eat it warm you might as well go pick it up. The delivery sucks. I ordered at 8:30pm and I did not get my order until 11:25pm. I am not even hungry anymore.",
