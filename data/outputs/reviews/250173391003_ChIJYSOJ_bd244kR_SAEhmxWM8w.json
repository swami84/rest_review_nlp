Me and friend was trying to order our food, but no one could see us, we have to work out and find a waiter. A man came and was very unfriendly to us. He even scolded us that we should wait. He was very tough and impatient. When I called to make the reservation, I felt that they were bad, as if they could not understand customer's requests, I had to repeat my words for more than three times before I could book my table. As soon as we started to eat, both of us did not order much food. A waiter came over and said, \"Make sure you can finish your food.\" I was puzzled. To be honest the food was not even that great and look at the picture this is what their dishes like. They haven't been cleaned yet. I feel very worried about the hygiene. Anyway, I don't recommend you to have dinner in this place. What a terrible dining experience!",

When I finally got a chance to ask him how late is late in his opinion, he said 10 minutes but I was actually right on the 10 minutes. That means he gave our seats away before 10 minutes. I was a little upset and started arguing with him. It was pouring and we tried our best to be there just to be told that we lost our reservation. Guess what he said? He told me to SHUT UP! I read other people's reviews on yelp and they all had similar experience. This will be my last time to come to this restaurant and folks, if you are not going to be RIGHT ON TIME with your reservation, be prepared to get your a** kicked out.",

With only limited eating time, customers also are not easy to order food from this restaurant. Not like most of the other Korean BBQ restaurants, Sura is the worst.

Little did i know that when you order all you can eat they charge you extra $ for what you didnt eat. I didnt eat almost any of it on the first and only round of food. I LOVE scallion pancakes and lve never had bad ones until last night. Super greasy and undercooked. They charge for adult portions if youre over 8 and we had two girls who were 9 and didnt end up eating any of the food other than a few bites of white rice. Our bill was 700$ . The server was terrible and the food wasnt even good. You could go anywhere and spend this kind of money.",

I feel bad about those who reviewed them for poor service because that has never been the case the ~5 times I've visited, different days and times and wait staff. I don't have a red carpet rolled out for me at every restaurant, nor do I expect it. I think what people are picking up on, and are trying to say is that they do not have a host. Everyone plays a part and helps take orders, serve, make and give drinks, and importantly for Korean BBQ- replacing the hot plates when someone accidentally burns something, or simply over time as sauces build up & cook. The only complaint I've ever had was that at night, the music gets very loud....this is coming from a 1/2 deaf girl! I'm not sure if they're covering up a karaoke place next door or trying to accommodate the bustling group conversations that happen over this type of dining, but it's nonexistent during the day and doesn't impact HOW DELICIOUS the food is. I really hope they address this since I'm not the only or first one to review that detail...and it honestly does deter me from going when I want a more relaxing night out. For all-you-can eat, it is a GREAT PRICE, GOOD VALUE. I always get the top (more money, but not by much so worth it based on your preference) option. Most outrageously priced item is the soju. They sell it for literally 3\u00d7 the price I buy it at Total Wine or 2\u00d7 more at my favorite hot pot place... not going to deter me from returning though.\ud83d\ude42 Parking is in the back in a shared big lot which was the only \"tough\" part of locating it by car..",

During this visit with my wife, I pointed out to our waitress that there was a bug still crawling around in our salad. So she takes the salad aside and as she is walking away, turns back and asked if we wanted another one. We said no and there were no further exchange of words with her. My wife was ready to bolt out of there but I asked her to stay. So we didn't leave and decided to give them a chance with the rest of the food as we were already committed. After some time, our waitress comes back with our order but we were missing a couple of items. We started eating and waited for the rest of the order but she never came back around after that. Nearly all of the wait staff were standing in their own little group near the cash register chatting amongst themselves and never  came to check in on us except for when one of them came by to change the heating plate. The attention to customers service has deteriorated since I first went there. We may give them another chance but highly doubt that we'll be going to Sura anytime soon if at all.",

The behavior of the staff and service was just plain weird.  They acted like they expected us to steal food or something.  It was like they were penny pinching. They told us that we must eat all of our food before we could order something else.  At first I thought it was just a language barrier, but the nervousness of the wait staff made for a very unpleasant atmosphere.  If that was not enough, the meat was very bland. The bean sauce wasn't that flavorful to help the unseasoned meat.  The garlic sauce was okay, but they could really use more variety of more flavorful sauces.  Perhaps the food is more traditional Korean than I am used to.  There were a lot of Asians, probably Koreans, dining there. I have just had better, more flavorful bbq.  I seriously wanted to ask for some salt!  I ordered chicken for the kids and the beef tongue for me, which I normally really enjoy.  The tongue was served frozen, which was also a surprise, and was very bland once cooked.  I was underwhelmed to say the least.  I thought it was very, very expensive since the food was so underwhelming.  The whole experience just wasn't worth the $$ for me.",

Once we got the routine of how to order it was a pleasant experience and actually quite fun. The price is around $28 per  person (adults) and $8.95 for kids 4-8 years old. Our total was roughly $396 for a group of 10. Great experience will definitely be coming again.",

Most recent visit, party of five went in around 3pm, allot of empty tables. The waiter checked in only once to seat us and get our initial order, then pretty much forgot about us. Once we were seated,  we had to flag down our waiter to order more food, as we ordered off buffet menu for five.  Could only get there attention once within the approximate one hour and fifteen minutes we were there, even then the waiter forgot other things we asked for. We got fed up and asked for our check. I then expressed to them how disappointed we were with the service. The owner/women was apologetic and at that point offered to bring more food over, we declined. I guess as an apology, with our check she brought over free ice cream dessert, but we were still disappointed,  as we still paid buffet for 5; all you can eat, but in the end really wound up only being able to order one small meat plate each costing about $25 each person. Left feeling hungry, ripped off and disappointed. I don't plan on coming back.",

On the bill, they charged 25.95 each person, however I did not want to say anything about it. The grill stove is weak, so you will wait a long time for your meat to be cooked. A good thing is that if you pay in cash, you will save 5% on the bill. So with cash, each person is 25.95. With card, it\u2019s more. Also, You will not have the same server when coming here. You will have multiple workers to come assist your table, so that is a little confusing. Service was okay, as I asked for a few things that were forgetten, which caused me to ask again.",

I've had many Korean bbq elsewhere and this does not compare.  Quite disappointing.  Service - We were sat next to where they disposed all the dishes and was splashed with some nasty sauce when a careless waiter tossed something in there.  No apologies made.  They came over and handed us some wet naps. Not a simple sorry from the waiter or manager.  Drinks took about 20 minutes and we still had no kimchi even when asked 4 times.  I would have rated this a 3 star for the food but is taking one star off with the pretty bad service they had. One would imagine a manager of some sort would have came out to apologize for the splash, but that courtesy was not there.  I wouldn't recommend this place.",

Also in this cold windy night the dinning room gets chilly when the doors open.  Definitely go the food was delicious and the cooking allows you to slow down and enjoy it.",

Here we are the 2 of us with a hundred and a $140 dollar tab, but we were made to feel  like we were a bother to the servers. Busboy was more talkative, and welcoming then then our own waitor. I dropped my chop sticks on the floor and asked for another set and they refused asking me to find the chopstick that was  somewhere under the table, which was fine, it was just they expected me to stop eating my hot meal to dig under their table and bench seating in their dim lighted restaurant before handing me a new set to eat my hot meal! It was very offensive and felt almost as if they were assuming that I had pocketed them.. my friend and I laugh about it now but at the time it was very ignorant and offensive on their behalf to make me dig on a dirty floor in the middle of my meal before providing me with another eating utensil. Can you say STINGY!  I mean come on? How much does does a set  of chop sticks cost a restaurant anyway??? And if it was that important to them couldn't they have asked one of their bus boys to get on their hands and knees and look for them. Or better yet since the server was the one giving me a hard time. Why couldn't he just get down there and find them his self. I mean come on. For that money you better be handing me as many utensils, napkins, etc that I ask for! Again like I said it's funny now and I will not be back their again Hopefully they've been able to up their chopstick quantity and no one else has to experience that madness",

But, reassured me the charge had been voided. I was so upset that a manager would make that kind of a mistake. I asked to speak to him once more. The manager repeated what the waitress already had told me. I was to wait two or more days for my money to be refunded to my account. How dare him assume that I didn't have a need for my money. Still what bothered me the most is the manager didn't even offer me a coupon or anything. He made sure I signed for my payment $28. Stated the money would be refunded soon and went back to work.",

No servers checked on our table the entire 1 hour+ meal period.  We always had to flag them down.  I asked one of the servers, Alex, for a refill on kimchee\u2026 he said OK\u2026 7-8 minutes go by\u2026 Alex is walking around the restaurant but no refill\u2026 then I ask him again.. he says \u201cOh, yeah, I will get it for you.\u201d\u2026. another 5-6 minutes go by nothing\u2026  So I ask him again\u2026 he says \u201cwe are under-staffed\u2026 and the kimchee has to be made.\u201d   WHAAAAAA???  Kimchee has to be MADE???  Are you serious dude?  The fermented kimchee was made weeks ago!  Are you kidding me Alex???  Then I ask another young lady server for the kimchee\u2026 30 seconds later she gave us a heaping portion of kimchee\u2026 30 seconds is all it took her to get it\u2026  So now, I learned by then asking for extra napkins might be another congressional battle so, I went up to the bar to get some napkins myself\u2026  but then I saw the restaurant manager\u2026 this is where it took a lunch experience from being disappointing to downright horrifying.   I tried to give the manager a constructive feedback by letting him know the sub-par service we have received\u2026 no checking on our table\u2026 Alex not knowing what kimchee is, etc.  he literally rips my head off and tells me\u2026 \u201cWE ARE UNDERSTAFFED SO WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING MORE!!!  WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME RIGHT NOW???\u201d   Ouch\u2026  Sorry that I tried to give some constructive feedback\u2026   Then the nice young lady server from earlier came over and tried to diffuse the situation.  The manager just walks away and let's the server handle the situation!!!   But she was an absolute sweet heart\u2026  so as I returned to my table, the manager was near my table already and tells my wife \u201cYour husband is crazy!\u201d   Then he goes on a Crazy Rant in front of all customers yelling at me how everybody is too busy!!!  OMG!!!   I have a video capturing the rant but I cannot post it so I am posting some of the pictures of the manager yelling in the dining room floor in the way he behaved towards me\u2026 (if you want to see the video, reply to this post) It was absolutely a horrifying experience\u2026  Let\u2019s start at 4 stars for the food taste\u2026 then a +1 star for the nice young server lady\u2026 but a -1 star for the clueless Alex\u2026 then -5 stars for the manager\u2026 that means I should give a -1 star but I can\u2019t so I am simply giving this place a 1 star\u2026 You make the judgement as to if you should be treated this way paying $30 per person!!   I would spend my hard earned money somewhere else where they understand customer service.",

They have 2 menus to chose from, either A, cheaper one with less options, or B, a slightly more expensive one that includes the first menu's options and more. My friends and I went for option A, and we loved the spicy pork, prime brisket, and pork belly. I felt like option A had plenty of options for us, with different meats, soup, scallion pancake, etc. They also give you many side dishes as usual and you can ask for rice. The downsides were that there were no exhaust pipes or fans or anything so the restaurant felt/smelled very smoky as food cooked, and it was difficult to call the waiter over and get service (as with many AYCE restaurants).",
