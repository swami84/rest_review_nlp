I orded 2 pan pizzas with Pepperoni and sausage.. picked up my order in 30 min ... While in the restaurant MY SPIRIT told me to open the box. What do you know.... 2 cheese pizzas. The cashier man looked at me in my eyes and told me that's what I ordered. If I wanted plain pizza I would have ordered it sir. That's not what I ordered. Then he admitted the truth to the manager. \"Yeah... She wanted that but I gave her cheese\".... Just go somewhere else.. anything is better than this... If worse comes to worse order Little Caesars. That sure says a lot .!!!",

Right after that someone just picked! So I start the order and include the delivery! I order 2 medium pizza with pineapple and chicken on the pizza, 14 plain chicken wings, and 2 orders of lava cakes.  While my order was processed pizza receive my order an hour later. I look at my order of pizza, it turns out it was pepperoni which I didn\u2019t order, they only gave the correct order which is chicken pizza and they gave me 1 order of lava cake as well! II then called and filed a complaint to the manager about this! The manager responded \u201c don\u2019t touch the pepperoni pizza they will exchange the pineapple when the next delivery arrives! Exchanging pizza what kind of mess is this! And I also told him I order 2 orders of lava cakes and the manager told me that I mentioned I order two which it comes two in there! I know that if I said I want 2 lava cakes then that means two orders of lava cakes, he trying to charge and said if I wanted another order of lava cake he will charge! Are you serious? So I said canceled it! I\u2019ll just wait until I will contact the head of dominos pizza about this swapping pizza and charging another order lava cakes which I order two before smh  Don't recommend this place the manager and the workers should be fired! The pizza part what they going to do with the exchange pepperoni pizza, give it to another customer! The delivery driver can\u2019t believe it! He was surprised to see this! He even said what is this smh and I told him well the manager said to exchange pizza! Never heard like this before",

Some time later an automated voice call and said the driver just left the store with your order and to look out for him I waited over 45 mins and at this point I didn\u2019t even want it anymore this store is 3blocks from my house only reason I didn\u2019t go is because it was very late like 11 pm when I placed the order there is absolutely no reason a driver should be on the road with my food for 45 mins",

Then the young lady checked my order and literally picked up my pizza that had been ready atleast 15 minutes.  It was just sitting there.  I can understand that they were busy because there was only 2 workers on the floor, but don\u2019t make your customers think you don\u2019t give a damn.   Although you probably don\u2019t care, but keep it to yourself.  Don\u2019t let your actions show it.  For this reason I will not be doing business with this company. If I don\u2019t order pizza before Pizza Hut closes.  Then we just won\u2019t be eating any, because Dominos customer service is horrible.

I am 5 to 8 min drive from the store location. The means to actually pick it up my order was not available thus delivery.  At 930 i called and i was told the pizza never left the store. At 10 i called and i was put on hold to wait for a manager. The manager picked up then hung up. I called back they let the phone ring. I call again they put me on hold. I called a total of 9 times and not once did anyone offer a reason for why it's late or its location. I eventually go to the store around 1044pm thats around the time i actually get there. On the way the driver finally calls saying do you still want your pizza. I respond with i want a refund and he hangs up immediately. I get to the store asking to speak to the manager so they can call corporate so i can request my money to be returned in 24 hours and not 4 to 6 business days. It took them 2 hours to make and never deliver my order so in less than that time they can give me my money back. The manager proceeds to say we dont have a corporate. After arguing he then says i cant call corporate. We argue some more and he ends with im not wasting my time to call coporate. I finally ask for the number myself which he refuses to give. He states its on the website like its always been. After some more arguing he gives me the number. There was only 2 paying customers in the store the whole time. So they were not busy. To back track a lil, one of the times i called i asked to speak with a manager and they put me on hold for 10 min or maybe more. When I get there the manager is standing right next to the person who answers the phone and nobody was on the phone when i arrived although i had been on hold 2 min prior to my arrival for about 5 min or so (this is the 9th call).  Everytime i order from this location there is a problem. Apparently the drivers are not allowed to get out thier cars when delivering pizza. They dont call to let you know they are downstairs. And have major attitudes when dealing with customers angry or not. Not once did i curse or insult anyone. And yet they still couldnt handle that.  They did not inform me i could have gotten my food for free. They did not offer a free pizza as mediation as they have a policy for. And they still offered no explanation as for the nearly 2 hour delay. I was unaware of the policies mentioned above.  I finally do call coporate but got no answer in response. I would appreciate my refund by the close of business today.  Since you as a company, store, chain can charge a person before the pizza is even ready or delivered.  The manager, also, did not provide his name.",

Someone stole my credit card information and, among other things, used it to buy a pizza at this location. There was no problem using my information from my card (in TEXAS) to purchase a pizza in BROOKLYN. Zero verification, zero care, so long as the card works, and ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE when I called the location to request a refund. Corporate isn't much better, and hasn't moved on this issue in nearly a week. It's not that I need the 31.00 all that bad, it's the fact that they are refusing fault and not doing a thing to make this right. If I was in Brooklyn, the only reason I would come to this Domino's is to rip the manager a new one.",
