I asked my girlfriends who were with me to taste it as well just to make sure. They confirmed it. When I reached back out to the server to let him know, his response was unaccommodating. Most servers with any customer service knowledge would respond with \"I am sorry about that, would you like another flavor/option?\" That just seems the most appropriate response. However this server responded with, \"I don't understand, that's not possible. I just made it with the same ingredients.\" I went back trying to explain to him that even if that is true, I am drinking it now and it has no flavor. After which he still responded standing his ground and walking away. After reprocessing my thoughts I reached back out a third time and just asked for another smoothie flavor. He remade it for me at no additional cost which is why there are 2 stars. The overall experience, however, has ruined this establishment for me indefinitely.",
