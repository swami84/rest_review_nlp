But my real problem with these guys is their lazy, inattentive service. On the past 3 occasions I have had the following issues:  1) Ordered for pickup. Went in at the appointed time. Was told it wasn\u2019t ready. Waited 25 minutes and was then given the wrong order. The customer whose order I took chased me down himself, on foot, a block away to tell me they had given me his food. So I went home empty-handed and then they brought me the correct order 20 minutes later.  2) Ordered for delivery directly from the restaurant. The ringer on my phone was accidentally turned off. When the delivery guy came, instead of just climbing 8 steps to the front door and buzzing the apt number written clearly on the receipt, he sat on his bike for over 10 minutes until I finally called the restaurant to see where he was. The food was cold.  3) Ordered from seamless,  just tonight. Upon completion of the order I was quoted a 7:25 delivery. Now, at 7:40, it says it will be coming at 8:00.  I really don\u2019t know why I keep ordering from this place. I don\u2019t think I will anymore. The food just isn\u2019t good enough to make these hassles worth it. That\u2019s my review of the ever-mediocre Bombay Heights. Good luck, and enjoy your meal.",
