The ingredients are fresh and very tasty. The composition of flavor is just excellent. Striking a great balance between protein and vegetables (without rice or noodles in my case).  The prices are very reasonable considering (this is Hawaii). My average bill was about $12 which I have no problem paying when the meals are fresh, tasty and full of flavor. The truck moves periodically to different spots so be sure to check where they will be located on the day. You can text phone orders as well. I've texted them a few times just to see what time they open and where they're located and I've always got a response which is great customer service.",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) Today's lunch has a good reputation and I could finally go to where I wanted to go. I got lost and ordered a garlic steak and shrimp combo. A knife while waiting? fork? The judgment is so amazing ! I don't mind waiting. Meat is just right and the sauce is delicious, so you can eat gohan just by itself. Shrimp is also pretty \u2606 Dressing and sauce are lined up in front of the counter, and I was told that there was homemade wasabi sauce and chili sauce, so I tried that too. It was delicious even if I put it on meat or salad. It was just the busiest time at noon, and it seemed that there were some other orders, but both the cashier and the chef were very polite and helpful. Here is definitely a steak in Hawaii. This time I will try salmon.
