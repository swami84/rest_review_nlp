The shoyu ramen broth smelled weird and was bland along with the miso ramen. The pork slices were thick, cold, and fatty. Everything was cold except for the broth (I ordered take out) and it wasn\u2019t hot enough to heat up the food. The fish cake tasted like they opened a can of tuna and slapped it on there.

If you don't want to risk being scammed use cash. I must admit the tip I gave was small only because:  1. My friend, who was with me, didn't want to give a tip as I received my ramen and gyoza long before she got her meal (which was just gyoza). 2. As a result of my friend not wanting to contribute I had to cover the tip myself and I didn't have enough on my card to give her a bigger tip.  Now my account is in the negative and my bank is charging me an overdraft fee as I literally gave all I could yesterday. I'm just appalled by the ethics of this place.",

I've always gone to them for good lunch deals and the fact that their staff is really friendly. The ramen itself has always been pretty good and fairly simple but nothing special. I stopped going in August and September and when I went back this month, I feel that they've been largely improved! They don't crack my favorite list of ramen spots in the city, but still a really great option. They do the classics of shio, shoyu, miso and a few other varieties (including a stir fry after they featured it in smorgasburg). If you want tonkotsu, there's Jin Ramen, which is a 8-10 minute walk at 125 and Broadway and they do a fantastic tonkotsu.",

We ordered two bowls of ramen, pork buns, and also some potstickers.  When we received the food, everything was incredibly cold and tasted spoiled.   I was completely grossed out! I decided to try the pork buns which are usually a favorite of mine but I couldn't even bite through the pork because it was so tough, not to mention flavorless.  The chicken in the miso was sour, the soft boiled egg was brown rubber, and the broth was salty and stale.  Overall, the quality of the food was inedible and we were completely disappointed. We decided to call the restaurant after only taking a few bites to try to get our money back because we didn't want to waste $45 on food we weren't able to eat. The owner told us he would come by to inspect and pick up the food which I thought was weird.  He arrived after ten minutes and proceeded to open the food and argue with us about the quality and try to get us to have them make it again despite my repeated refusal to try their food again during this transaction.  There was no way I was going to put any food they made into my body out of fear of food poisoning.  He was creepy and rude throughout and ended by saying he would go back to the restaurant and decide what to do later.  Here\u2019s the kicker\u2026 he TOOK our food with him! Not that we could have eaten it, but that\u2019s basically just stealing and taking our money as well as the merchandise and leaving us with nothing. We tried to give him a chance to make it better and told him that we didn\u2019t want to finish with a bad experience and then he argued with us, took our food, and walked off without giving us a response. That\u2019s all I have to say about that, oh, and don\u2019t give them your money unless you want cold spoiled food and food poisoning.",
