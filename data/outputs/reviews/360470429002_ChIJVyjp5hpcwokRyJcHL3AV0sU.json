I saw a review on \"Good Eats\" with Lauren Glassberg and wanted to give it a try to support but to my dismay I was not impressed with the overall service. I ordered the chicken and biscuit which was tasty(but way too much bread for me) and kale patties which I never got to taste after waiting nearly 1 hour.  The store opened at 1pm and I got there at 1:10pm, they had no change if you were paying cash and the young guy taking orders said the patties were in the oven and would be ready in 10 min. I shopped around the area, came back after 30 minutes still no text that my order was ready, after inquiring 50 minutes later he said he didnt know why the patties were not ready and didnt know how long it would be...really? I asked him to refund my money for everything and he said the chicken and biscuit was ready(sitting in the bag). I asked him why was the wait so long and he said they were having a bike event and preparing food and drinks for them. I heard enough, what type of business practice is that? a customer is a customer. If you cannot keep up with the volume and know in advance you are catering a event then close the establishment for the day. It isnt fair to keep customers ordering on site waiting for 1 hour for an order while you serve other customers in a park immediately. There was another gentleman waiting for so long and he also asked for a refund and left without his order. I  left there very disappointed and no desire to go back, first impressions are lasting. The food may be awesome but the service was lousy.",

As well, multiple people came in for pickup orders while we were there and ended up leaving without their food despite it having supposed to have been ready for half an hour at that point. One person in our party didn't get half of their order until after asking about it multiple times and waiting an extra 20 minutes.  I explicitly stated that I have a gluten allergy and needed the gluten free option listed on the menu (reiterated multiple times, it's fairly serious) and was reassured it would be done. Get my food the very last, after even people who came in after us, and asked to double check if it was the gluten free option. Was told it was. After I have already taken a bite the guy comes out and says \"Oh, no, that's the chia pita, not the gluten free option\" And was incredibly unaccomadating. I was understandably upset, so they remade my food (another 20 minutes). I'm pretty sure they just moved the dish to the other wrap and gave it back to me. I spent the next several days throwing up and struggling to walk because of their carelessness with a severe food allergy.  The food was mediocre, took unacceptably long to get, and I ended up spending my vacation puking my brains out instead of actually enjoying myself.",

Me and teo relatives each ordered one or two things to try. The jerked jackfruit, the fried mushroom sandwhich, side of homefries and lobster mac. They were amazing. The jackfruit was so full of flavour, not too spicy, just right. Fried mushroom was equally as amazing and even better that you get two sandwhich as part of that meal. I would say the lobster mac was my least favorite compared to everything else we order but still very good. If you don't have time to wait its better to call ahead but know that the food is 100% worth it. You will not be dissapointed at all. We also got a smoothie, I forgot the name but it had blueberries, mango and lavender! Best smoothie ever. So much love. I would recommend this place to anyone.",

        "caption": "I came from the northernmost tip of Manhattan (Inwood) to try Sol Sips as I had seen so much buzz about it online but knew no one who had actually eaten there. If you're taking a long trip, just know that seating is limited, it's crowded in there and that there are no bathrooms for customers so be prepared. The seating was only for nine, on stools inside and for two on a little cafe table outside. Since there was no order to the seating, it was every man/woman for themselves to grab a seat whether it's their turn or not and tolerate crumbs or oil on the tables. People who came in after me managed to get themselves seated while I was waiting on line. I waited my turn only to find out that people would come in behind me and take seats or have friends hold one down while the other party arrived. Very frustrating and confusing. I managed to get a bench seat at  a bench near the window and put a bag there while I placed my order. I sipped on a little juice while my food was being made, keeping the bathroom situation in mind (long ride there and back). My order wasn't at all like what I saw in a YouTube video. I did enjoy the oyster mushrooms and my drink but the waffles were dry and they didn't offer a topping. I asked for syrup but they only had agave---which wasn't tasty. I had to ask for a fork and knife. I only got a fork so I asked again. I never finished the waffles. A couple who wanted to sit together asked me to move from where I was on the bench so that they could eat together and try each other's food. I know I saw the woman earlier at a table to herself in the back so I wondered why she had moved to the bench until her party arrived. The whole Musical Chairs seating situation is frustrating and confusing. It should be regulated, somehow. I asked the owner, who was very friendly about what I saw in the video and she expressed that the biscuits were put on a waffle press the video. I therefore bought another meal to go so I could try what I saw but it made my experience there pricey. I wanted to give the food another try at home in more calm, comfortable surroundings. The vegan (oyster mushroom)  chicken and biscuits (pressed into two mini waffles) were indeed delicious with the innovative additions of avocado and raspberry jam. They do vegan chick'n right! The turmeric biscuits were a nice touch. I had a kale salad as separate side---it was okay. I would bring vegan friends as our favorite places in Manhattan closed down. We must prepare for a long ride of two trains, another long wait for food and cross our fingers for a seat. After all of that, there are no customer bathrooms.  We can just cover the tables with napkins if there is no wipe-down. That said, the stars are for the food and the mission. I still think it's important to support this business as they grow.  I'm sure they will.",

I ordered the \"lobster\" mac and cheese, while my mother ordered the \"chicken\" sandwich; we also got a smoothie, a cookie, home fries, and a side of avocado.  Starting with the main meals, I had to say overall that they were good. The mac and cheese was, well, cheesy, but with an overpowering seaweed flavor that they add with a poor addition of kale (I hate kale, but that's just me). The sandwich that I had tried was dry, lacked seasoning, and felt that the raspberry jam that comes with it doesn't mix well with the mix that comes with.  For the rest of our meal, the cookie was surprisingly good, being soft and chewy, while smoothie had a nice incorporation of flavors. The home fries were nearly over seasoned, but the ketchup or hot sauce makes a good balance (if you don't like either, they can stand good alone). The avocado was avocado, of course it was good.  For price and portion sizes, they tend to be good. All the food that we had came at a reasonable price for a reasonable portion size, and if you're a vegan it's definitely worth it. All I can really say is, do not get the avocado. $1.50 for maybe a quarter of an entire avocado is not worth it at all.  Though I have never eaten at a vegan restaurant prior, it was still very good, but as I said after eating, \"it's worth money, but not my money.\"",

I ordered a cookie along with the rest of my food and asked the employee at the front register if I can get my cookie in the meantime while I continue to wait. She said okay and gave me my cookie that I had already paid for. I\u2019m sitting down eating my cookie and I overhear the employees talking in the kitchen about the cashier giving me the cookie for free and she asks me if I paid for the cookie. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t be eating it if I didn\u2019t pay for it. Now mind you, this is a black owned business which I initially supported because I love to see young entrepreneurs especially of color making a name for themselves. I know that owning a restaurant isn\u2019t a piece of cake, however, being that this is the 2nd year that this restaurant is in business, there\u2019s no excuse for extremely slow and poor customer service. Instead of apologizing for their constant slow service, they don\u2019t even acknowledge it and I refuse to support a business that offers that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

        "caption": "As of this review I am still waiting on my primary order for a Chik'un Biscuit Sandwich and a Green Banana Tamale. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie and a lentil patty. When I placed my initial order at 2:17pm, I was told there would be a 35 minute wait. The time is currently 3:06pm and I was told my primary order will be an additional 15 minutes. This is disappointing as I made my decision to wait for the order based on the 35 minute wait time. 1hr 15minutes is unacceptable if I was not given the opportunity to determine if I was capable of waiting this long when my order was placed.  As per what I've eaten so far, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious - I give it a 5/5 and the lentil patty left some to be desired, so I give it a 3/5. When I finally receive my food I will either update this review or post a secondary one.  The staff is cordial. The kitchen is small and the demand is high, so understandably the food would take time to prepare. People are excited to support a vegan restaurant run by a young black woman. Me especially. My advice to the restaurant for future success is to under promise and over deliver. If you think an order will take 45 minutes, tell your customers it will be an hour to an hour 15. This way they can manage their time accordingly and not feel enslaved to waiting for a meal that should have arrived 25 minutes prior.  UPDATE: Around 3:20pm, my order still was not ready. I had to leave as I was supposed to have left by 3pm at the latest. One of the staff members (I'm assuming the manager) offered to comp my entire meal and give me a full refund when I informed them that I had to leave and could not wait any longer. I appreciated the gesture but did not want my meal comped because I wanted to support their business. While the staff member was assisting with the refund, another employee informed me the chik'un biscuit sandwich was ready, so I had that and the manager refunded my other order (green banana tamale). She also gave me a voucher for a comped meal on a following visit, which I appreciated. Because of the attempt to rectify the situation, I raised my rating from 3 stars to 4. The chik'un biscuit sandwich was very good. I give it a 4/5 because it could have used more jam and maybe another sauce, but the oyster mushroom \"chicken\" was phenomenal.  I likely will not come back on a weekend because the wait was overwhelming but the food was good. My advice to the staff and owners is to stay calm and kind under pressure. It is understood that you are overwhelmed with work because of high volume combined with a small kitchen but that is because business is good and the food is also, so that is a blessing! Look into ways to streamline your prep time and make high volume periods go by more easily. Take inventory of peak hours and biggest sellers and do as much advance prep and pre cooking as possible to ease tension in your kitchen until you move to a bigger space where you can hire more staff. Most importantly, under promise and over deliver. Worldwide Tacos in Los Angeles has a very small kitchen with insanely long wait times, but they are up front with their customers about wait times and overestimate instead of underestimating time necessary for food prep based on volume. Some customers may not be able to wait but some will and all will appreciate that their time was not taken for granted. We live in an era of speed, efficiency and schedules. People always have places to be. So make sure you are mindful of this. Overestimate your wait times and take phone numbers go call clients. You don't want the quality of your food and your service to be overshadowed by underestimated wait times.",

Genuinely confused why pancakes took an hour as my boyfriend ordered separate and that was all he ordered.

As a young woman from the same industry, I reeeeealllly want to give her 5 stars, but the main reason im giving 3 was due to the fact the sandwhich I ordered wasn\u2019t as phenomenal as I thought it would be. I can taste the care and thought into the Tamarind Jackfruit panini, however it was such a let down that the bread was actually a tortilla than a flat bread. Overall, the panini was monotoned and overpoweringly sweet. I love sweet BBQ dishes but the kale and bread was not substantial enough for the flavor and mount of tamarind jackfruit. I constantly found myself needing to wash of the sugary palate after a couple bites. Honestly. Would be great with something Smokey, like bell peppers to balance out the flavor. Maybe next time I\u2019ll try out their other dishes... sending growth and prosperity to the young owner.",

However, like I saw on a lot of other reviews the wait was just unnecessary long...I went with a friend and I waited an hour for my omelette, Mac and cheese and a juice and my friend waited over an hour for a latte and the pancakes. Makes the whole experience really not that pleasing when I personally paid 32 dollars to wait so long. The more frustrating thing was we saw people that came in AFTER us get their food first.

I asked to make a reservation being that we are from long island and wanted to secure a spot before driving an hour and a half to go eat (based on their reviews, I figured I should make a reservation because there is a clear lack of control regarding their efficiency). I understand it is a small place, and its hard to control the volume with their increasing popularity....but maybe at least try NOT to turn costumers away. Maybe instead try \u201cSunday is a really busy day so you will have to expect a long wait, or you can try coming on a week day\u201d something a bit more personal. Answering and NOT even introducing your business, halfway listening to me speak, and then saying youre better off not coming today.... doesnt seem like a great start. I was making a trip into brooklyn specifically and only to get food here, but i guess its a no go for me.",

It had no jerk flavor what so ever. The cook added so much pepper to the dish that while cooking it, the pepper smell became so strong that people started coughing in the place and the door had to be propped open which made it get cold in the establishment very fast. When the lack of seasoning was mentioned to the cook, she laughed and said we definitely season are food, & then said that the jerk jack fruit flavors were suppose to taste like that and suggested that I wasn\u2019t use to jerk flavoring (mind you I\u2019m West Indian and was raised on jerk flavors). I wanted this place to be a success & support it especially with it being a black owned vegan establishment.

So far I\u2019ve tried the Jackfruit panini, burdock root coffee on one to go visit uand then the dandelion coffee, \u201csea\u201d bowl, and banana muffin on another. Prices are decent for the quality of the food. My only issue was when, during my second visit, I found my \u201c sea\u201d bowl to not have any quinoa, which basically would of made this more enjoyable. Nonetheless I am happy to frequent this cozy vegan spot.",
