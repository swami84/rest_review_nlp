When you walk in the space is warm and inviting and it seems as though everyone knows each other. The first few minutes you feel like an outsider and then the staff puts you at east and starts treating you like a regular.  Chef Allen Dabagh displays the welcoming demeanor that the Lebanese are known for. Clearly, he's never met a stranger. It seems all the guests in the restaurant on Wednesday night were his friends or family. And the food! Oh the food!  Sitting at the chef's counter was like being in my grandmother's kitchen - if my grandmother had attended the French Culinary Institute. Mezze is my favorite way to eat. Small plates, spread over time. Different textures, flavors and temperatures - it's food for my ADHD brain! The menu starts with traditional Lebanese foundations: hummus, skewers, halloumi labneh, tahini, and then brings different modifiers (e.g. peas or beets in the hummus) and spices (sumac, dukkah, za'atar) blending them in creative ways. The results are lively and delicious. New twists on ancient food.  My only regret is that Allen was not serving Kibbeh Nayeh the night we went. His take on Lebanese steak tartare includes bulgur, puffed amaranth, sunflower seeds and spring onion! And it's served with homemade pita hot from the oven. Sounds like heaven!",

First, we went for brunch and we enjoyed it even though there were some hiccups with the eggs being cold in my shakshuka . They did the right thing and took it off the check which we appreciated. The bartender was very helpful. The waiter was nice but inexperienced. My boyfriend really enjoyed the hummus and avocado toast with egg. His eggs are also cold, but he's a dude so he ate them without complaint.  We went for dinner last night and Justin was our waiter and he was spot on at our table. Friendly, efficient, enthusiastic, and really did a great job of taking care of us. The foie gras fritters were beautifully presented and my boyfriend loved them.  The maitake mushroom dish was really delicious. I first I thought I wasn't going to like the sweetened Tahini with lime sauce, but it really worked. I think there were sesame seeds on it rather than caraway seeds but it was very good. We also had the pork chop with pears and enjoyed that as well.  The only weak dish was the Duck Pizza. You can't cook potatoes, even very thinly sliced ones in the time it takes to cook s pizza. I actually forgot they were potatoes and thought they were jicama which would have been an odd choice for a pizza topping. They didn't even taste like potatoes and the rawness detracted from the rest of the pizza. It was a shame because I love potatoes on pizza.",

The prices are ok. Around 236 dollars for 5 people with the drinks. Waiter (the Asian manager) was nice to us and chill. As they just opened, they still have to work on a few more details, so I'll guess you have to come in a few months again to see how it goes! The only bad thing was the music. Too loud and random awful house/pop songs. As the place has a cool design, and we're in Brooklyn, we were more in a mood for chill rnb, soul or old school hip-hop for the ambiance. No David Guetta though.",
