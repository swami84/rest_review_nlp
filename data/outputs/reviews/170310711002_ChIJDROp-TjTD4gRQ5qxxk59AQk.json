I'm half-Taiwanese and when I tried the boba (made in-house daily) it was so perfectly fresh and \"qq\" that I could have cried. The popcorn chicken is also a beautifully executed must-have, crispy and flavorful on the outside and juicy on the inside. Chicago is in desperate need of more good Taiwanese food, and this shop is a fantastic little addition. Highly recommend! I know I'll be coming back here many times.",

        "caption": "I first visited their Chinatown location and the tea was great, so I was happy to see they opened their new location near me.  Unfortunately,  they don't have Dan Bing here (egg crepe/ scallion pancake). Service was helpful,  friendly and quick! The self-service kiosk is great and they have touchless hand sanitizer spray that is not stingy. Regular milk tea was very tasty, roasted oolong milk tea was great and even the oolong with very little sugar was tasty! I love that they had a promotional buy one get one deal,  I hope they keep it up so my family can try different items.",
