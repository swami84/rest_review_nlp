Especially with what something like Eater might call an \"inventive\" menu (and others might call, at best, an *obscure* wine list), service is really the key to enjoying your meal, and finding what you are looking for in a hay stack of oddball varietals.

I get the Kanpachi collar as well as the Sea Urchin every single time. My favorite drink experience is the Rum Ti' Punch.

Spices and strong beautifully balanced flavours are at the center of attention supported by a good choice of wines. Not to mention that the place are all very very pretty, word of graphic designer.",
