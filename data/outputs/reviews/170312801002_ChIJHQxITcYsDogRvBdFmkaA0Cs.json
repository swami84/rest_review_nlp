The forced other businesses in the area to rebrand their shops, something that is not a quick and easy process, because they so badly wanted to hoard this title to themselves. These small family businesses were forced to comply with Aloha Poke's demands. There was never really serious, genuine cooperation. There is no real \"choice\" here. If they did not do this they face the threat of a major chain restaurant suing them and that could cost thousands more to small, sometimes struggling, local business owners. It's a blatant disrespect to a whole group of people who have already suffered the theft and appropriation of other parts of their culture  and this \"branding\" practice only shows the company's blatant tone deaf attitude and insensitivity to respecting Hawaiian culture.",

Oh yeah, and every one of their bowls contains jalapeno slices.  I asked for ponzu sauce and they told me that was the yuzu ranch... I dont think that Ranch is a beloved Japanese sauce. I got the Samurai sauce instead which was a drizzle of teriyaki. Not much of a loss as all the sauces appear to be mayonnaise based or otherwise disgusting.  There many bad reviews regarding a law suit about the name AlohaPoke, but I think that people shouldn't eat here purely based on how terrible the food is.

Subsequent visits I get a small spoonful of avocado - a single piece - often found at the bottom of my bowl. Sometimes I get orange tobiko, sometimes black. Sometimes the bowl is packed to the brim, other times, I get mostly rice. I try asking for the small sized price in the medium sized bowl, but they don't all the time acknowledge my request.

The idea of waiting more than three minutes to start stuffing my face was enough to make me swoon with hunger. However, the line snaking its way around the aisles seemed like a pretty good testament to the food. Squaring my shoulders, I braved the line. Thankfully, the staff was fast and efficient, and the wait wasn\u2019t too long after all. I decided on the middle-sized bowl, confusingly called the Big. For the poke, I went with the naked ahi. One thing I really loved about Aloha is that you can choose as many toppings as you want without having to pay extra. You can even get the 808, which is all the toppings. I got edamame, ginger, scallions, pineapple, and avocado. All the ingredients were extremely fresh. I\u2019m always a little wary about getting avocado at restaurants since it browns so quickly, but the avocado topping my bowl was green and pretty. The sesame vinaigrette was light and tasty (so tasty, in fact, that I\u2019ve been trying recreate it at home, but it\u2019s never quite the same). I encourage you to brave the lunch line at Aloha. It\u2019s definitely worth it.",

What I normally get: Big, White Rice, Marinated Tuna, \"808 Style\" with Yuzu Ranch and Spicy Aioli.

Aloha is new to the French Market and has gained a huge following since they opened not very long ago. I got there just after 11:30 on a Wednesday and there was already a line stretching down the aisle. The line moved rather quickly, but I noticed that as I waited, it continued to grow and had doubled in size by the time I got my food. I suggest getting there early if trying to go during the weekday lunch hours. The prices were acceptable for the generous portions offered. I will be back....probably more often than I should!",
