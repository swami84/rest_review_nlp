I don\u2019t know why so many people give it only one star. we\u2019ve ordered here 3 times and every time it\u2019s been so very good. Plenty of food for two people only $40 with delivery and tip through Seamless. Dishes we like are sesame chicken, hot and sour soup (but be careful it is really spicy), Gyoza (good two out of three times), California rolls, dumpling soup, spring rolls, and edamame. They are <2 miles away from our apartment and it usually takes only 15 minutes to arrive.",

I requested 4 rolls with no rice for keto. The only thing I wouldn\u2019t get again is the eel. There were way too many bones.  We also got their tri color summer rolls those were great!
