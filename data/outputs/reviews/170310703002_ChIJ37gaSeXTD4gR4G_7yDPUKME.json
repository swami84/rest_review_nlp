I do NOT recommend this place for groups, nor do i recommend the tasting menu. We did a group of 12, and while I was appreciative for all of their accommodations to allow us a large group, the restaurant requires you to participate in the tasting menu for this large of group (I believe it is true of any groups over 6). They gave use one dish of each PER 4 people. I did the math on this, and if you ordered all the tasting menu items al la carte it would come out to be roughly $30 per person versus the actual price of the tasting menu which was $65 (for 12 people that's an extra $420). It felt like a scam. Ultimately, I think I would go back, but I need some time to lick my wounds.",

It's a nice short walk after enjoying the holiday season light show in Lincoln Park Zoo  :) also because it's quite popular and late dinner time was the only time we can book. Make a reservation early if you can! We went for The Other Menu for $65 per person, thinking it would be nice to have a taste of everything they had to offer. For sure, we had some of the BEST pita and hummus in life (BUBBE'S BRISKET) - seriously, I can just eat the pita and hummus for a whole meal! Also had really original vegetarian dishes (CARROTS and BEETS) and great FALAFELS. CHICKEN THIGHS are really yummy and satisfying! I'd say for everything we have been served, food wise, it's a solid five-star! ***** :P For cocktails, I got the HERE LASSI LASSI, meh, not a big fan of the unexpected Asian spice taste in an alcohol drink :/ The only reason for the four-star is that our waitress messed up our order and somehow thought we were going for the regular menu (I didn't understand how that could possibly happen since she wrote down our specific picks for the Mezze and Hummus). As a result, they served some dishes of a larger size and missed some other dishes, leaving me confused of how The Other Menu really worked :/ Also the service was kinda slow. They did make it right by giving us some discount upon checkout, which was thoughtful :) Overall I'd say a 4.5-star is fair and def will come back again if I'm in Chicago!",

This is probably the best middle eastern flavors you can find in the city.  Great atmosphere and surprisingly good acoustic. The service can be pushy with some dishes (humus and falafel) but generally is okay. The food was amazing. We ordered the Flowering Fox, Salatim, Falafel, Potatoes, Halloumi, Chicken Thigh, Coconut Sorbet and If Elvis Went to Israel. The only down side was the falafel, which wasn't superior to a NafNaf one.  Highly recommend, will probably come again.",

The masabacha hummus was incredible and even the freshly baked pita bread was delicious. I also recommend the pumpkin tershi, falafel, Balkan stuffed cabbage and the basmati pilaf. For dessert, I recommend the baklava. The service was excellent, and the wait staff were very nice and helpful. If you're a fan of Middle Eastern food, you gotta try this place!",

For having a reservation I felt like we were getting the shaft- got seated at the counter in front of the kitchen and right by the front door. Since it was cold evening and the door kept opening, we were forced to keep our coats and scarves on the entire time. The kitchen in front of us was messy and looked quite unappetizing- the last thing I want to stare at while at dinner is plastic bins stacked up slopping around sauces and hummus. It took nearly 30 minutes just to get our cocktails, and then till about 40 minutes into the eve to be asked to order food. At that point we were cold, off-put by the kitchen, yet very hungry. Quite frankly nothing was that bad, about Galit, but it was all very disappointing. I was expecting homey Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food and instead had a decent cocktail and left cold/hungry.",

If you want your customers to pay for your employees' medical benefits, make sure your employees remember to fill water glasses and bring promised pitas to the table.

I actually loved the hummus, especially the one with the trumpet mushrooms.  Delicious. The salatine course was great.  Small little dishes with very flavorful foods. After this, I could not eat any more as the hummus really filled me up.  But I was happy to see all the dishes come out. We had the chicken thighs, Balkan stuffed cabbage, foie torchon, shakshukah and the cookie. Everything looked great and my friends loved it all. Would I go back?  On my own, no, but if my friends all wanted to go, I would!  But I would definitely not eat as much hummus as I did this time.  Drinks were very nice.

Without sounding cheap, we spent $240 between 3 people on a meal and we all walked away hungry. That seems quite unacceptable in 2020. Every dish we had was beyond exceptional, the chicken thigh actually blew me away. However to defend my position, the lamb chop ($32) came with one singular chop. We were basically fighting over it, and that makes no sense. Great food and questionable service leads to a run of the mill experience in a town where world class dining experiences are everywhere.",

The decor is great, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and our waitress was really nice and knowledgeable.  The food was great. But for the price, the portions were small. The chicken thigh was $18 for 1 thigh!  We got the Masabacha hummus, which was great! The pita was so fluffy and warm. We also got the Kubbeh Halab which was small but super delicious. The Falafel had great flavor and wasn't dry like most falafel. Lastly the steak was great, but again, small portion, especially if you are sharing with other people.  For dessert we got the sorbet (which was good but nothing different), the granada, and the philo dough cake. All were very fragrant and delicious.  I would go back but only for a special occasion.",

I had heard so many good things about Galit and had been waiting to find a good time to go for a few months. We did the tasting menu and it did not disappoint. The dishes were all small but we were quickly stuffed! The pita is perfectly fluffy, and goes perfectly with all of the dips and the hummus. We got the Jerusalem salad, the falafel, and the carrots as our sides. The falafel was some of the best I have ever had. The cabbage roll with lamb was also incredible. We loved everything we tried, and I think this was a great way to experience the menu for the first time. I definitely recommend for first timers!",

At a place with shared plates, we thought this was a bit irksome. -We felt a bit rushed. The moment we asked for the check they brought it. For a nice expensive dinner, someone in our partly pointed out you expect to be there for 2+ hours.

The city had high expectations for Galit's opening, chef Engel and business partner Andres Clavero exceeded the hype. patrons beware, very easy to fill up on salatim and humus alone. Save room for the the rest of the menu's delights. Small shareables allow diners the ability to try it all. The boutique eclectic offerings leave you eager for their next next seasonal dishes. Known for their wine pairings, the cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages are their lesser known delights. Excellent service. Great ambiance. Excited to see how these two shake up the Chicago food scene.",
