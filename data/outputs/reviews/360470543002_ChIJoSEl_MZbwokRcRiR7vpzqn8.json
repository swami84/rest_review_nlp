But before I get into that, my first experience at this spa was amazing. I first went early December, the front desk staff was great and helpful, my massage therapist Capri was amazing! He made me feel extremely comfortable and listened to any request I had as far as my focus points. He also recommended these wings that were really really good (pricey but good). He talked to me when I would tense up ensuring I could trust him and everything was great. After having such a great first experience I called to make a new appointment today, Capri weirdly didn\u2019t have any time on the calendar at all so I asked the front desk staff to pick the next best person. WORST MISTAKE. When I arrived and met with the new therapist \u201cRiina\u201d she seemed sweet, I explained to her my bother points and asked if she could dedicate 10 minutes out of my hour to these spots, she responded with \u201cI do this area this area then this then done\u201d. That rubbed me wrong since I am paying for a massage I should be giving some direction. It was a very painful massage I was tensing up and when she asked if I was ok I would say no it hurts when you do that and there was no response just a change in area. It honestly was a waste. I\u2019m in pain, super sore around my shoulders and when I went I wasn\u2019t in pain at all just was looking to be pampered. Even worse when I left out to go to the wet lounge there were no towels AT ALL. No one at the bar area and then I was told by the front desk person there was no food or drinks anymore just tea unless I was with a party or in vip.... as much emails as I get from this place daily none of them never mentioned stopping food service. I am just upset, disappointed and in pain. A waste of money and a waste of my time.",

The \"wet lounge\" could use some expansion. Very tight space that I can't imagine accomadating more than 10 people at once (comfortably). The steam room had a strange smell that was attempted to be masked with eucalyptus. Light fixture was also missing from the steam room. Most of the lockers weren't working. Be aware that if you book a 4hr spa party, that there aren't any complimentary items to gnosh on. Simply detox water until you eat (hours later). Also, one of my guests didn't receive the massage she was looking forward to because the spa double booked her a facial instead... Food was just ok. On the bright side, the staff is their saving grace! Our hostess Shaniece went above and beyond to satisfy our needs. The masseuses were absolutely amazing and the bartender was very accomadating. Won't be returning here but hopefully the owners are receptive to the feedback to ensure a pleasant experience for future guests.",

No communication between the staff so there were a lot of misunderstandings. Total WASTE of money. Paid for 60 minute massage in the package but only got 30 minutes because of their fault for holding us discussing payment details etc. we were there 30 minutes early and still started our massages late, when we asked for out full time and explained why it wasn\u2019t out fault, they refused to accommodate, stating they have more clients. The place was practically empty. The pictures I saw look way different from the actual place. Paid for a 5 star experience but got a 1 star experience. There are so many things that I could write but it would take pages. Never going back.",

This is not the behavior you want to walk into when it\u2019s your first time and you plan a day to relax. Front desk is the first impression and I was not pleased. When you walk in a facility where you are spending your money it should always be guest first. We should not have been able to hear conversations from the back while being ignored and waiting to be helped.  When I found the company on Groupon it said the coupon was for 2 people.  I called to confirm availabilities and details before purchasing. The receptionist  told me multiple times that this ticket for the VIP room allowed up to 4 people. After purchasing I called 2 more times to match up the information on the coupon and the info I was given. I said \u201c are you the woman I spoke with early about the Saturday 12pm Groupon?\u201d She said \u201cyes\u201d, and I proceeded \u201cJust to be sure my coupon says 2 people for the VIP and we are driving from new jersey but you told me for my Saturday appointment I could bring up to 4 including myself. Is it 2 people or 4?\u201d The woman answered  \u201c4\u201d.  After the 45 minute drive when we arrived only 2 of us were able to use the VIP room. I was very upset because I called multiple times to confirm a group of 2 and the receptionist ensured 4 was ok. When I told the receptionist this her response was \u201coh well that was our new receptionist so she doesn\u2019t know policy.\u201d We were not compensated for the false information. If you are training a new receptionist she should not be left alone to give out the wrong information, (our money and time should be just as important to the employees as to us because it\u2019s being invested into their business) but from the experience I had, The other receptionist were barely up front to help so that\u2019s probably why she gave out the wrong information. Overall the facility was beautiful and the masseuse were great and pleasant to be around. They are the faces and the attitudes you want to see when you walk into a spa, not the receptionist.  When I do spa again I will NOT return I Would rather spend my money somewhere where i am treated like a paying guest and like my time matters. Also when guest tell you it\u2019s their first time in your facility your top priority should be to make sure they return. Too bad the masseuse can be affected by the people you see before you get to them because it\u2019s all about presentation. I would not recommend someone to come here unless you want to yell hello to the back every time you need help. I felt like my time was wasted and I could have been enjoying myself with my friends at another spa. Which I intend to do next time.",

I only had to tell her my tender spots once and she was on it. An amazing experience. The room was dark, zen & a total escape.  As far as the ambiance of the wet & dry lounge that was awesome also. I saw reviews about the \u201cquality\u201d of furniture and it not being as upscale as it appears online, which I agree to an extent (tables & furniture in the dry lounge had rips & marks & weren\u2019t \u201cluxury\u201d) but that didn\u2019t take away from my experience at all. Everything was clean, very spacious and I had no issues. The locker room was clean & spotless and very nice. They had razors available, shaving cream, cotton swabs, & blow dryers. Everything was clean & organized.  The staff were very nice. The bartender was very friendly, asked me why I was there & if there was a special occasion & when I told her it was my birthday she was super engaged and pleasant. LOVED my experience there 100%.",

Front Desk staff was pretty nice and polite. The locker room was a regular standard locker room, the temperature in the sauna was great but had a weird smell. The Jacuzzi was pretty small only about 4-5 people fit. When it comes to food and drinks they are robbing people. All the food is purchased by the market they have on the same block that they sell for doubled the price. The drinks aren't made by licence bartenders, front desk staff make the drinks which weren't all that great and also expensive. As for the massage itself, it was great I don't remember his name but I left feeling like a new person. The way management speaks to their employees is horrible, this place has major potential just need a few minor adjustments and new management.",

I wasnt aware of that. They young told me she call both numbers when she lied about it. She called the wrong number. So they are not giving the refund. I believe its wrong since they told other people I know whom goes there told them 24 hours in advance like I did. It'snot about the money. The part that really disappointed me was they said the manager was going to call me back. They never did. They were never going to call. That's poor integrity of the business. I've been there before, Never had a problem. The ethics of this establishment has changed. They lost my business. It's not a bad place , just poor service.",

The sauna was dangerous -wooden chairs had splinters and the nails were coming out which stated \u201ccareful dangerous to touch\u201d.  Hands down the worst spa/customer service experience I have had in life.  Sad because I wanted to support a local business. Will not be returning.  A spa experience should be relaxing starting from the moment you enter with staff and they failed to even service that.  Wish I remembered to take photos.

I called on Saturday July 7 the following week and finally spoke to the manager named Dimitri. He told me my refund process did not fully go through and had to redo it again.

All over the building you will see a promotion stating, if you leave a Yelp review you will receive a 10% discount. Upon completion of services when I attempted to call in on the ad, I was told a discount will only be granted if I provide a 5 star review. You can imagine after the experience my group of 12 had, there was no way I would offer a 5 star anything. I notified the manager that these scheme she presented to me was extortion. It is illegal to barter discounted services for undeserved reviews. I will never visit Body by Brooklyn again. Ms. Rose needs to either be instructed to take management courses or be deleted demoted. They manner in which she handled today's events demonstrates her inept aptitude in customer service. I had a wonderful treatment but it was ruined by incompetent management.",

Other than my spa preference, Ron is the best massage therapist at Body by Brooklyn.",

The menu for their lounge needs to feature more authentic food, not nachos and Sabra Hummus.  When the receptionist offered to make the drinks for us, we had to return the drinks because the wine tasted like juice and seltzer. Even worst, a glass was dirty with what seemed like a lip mark. Then came the massage to save the day, right?  WRONG!!!  There was an obvious space heater in the room. Not the cute executive professional type, no, it was like the tall Lasko towers :-(  What is going on?!?   Five minutes into the massage, the WiFi went down. As a result the zen like spa music shut down in the rooms and you can hear everything in the corridor throughout the massage.  Not cool.  1 of my friends came from out of town and I apologized to her and the other ladies for the experience repeatedly. This could have been one of their worst days ever, but there were no apologies or any form of restitution which led me to believe this was their new norm.  Body By Brooklyn has so much potential, but clearly the standards are low.    I hope they get it together soon, it use to be one of my favorite places to relax.",

I asked if I could leave and get food: answer NO. I was offered chips and salsa; whaaat??? That's what you eat BEFORE food. I was told there's a cook with a menu on the weekends. Ok that's great, it's Monday and Im hungry now ...  They have a great drink menu, but I wouldn't know because \"they had 2 party's over the weekend and they were all out. Ya don't say, you had a multiple groups of people during Superbowl weekend?!  Shocker! That's great what about the patrons on Monday, guess we don't matter ... so after being told no to numerous drinks on the menu I finally choose a $10 drink. Which cost me $10.88 when I checked out. Principle not point.  Obviously it's Brooklyn, so no parking.  They don't monitor the areas: multiple people using flash to take their selfies and speaking loudly in the wet area. Steam room = just a warm room.  Suggestion: washcloths in the shower area??? Rather than plastic bags for our wet clothing, why not a spinner to dry bathing suits?  Pros: Robes large enough for a plus sized girl like me. There's a groupon",

The VIP room would hv been great I guess I\u2019d rhe music and the TV worked. I informed the Manager of this issue before we even got to enjoy the room it was a gift for the hubby.  I also thought that was part of my price. I asked being that these two devices don\u2019t work is there something being taken off. She instantly said NO! very firmly. Then she went on to say \u201cYou people open the Champagne and ate the chips. Ok  that is true but we thought the the items was going to be fixed. We were in the room for a hot 10-15 min. So nothing was fully consumed. She was very rude up until I told her I wasn\u2019t there to argue with her, and that I was in the law enforcement field she changed her tune. It shouldnt have went that far. She should have tryed to find a solution. Needless to say I had to cancel the VIP room. And that part of my husbands gift was reined. The place itself is great the manager is the worst!!!She needs people skills.  If the manager can\u2019t assist with issues that the customer is having what good is she/him.",

The first lady that answered the phone told me that they had availability for the date that I wanted to book however,  Samantha came on the line 2 minutes later and informed me that they were booked.  I attempted to explain that the other lady just told me the they had some slots and if she can double check just to make sure. Samantha refused to check.  Samantha's attitude was extremely rude and unprofessional.  She proceeded to tell me that I should go to another place.  Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.  In fact, I hope everyone goes to another place. I refuse to patronize a store that behaves as if they are doing me a favor. Please everyone, do yourselves a solid and stay far away from this place.",

If that's a way to entice people back it's not. Looking at other reviews I wonder if this was Kristal?  Rude and uninviting. Would recommend going elsewhere",

        "caption": "My Body By Brooklyn experience was less than desirable. My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to go here after the Brooklyn Half Marathon on March 16, 2015.  I will start with the so called pros:  1. There was a decent amount of parking directly in front of the building; 2. they only have three showers, but they are huge and can fit a half dozen people inside one; and 3. the staff, although they could have been a little bit more on the professional side, they weren't horrible. The restaurant/bar area was ok, but not very tidy. The sauna/steam room area was cool in that it was co-ed, but the cold plunge pool was out of order - not that anyone was really interested in plunging into a pool of cold water anyway.  I purchased the Swedish massage - which is my favorite and I get a Swedish massage at least once a month. My massage was set to start at either 2 or 3pm and my therapist's name was Boris. I arrived at the waiting area approximately 8 minutes before my scheduled massage. However, my therapist didn't show up until 20 minutes later. I was waiting so long, that I asked the person (who I assumed was the manager) to make sure I had the time correct. She came back and said that he should be out shortly. I then waited another 10 minutes. When Boris come out to greet me, he looked a little weird and was speak so low that I had to keep asking him to repeat himself. It was as if he was high or something.  When we got into the room, I explained to him that I was ticklish on my knees (I know it sounds crazy), but if he could please not touch that area b/c it is uncomfortable. He told me to lie on my back. face up - which I thought was strange. Like I said above, I get massages all the time and I've been asked to start my massage laying on my back. When he came back into the room, he told me to put both arms behind my head and started to apply lotion under my arm right next to my armpit which is a very sensitive area. I had the right mind to get up and leave but my body was exhausted from the race and I really didn't want to make a scene. He kept just lightly touching me with lotion and then when he got to my knees, he kept touching my knee! I informed him on several occasions to stop touching my knee and to also stop just applying lotion. I paid for a massage and expect that. He kept apologizing but doing the same thing. When I turned on to my stomach, he never really massaged my back but kept trying to tickle my arm, putting his fingers in my toes, and pressing my head into the massage table. I finally made him stop because I was so tense and uncomfortable that I could not take it anymore.  I felt so violated and disgusted that I immediately went to the front desk and complained. The young lady look at me with a blank stare and very much uninterested in what I had to say. I asked if anyone else ever complained about this guy and she said \u201cnever\u201d. At this point, I was in a rush and didn't have time to take it to a manager.  I'm not a complainer, but I have to say that it was the worst experience of my life!  If you ever go to Body By Brooklyn, I would advise you to NEVER get a massage from Boris.",

I've lived in Fort Greene for almost two decades... we have come a long way huh?! That a large spa would land in this celebrated and now moneyed hood is no shocker. I was gifted a massage a year ago and finally got the chance to redeem yesterday. To get to the point: the massage itself (administered by Kevin) was fantastic. That dude was a pro. But the facilities (or \"wet lounge\" in BBB-speak) are quite mediocre. I read here before my visit that the hot tub was maintained at 95 degrees, and I was sure that must've been a one-time issue. But that was exactly the lukewarm temperature all day long. Not a pleasurable Jacuzzi experience. I'm sure there's regulatory mandates at work but does a 20 square foot hot tub have to print it's 2'6\" depth around the perimeter eleven times in large type? Eleven! Weird distracting design things like this are in abundance. There's no silence in the sauna or steam room: Hasids volunteer technology gadget reviews in broken Yiddish and heavily tattooed gangster types mumble to themselves. The steam room was not adequately steamy. Towels ran out. And lastly: the ~$10 remainder of a $100 deposit to reserve the appointment was not refunded, even though I was told it would be on the phone. Not worth arguing about, but certified the fact I will never return. Body By Brooklyn is overpriced and under delivers. I'd go further afield next time to get a more relaxing, hotter hot tub experience.",

After my facial I went into the sauna and fell into a truly blissful and serene state--something that every college student needs to escape to every now and then!  The other great thing about Body by Brooklyn is that they have a Martini Lounge! Although I didn't go in as part of my visit, it looked as though all the customers inside the lounge were having a great time. I also saw that there were private parties and catered events, something that not every spa in the area has. I would definitely book a party here for an event such as a birthday party or a reunion of some type with close friends.

Service was friendly and professional and everyone I came into contact with either greeted me or asked if they could do anything for me.  I went for a 90 minute deep tissue and 30 minute reflexology massage - definitely two of the best treatments I've ever had, and I'm pretty big into both.  It wasn't my plan, but I did get a pedicure I was really happy with - I can't speak to the color selection because I use my own polish.  The facilities are super clean and spacious, and I probably should have gone for the wet lounge/steam room, but I was pressed for time and was on a mission to get the horrible knots out of my shoulders and restore my feet to normalcy.

The Russian Sauna alone would be worth the price, but what I wasn\u2019t expecting was the ease of relaxing, where none of the staff were anything but calm and helpful all day. No one tried to push extra services on me, though they were available. I left feeling more rejuvenated than I have at spas that cost three times as much!",

Yet it is more than a spa.  It is self-indulgence without the guilty feeling.  It is pure bliss.  And it is all made that more enjoyable by the wonderful staff that caters to your every need. I have found a home away from home.  This is my own little oasis of peace, serenity when not vacationing.  It is almost like taking a vacation in Brooklyn; and enjoying every moment of it.  I have already picked up a few gift certificates for Mothers' Day.",

The place I saw was clean and spacious, with plenty of room to relax.  All day wet lounge passes were well worth it.  The staff was friendly, courteous, and seemed pretty serious about making sure we had a good time.",

Without going into too many details of the services she enjoyed there, I can tell any guy out there that if they want to score major points while doing practically nothing (outside of sending their wives out for the day) send them here.  She felt like she spent a bit much, but for a spa of the quality she described, I didn't think so at all, and for how relaxed and happy she was upon coming home, I'll send her back at least once more before the year is out.",

I got a gift certificate for Christmas from my mom, she always gets me massages and I had the \"Concrete Jungle Juice\" cocktail and then the deep tissue massage.  Needless to say it was relaxing, after the pain...but that's cause I carry a lot of tension, who knew, I thought I was much chiller!??!!!!  Anyway, I go once a year for massages, but after hitting this place last week, i\"ll probably try to change that and go three-four times a year, after all I deserve it!",

        "caption": "Body By Brooklyn is the WORST experience you can hope to pay for!!!! It is the most lame excuse for a Spa after the appeal of the asthetic which is quite worn in now, wore off.  Completely useless staff that are totally ignorant about the industry or even basic elements of service, treatment and professional behavior. A clear sign of NO training what so ever and not attention payed to hiring qualifications.  It appears as though the manager has hired all of her friends whom all consort to cover her butt as she must be the worst manager I have EVER had to confront on a professional matter.  I have been to this spa about 4 times, each time thinking it would get better after incessant complaining from day 1: when the jacuzzi was at 98 degrees for the entire day and the so called bar was basically out of ever liquor one ordered. Staff on cellphones and eating food in plain view.... all the while having not a CLUE as to what they are there for.  The last straw was yesterday when I took 6 of my staff members there for a staff appreciation day / holiday party. I got everyone mani-pedicures and lunch. I spent over $500 collectively throughout the day including a big FAT tip for the esthetician and bar tender - the ONLY two who had a clue).  THE JACUZZI WAS AT 96 degrees the ENTIRE day!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $500.00 and not a drop of hot water. The management is AWFUL and was no where to be found throughout the day when all 15-20 of us in the Wet Lounge were complaining about the water temperature while sitting in a jacuzzi that was colder then our body temperatures. All complaints were met with a bulls@#t story that they have been telling since the first day I had had the jacuzzi issue 6 weeks prior.... \"it takes a while for the jacuzzi to get warm\" (it was 12 noon, they open at 10:30am), \"it looses warmth throughout the day\" (I have managed fitness centers with jacuzzi's... this is a lie), \"there is no way for us to adjust the temperature\" (also a lie)... So basically, you can complain that the water is cold and they agree with you that it is cold (yet will state that it is \"actually\" 2 degrees hotter then it reads), and that it should be warm)er), but they can't fix the problem within 6 weeks let alone within the time it would take to appease a customer.  Nor will they compensate an individual who fell victom to their inability to run a business and do their job. When I checked out and asked if the manager thought I had the experience they looked to deliver, she simply back tracked and side stepped knowing full well that the simple fact of having her jacuzzi off line was catastrophic.  After having had visited several times before in the midst of complaints, I THEN bring in 6 people on my dime, spend over $500.00, your establishment drops the ball on the day and guess what??? She comped me one drink for my troubles...  WORST MANAGEMENT EVER!!!!!!!!!!! Clueless meets Dumb and Dubmer - why are you a manager?!?!?  what are you doing in NYC?!?!? Go stock shelves in Nebraska  BBB, Thank you for one of the worst experiences in my consumer life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh, and the food sucks, the flip flops break and also are VERY slippery (let your lawyer know). Watch out for the stains on the towels and bathrobes..... not sure what they're from.  You will NEVER find a tatter / fray free towel as they all seem to be purchased (or gifted) from the lost and found bin on planet Funktopia.  On Funktopia, everyone is filthy.",
