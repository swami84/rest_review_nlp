The server provided great service. The Strawberry mimosas were delicious. We ended up buying 2 pitchers lol. I had the spicy feta cheese omelet and we shared the Kanela French toast. We wanted to try the red velvet French toast but the server mentioned they were out? (at 9am) which was odd. But nevertheless everything was made to perfection. Will need to come again!",

I also tried their chicken and waffles and while it doesn't compare to South Carolina's Poogan's Porch, it surprisingly comes close! They present their food well and tastes exceptionally well on top of it! I know they'll become more and more popular soon, and I'm glad I finally know about them. Cheers!",

She ordered: eggs Benedict with side salad and matcha smoothie. My order: chilaquiles and berry blast smoothie. Our serve was very nice. There was no wait so we were sat quickly. Brought us a jug of room temperature water with two cups. No ice. To give the benefit of the doubt we could\u2019ve asked for some. Anyways. Friend said smoothies were good which I agree they were delicious. She was satisfied with her dish. Now I couldn\u2019t say the same. It was watery and had a funny taste to it. Now i understand a business is a business and we should pay for services of course. I conveyed to the server that I wasn\u2019t too fond of the dish and if I could have an omelette instead and she responds nicely saying she can put the order in but just so I know that my original dish can not be taken off bill. I said ok. My omelette was delicious no problem. Our bill was $58.86 because they indeed did not remove the dish. I payed in cash $60 and the waiter returned and placed $3 exact on the table. Now I\u2019m not cheap I tip very well at restaurants, having worked as a cashier and waitress many time before, though it was only 0.15 which I would could care less honestly I just think it\u2019s the principle of the thing to bring back someone\u2019s change or to at least ask if I could like the coins not just take it upon yourself and not give exact change back even after still charging me for a dish that wasn\u2019t satisfactory. Needless to say I wouldn\u2019t be back anytime soon. Perhaps will try one of their other locations.",

We go there late on a Saturday morning, got seated reasonably quickly, and then it all went downhill from there. Service was so slow- took ages to get our menus, then to order. I'm pretty sure they forgot our food order, since we were waiting 20-30 minutes for all the dishes. There were other patrons who arrived after us, who got their food and ate and paid, all while we were still waiting for ours. Two out of the four dishes were incorrect- my friend's was missing the toast, and the fresh queso. Mine was the easiest dish, just mac and cheese, and it was the last thing to come out, after 30 minutes. It wasn't cooked through (the cheese was not melted on top), was missing the breadcrumbs, and clearly hadn't been baked as stated on the menu. The waitress apologized halfheartedly for the wait, but she barely checked in on us and never offered refills or anything, didn't even check how our food was once it finally arrived. I get if there's a rush in the kitchen or something, but this was bad service and bad food combined. To add insult to injury, not 30 minutes after eating (having eaten nothing else that day), I got sick. So not worth it.",

I ordered the Lorraine scramble and it was meh..no cheese and very little onion or bacon and it made me sad. My other daughter ordered the hash and it had brussel sprouts as one of  the ingredients which was stated and which is loved by all of us but just didn't taste good in the hash. The la Columbe coffee is yummy but the latte even with an extra shot was pretty weak...I needed my caffeine! The waffle was nice and I think the girls french toast was too but didn't try it. Will go again for that spicy feta omelette for sure but not the Lorraine or the brussel sprout hash",

Pretty loud environment, a bit difficult to have a conversation, although we were sitting near the kitchen area. They forgot one of our side orders but charged us for it until we said something. I was anxious to try this place due to some of their interesting menu options as well as the La Columbe coffee they serve, but the latte I ordered was made very poorly. Felt a bit let down after reading all of the online hype about this place. No waiting area so make sure you get on their waiting list in advance via Yelp.",

Service by Noah was spot on.  Everything came hot and fresh, this was the kanela club I was expecting.  First time visiting on a very uncrowded Friday morning.  Flavors were great, execution was lacking.  I had fried chicken and waffles, they sat in the window for 5 min before my wife's Benedict was ready.  Her poached eggs were so barely runny that it was sad.  To bad too, service was good, food tasted great, but they failed to bring it all together.  Wasn't worth sending back, just slightly disappointing for such an esteemed breakfast place.",

My server, Noah, was pleasant and courteous, but the food was brought to me by a  busser, whose name I don\u2019t know ( I remember she had tattoos on both arms), but man.. I got disgusted by her. She had a sleeveless, highly cropped top, which showed way more than I would like to see from someone serving food( talking about her chest and underarms). On top of that, her long hair was not pulled in a tail or otherwise secured. Instead, I had to wonder the whole time if peaces of her hair will end up in my food or perhaps someone else\u2019s. Yuck. The music was very loud and it wasn\u2019t pleasant to eat in such noisy environment. The staff would talk loudly across the room and it was annoying. When I first arrived the hostess spoke with me coldly and she didn\u2019t even bother to say goodbye when I was leaving- I sat very close to her desk, so she saw me. Overall I wouldn\u2019t bother going back.",
