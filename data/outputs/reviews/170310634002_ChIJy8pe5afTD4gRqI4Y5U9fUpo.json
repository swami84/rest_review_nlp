On top of this, there is a \u201c5% discount\u201d for using cash, which is a bit odd considering the current pandemic, but I assume they are just trying to offset transaction costs, so take that as you will.  The most alarming part though was a large sign regarding COVID-19 and prepared foods with circled text specifically about your stomach inactivating the virus. I noticed the cook did not wear a mask while preparing the food and the cashier was hardly wearing one properly, so I\u2019m assuming they have had complaints prior to this. For the amount of signs inside regarding social distancing, I would assume they would take the appropriate precautions of their own.  Best to just stay away.",

Joseph and Anna make every single sandwhich with their heart and soul and you can really see the passion that goes into Joseph's work as he crafts each like a masterpiece. The combination of flavors is intense. Warm bread and premium meats and cheeses, expertly brought together with organic greens and delicious sauces to make the perfect sandwhich. They also make amazing juices that make for a great pick me up or a delicious healthy desert. They also have free wifi and a cozy setting to eat, work, and just relax! Personally sandwhiches are my favorite food so I do not offer a review like this lightly, but I can honestly say that after 4 years of living here and searching, I am so thankful to have finally found my Chicago sandwhich shop. See you soon!",

        "caption": "On a temperate Saturday in March, the guy working in Aje Cafe told my girlfriend that they were closing and she had to leave. She had 4 large bags with her, which I had left with her so I could run a quick errand up the block, so she asked if she could stay and hang out for another 5 minutes while he closed up while her boyfriend came back to help her with her bags.  The man working said, quote, \"I'm F***ING TIRED of this S***, get out right now,\" quite aggressively, then said something about \"working a hundred hours a week.\" When I returned to the cafe, she was sitting on the doorstep of the shop next door literally crying.  My girlfriend is a kind, quiet, introverted girl who likes to read and spend her time in libraries (she had been reading Nabokov in Aje Cafe) - think Belle from Beauty in the Beast, if she had to be a Disney princess - so I know she would not have asked for 5 minutes rudely or aggressively. And worse, the man inside was still behind the counter cleaning when I arrived, so she would not have prevented him from leaving the cafe by staying.  I've been to Aje Cafe many times, and the staff has always generally unpleasant and unhappy, especially if you tell them their WiFi password doesn't work (I was effectively told that I don't understand how to operate computers for 5 minutes, after which the barista realized the internet had cut out and she had to restart their router), but the food was always alright, so whatever, no big deal. But this was unacceptable.  There's a Peet's Coffee & Tea literally a block north on Clark Street, and everyone there is always VERY friendly and the atmosphere is just as cozy (and always cleaner) than at Aje Cafe. If you go just a few blocks further north to Belmont, then you'll find Kickstand Espresso Bar, which serves superior coffee and has a much friendlier vibe. Go to either of these places.  There is no reason to support Aje Cafe and its ungrateful, unfriendly staff. Go elsewhere.  And by the way: take their relatively high rating online with a grain of salt. Chicagoans, especially people living in Lakeview, love to pride themselves on \"shopping local\" and \"supporting local business.\" Literally half of the 5-star reviews this place has gotten are completely based on the fact that they're a local cafe and not a large chain. Seriously. The fact that this place isn't Starbucks or Peet's automatically gets it a high rating from other people. But \"local\" doesn't mean \"good\" if everyone is a jerk.",

I brushed it off and thought perhaps she was having a bad day. The sandwich and salad I ordered were flavorful, albeit small portions for the price. Overall, I was unimpressed. I went back a second time for a coffee. The same woman was just as unpleasant as the first time I ordered. I asked for a small coffee in a medium cup, and she just stared at me. I reiterated my order. She looked at (who I presume to be) the owner, and shrugged. I looked at them both, confused by what I could have said to cause this. Anyway, I get the coffee - and it's basically hot water. I put in two packets of sugar for about 14 oz. of liquid - and all I can taste is sugar. I don't think I'll be back.",
