        "caption": "This restaurant/pub brought me back in time to our trip to Ireland in September of 2018 where we got engaged! Strandhill Public is a brand new Irish restaurant in Tampa Heights located next to Armature Works in the bottom of the Pearl apartment building. They have the same concept in Brandon and I\u2019m glad they decided to open a second location in Tampa! The owner is an Irishman passionate about hospitality, great food the & amazing cocktails. A lot of his dishes and & drinks were inspiration from his mother, so you already know it has to be 5 stars! From the second we walked in, we were transported to an Irish Pub with an upscale feel. The walls were decked with pictures of from the Coastal West of Ireland and immediately set the vibe for our date night.  We were greeted politely by our server, Nema and received our first round of drinks: the Fitzgerald\u2019s Cousin. It\u2019s a Irish gin drink with blood orange pur\u00e9e, lemon and rhubarb bitters. This drink was so amazing, I could have chugged 10 of them. Even if you\u2019re not a gin drinker... just get this cocktail and it will blow your mind. Next night out I\u2019m seriously coming back for multiple!  The appetizers were P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L seriously better appetizers than we actually had in Ireland. We order the Drunken Mussels and the 6 Minute Irish Egg. The mussels will be a must order for us everytime we visit and so will the Irish Egg. The mussels were saut\u00e9ed in a garlic, white wine, chili paste broth drizzled with a curry aioli and they blew my mind. If you\u2019re someone who thinks they don\u2019t like curry, let these mussels change your mind! The 6 Minute Irish Egg is a slightly runny, boiled egg wrapped in house seasoned pork, panko fried then plated with a hollandaise sauce. My only regret about this egg was that I had to share it with my fianc\u00e9!  Next up was our entrees and they also didn\u2019t disappoint! My fianc\u00e9 got the traditional Irish breakfast (for dinner) since we\u2019ve been yearning for it for the past two years. The breakfast was just like we had so many morning waking up in Ireland, except the Irish Soda Bread was different. I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Irish Soda Bread in Ireland and this one blew me away! It was so fresh and had such amazing flavor. This bread is baked in house everyday & you can tell that makes all the difference! In the mood for something else, I ordered the pan seared salmon and it was prepared sooo well! The salmon and asparagus were perfectly and the black pepper mornay was amazing.  Finishing out our experience we had the Banoffe Pie and the Five Farms Irish Cream Coffee. Both were unbelievably great! The Banoffe pie is a caramel, banana mousse in a shortbread crust topped with a toasted meringue.... another item I\u2019ll be ordering every time! We cannot wait to get back here and share this place with all of our friends! Thank you to Strandhill Public for the outstanding & authentic Irish experience!",

Collectively, our table got the Irish 79, bloody Mary, and salty dog.  The bloody Mary was not a favorite, but it wasn't bad.  We ate the six minute egg, which was amazing.  We also had the full Irish breakfast, bangers and mash,  chicken biscuit, and croque madame.  Each person was very happy with their food and the portion sizes were great.  The one odd thing was the staff didn't have brown sauce or know what it was.  This seems like a really weird oversight.  We have asked that they start stocking it.  The drink list is pretty good with a good number of regional beers.   I'll definitely be back!",
