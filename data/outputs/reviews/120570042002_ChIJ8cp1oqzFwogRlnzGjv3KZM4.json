The tomatoes were old. Not worth the money. I had to order a pizza from another place after spending $15 on this small plate. Also I am Mediterranean and this is nothing Mediterranean. I decided to give it chance even though every time I go to armature works there\u2019s no one ordering from there and I wish I never ordered either. Absolutely horrible, waste of money and a disgrace to the Mediterranean food. That\u2019s why there\u2019s never anyone ordering there.",

By the way, there was only one other customer, so not exactly a mistake due to rush hour. The employee to customer ratio was plentiful. The other customer, who ordered after me, received their order before I received my fairly simple salad. It was weird.",
