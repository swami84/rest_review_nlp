Due to Covid-19 restrictions, we orderd and picked up.  The Chef was extremely accommodating offering items I requested that were not on the menu and the food was superb- Filet w Peppercorns, Steak Frites, Cheese Platters, Truffle Sauce.,. He even waited to plate our hot vs cold food until we arrived so that it would be perfect and IT WAS!  I wish that I would have ordered the escargot pastry but forgot.  When covid restrictions are over for indoor dining- I will be driving in from the suburbs with a group and take one of everything!  Amazing \ud83d\udc4f",

Google says it opens at 5:00. We got there at 5:00, door locked, dark inside. We waited a few minutes thinking they might be just running a little late. At about 5:10 I call, and a frenchman answers to tell me they'll open \"about 5:30.\" We decide to wait. Finally at 5:30 the doors are unlocked and we walk in. A French waiter \"greeted\" us rather coldly, and sat us in the far, far back of an empty restaurant. In hindsight, it's telling that his first question was \"Do you live in the building.\" (it's located on the 1st floor of a high-rise apartment building) When I said \"No, we're just doing a fun day trip in the city\" . . . Game over.  From that point forward, at every chance he could, he was very rude and condescending. To the point of absurdity. Like he was auditioning for the role of \"rude French waiter.\" And the oddest part was how over-the-top charming he was with others who began to straggle in. They seemed to be regulars who presumably live in the neighborhood, and for them he adopted a strange saccharine charisma. It was very weird. I felt like we were in a David Lynch movie, or maybe being punked by some hidden camera show. I should point out  that we'd been in a good mood and were polite and respectful to him -- after all, we were trying to have fun on our special day in the city \u2014 but he was the opposite. For some reason, he seemed to decide we weren't worth his time and trouble. The result was this kind of sad, icky feeling we had as we drove home. The food was truly delectable, so there's that. I guess, if you don't live in the neighborhood, consider lying. It might be your only way to get decent service. I can't think of any other explanation for what we saw and experienced.",

We arrived just after 8.30pm on a Friday and decided fairly quickly on our order.  Unfortunately the French onion soup was not available and, as we didn\u2019t want any of the other starters we said we\u2019d go straight to mains, as we had our eye on the cheeseboard, instead of desserts.  My wife asked for the boeuf bourguignon - no beef bourguignon.  Duck?  No canard.  Lamb?  Oui.  I tentatively asked for the calves liver.  Oui.  (Thank god!)  My wife let out a small yeeaayy and was promptly told off as \u201cwe were late and that\u2019s why all the fresh food had gone\u201d.  I did not escape his disdain either, as I had ordered a Diet Coke instead of the obligatory French red wine.  \u201cYou are not drinking? Pfffttt!\u201d  \u201cNo\u201d I said, and muttering \u201csorry(!)\u201d  Before the food came out he suddenly appeared at the table to tell us that the food was nearly ready as he had started to cook it immediately we ordered.  We thanked him profusely for the update, even though we were sure we had not shown any signs of impatience.  Luckily the food was really nice; although he said we wouldn\u2019t need any sides, when really the portion sizes required at least one each.  The waiter then asked if we wanted to look at the desserts menu, but the owner butted in and told him that we wanted the cheeseboard and to bring more dry white bread.  Again the cheese was nice but there could have been more for the $9  The final act of brusqueness was when we spotted that he had added $71 and $7 and got $77 and he thought we were disagreeing with the bill and came over to ask \u201cis there something wrong with the bill?\u201d  We meekly said \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine\u201d, paid and left.",

The doorman at the building suggested we knock as they should be open (we arrived 30 minutes after posted opening time). We were greeted by an annoyed gentleman that asked if we had a reservation and told us to come back half an hour later. We went to Mitey Nice a couple blocks down and enjoyed a 5 star and cheerful dinner there instead.  Heard this place was a hidden gem. But maybe there's a reason it stays hidden.",

I stumbled across Le Petit Paris on the internet and loved the old school charm it seemed to exude. I was excited and booked a reservation on open table.  We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation, so we were seated in the bar and given cocktails while we waited for our table. We were shown to our linen covered table in a few short minutes. Bread with sweet butter pats and waters were on the table when we were seated. The menu is full of traditional French dishes, and from the looks of the owner/host/chef, I would gamble that everything is done in the traditional French manner from scratch.  We started with escargots. They were tender and flavorful in a garlicy parsley butter topped with puff pastry. I had the featured lamb chops for my dinner. The herb encrusted lamb was perfectly cooked to medium rare and was accompanied by steamed fresh vegetables, roasted russet potatoes and the most delicious port wine reduction. Heaven on a plate! My dinner partner opted for the filet au poivre. The dish was accompanied with the same veg and potatoes as the lamb and was topped with a cognac peppercorn sauce with both black and red peppercorns. The filet itself was perfectly cooked to medium rare and was extremely tender and succulent. The accompanying sauce was super savory and had just the right amount of heat from the peppercorns. This was a really great dish.  For dessert, we decided to share the apple tart. When we ordered it, we were told it would be about 15-20 minutes for the tart. Why? Because they make it from scratch per order. How great is that? The tart was fresh, hot and delicious with rich buttery flavor with a hint of cinnamon to compliment the freshly sliced apples. A great ending to a great dining experience.  The prices are very reasonable. The cocktails are large. The pace is leisurely. The atmosphere is up-scale. The quality and preparation of the food is outstanding.  The owner/host was charming to us and we enjoyed the banter we had back and forth with him. This was everything I could have hoped for in a traditional French restaurant. I can\u2019t wait for our next trip to Chicago so we can visit again. I would highly recommend Le Petit Paris.",

Theres\u2019s some really good French contemporary music out there. - worst of all, our waiter was actually the owner himself, who was quite disdainful from the moment we said we would not order wine. We were on the verge of leaving before getting our food, but decided to look on the bright side and enjoy our meal after all. As said initially, the food itself was really good, but if you are not a regular, you will be treated like s***. Will never return.",

He made good conversation with our kids and invited them to the bar to help him make kiddie cocktails. The kids were besides themselves! Considering how busy it gets on a Saturday night, the courses came at a perfect pace. From the bread and the appetizers (we picked the escargots, frog legs, pate, onion soup) to the entrees (file mignon au poivre, beef liver, beef tartare) and deserts (creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate mouse) everything was made to perfection. The cooking is closer to French country in my opinion, classics made as if the chef cooks for himself. We'll definitely be back!",

It is a quaint restaurant with a personalized level of service from the owner that is unparalleled.  The menu is well balanced and affordably priced. Everything, starters to dessert is handmade and delicious.  Wine prices are fair and liquor selection is impressive. There were six of us and we almost had an entire tour of the menu. I don't remember the last time I heard \"this is so delicious\" so many times within a 3 hour stretch.  I not only would recommend, I insist that you go.  I will be back.  Maybe tonite! If not, will return to CHI next month and already thinking about what to order.",

We were seated at the minibar and the jukebox ate a dollar and didn't even play the songs we requested.  That's alright, we get to our table. My friend has a severe peanut and shell-fish allergy which gets triggered with even cross-contamination and she mentions this to the waitress. They send her her cheese plate and they weren't sure if the bread had traces of nuts and so we had to cancel it. The chef, an elderly man of French origin I assume come out and asked her what the problem is. She explained the allergy (which the waitress said she would translate to the chef but evidently didn't) who then makes a snarky comment saying \"Sure sure now you all have the allergy, I hope you're not allergic to the food\" while walking away from us and slamming the cheese plate on another table.  We decided that we didn't feel safe eating here so we told the waitress to cancel our orders and that we were going to head out. Get to the door, it's locked. Not only is that a fire hazard but extremely rude, he stops us at the front and asks us to pay for the food that hadn't even been prepped after a 45 minute initial wait and 45 mins of waiting for food and the incident I mentioned earlier. We explained to him why we wouldn't be doing that and that his treatment was extremely rude but he continued to deny that. Eventually he let us leave and we ended up going to an Italian restaurant with much better service and perhaps just as good food.  If you look at other reviews, both 1 and 5 star you'll see that weather or not the food is good, the owner/chef is extremely rude and assumptive.",

Decent was an apple tart that like flavor but not delectable. I could have and have had better meals.  Also, the website is sad and not kept up to date with accurate content. The menu online is different than what's in the menu when you get there. In this day in age, websites are the first introduction to one's business. The owner might want to re-evaluate.  Interesting experience probably but won't return ever. Although, tipped very well, I was not impressed with the full experience and can have a better experience for what paid.",

He pointed to a different man (lately found out that he is the owner). He came toward us, no greeting, so I repeated that we have the reservation. His answer was, \"and you have a reservation without a name?\" (bad joke or rudeness?) After telling him the name of reservation, he took us to a table for two. The upholstered bench was flat, empty of the upholstered filling, I was sitting lower than my wife who was sitting on a chair. A waiter with two glasses of water and the menu came quite fast. I was surprised, that in a French restaurant was no bigger selection of wine, only 3 white and 3 red wines at $7 price. Maybe, they just forgot to give us wine menu.The waiter came back to take our order, he was very nice, polite and helpful. In the middle of our conversation with the waiter, the owner came and announced that the waiter is new there and he will take our order. I remarked, that the waiter is doing very well and we are OK. The owner, obviously upset without a word turned around and left. We saw later that the owner was very unpleasant to our waiter. The waiting for our food, even there were not too many guests was very long. The escargot were fantastic, my rack of lamb were very taste, but cold. My wife filet mignon was OK. Wine was just so-so. Within almost 1.5 hours there, we had no time to peruse dessert menu. Even waiting for the check was too long. The owner stopped paying attention to us, and there was nobody to thank us for coming and say good by!? They will not see us there anymore. I hope that our waiter will keep his job.",

He was perplexed about some customer who was extremely upset that he ran out of an item.  He gets produce daily, and orders quantities of meat and fish so that they are fresh when cooked.  I had a wonderful rack of lamb, and it was the last one he had that night.  Then I log into Google and read the last reviewer who was upset about running out of an item.  Put two and two together and you get .....  I have met a lot of restaurant owners who find themselves in a difficult position at this point this winter.  Between the snow, the cold and the economy, business is so slow, I mean really, really slow, that it is a struggle to maintain quality of the food and quality of the service that is easy to maintain when you have a healthy flow of customers.  Every successful restaurant is a successful collaboration of its customers and the establishment, it owners and staff.  When the weather and the economy warms up, I think all of the small business owners will be a lot less crabby.  In the meantime, Le Petit Paris is a great place for Valentine's Day weekend and on any other day because the food is fresh and reservations are plentiful.  Relax and enjoy yourself!",

It's a place where you would least expect to bring a dinner date but it will definitely leave you with a memorable experience.  The atmosphere is enchanting to say the least. It's a small little place, about 10 tables on the first floor and a few more on the smaller second floor. It's dimly lit with orange lights and when you are greeted at the door by the french owner, you immediately feel like you're in Paris. He has such flair and flamboyance, which makes you feel at ease and relaxed. But this is only the start.  As your evening goes on, the place grows on you and when the food comes, oh my! I had the Escargots Bourguignon and Boeuf Bourguignon. Both were simply astounding. The escargots were done in a puff pastry, which was light, airy and fluffy. The escargots themselves were perfectly cooked, tender and juicy with each mouthful. The mint sauce that it was in complemented the dish wonderfully. A great appetizer to start my meal.  After that, the beef was served. At first glance, it did look a tad small, but what it lack in quantity, it more than made up in quality. The beef was so tender that I did not need a knife to cut it. Just a light touch with my fork, and the beef was falling all over the place. Needless to say when it entered my mouth, no chewing was necessary. It simply melted away, providing my tastebuds with delightful flavor and texture. I could go on and on to describe the beef but it wouldn't do it justice. All I can really say is for you to give it a try for yourself and experience it.  For the quality of food and atmosphere it provides, the prices are reasonable. If you're looking for a quiet place, a romantic dinner over masterfully cooked french food, this is the place to be at.",
