Once seated, the show began... literally, with appetizers and flames coming from the hot plate grill. Aaron, our personal chef, thrilled the table with tricks, bubbling lava volcanos made out of onions and ended with lobster amd filet mignon on a bed of fried rice. We shared our chef with another family, the  Doyle's from Kentucky and they had a dilemma, because they were a family of five and a newborn infant made that a party of six, they weren't expecting that the infant would count as 6, which is not allowed because of Covid. So the staff worked to put three of them on one corner of the huge tables and three at the other side of tables so they were still able to eat together separated by Two Chefs and we had the pleasure of watching little Benjamin's face light up and go a little crazy as the Flames flared in between each course, great Dinner & a Show from Aaron. Great way to spend a Valentine's dinner! We Will definitely go back again.",

They will validate for parking as well. The food is phenomenal - never a bad meal. Order the filet, lobster, or shrimp and get a side of salad dressing to dip the seafood in. The restaurant itself is nice because the sliding doors open up and create a nice indoor/outdoor dining feel with good airflow. I don't know why this place isn't packed solid every time I go there. The managers are really on top of it and want to make sure you have the best \"experience\" rather than just a dinner out. I eat here often and every time the chefs are so good that I don't even have a favorite because they're all amazing. Five stars all around to managers Kevin, Jamie, and Tatianna and last night we had superstar chef Aaron and his sidekick Hong take care of us - water was never empty, plates were never clear of food, and we had an amazing time with almost the whole place to ourselves.",

He had to ask more than once for a hot towel(shoes ruined). The manager(I think his name was Steve, but I discarded the card)did absolutely nothing but give a half apology, a pen, and his business card. On top of that, our order was messed up.

Our server was Brad and our chef was Laurance. We shared the table with a few other people since there were only two of us this unable to fill an entire table.  Brad was very attentive to everyone on the table. He always came around and asked if we wanted another drink whenever one of us finished the last sip of the drink. Sometimes the guest at the table would ask for another one and when the guest said no more drinks, Brad would immediate say he would bring some water without the guest asking. Laurance was also very good as a chef. He kept everybody at the table entertained throughout the entire dinning experience.  Overall I think this was a good experience, especially if you have never experienced teppanyaki before.",

The chefs baked at the same time as the other two sets of customers, and it came out the most from the other two pairs. Moreover, the timing at which medium rare and medium are also given is almost the same. When we try to eat, both are close to Well-dan. If you pay for this price, you can eat more delicious things in Japan. Performance is the main, do not you think about baking time? Rice and miso soup come out even though I still drink alcohol. Even though the dessert is not over, it comes out. I do not think that this is a good service. I will never go.

Overall, it was a great experience seeing as how this location had electrical Teppanyaki grills and apparently it\u2019s the only Location on Oahu that uses this new system. It shows that the company is making strives to bring eco friendly through their efforts in eliminating the use of propane or gas. And shows that the company cares about these things.",

AMAZING!! So as soon as we sat down our drink orders got taken and then someone from management came to welcome us and gave us each a reusable back and some side orders of fried rice, also to wish me a happy birthday. i couldn't believe how personable they were and how much they seemed to care about their customers. then our cook came and he was so good. he was friendly and nice. He had many tricks and treats in his show and the food....OMG i cant even put into words how amazing it was. i ordered the steak and shrimp and my wife ordered the seafood combo and there were a few other ordered of shell fish and we had one person in our party allergic to shell fish and our cook totally accommodated her and made sure to cook her food alone and that made her feel so safe eating there. we never had to wonder where our server was or if we were going to get more drinks, always was there to ask if we needed more refills and anything else. the food was so good and the show amazing that by the time it was time for dessert we realized it was 2 hours later and it didn't even feel like it, we were having so much fun! they then brought out ice cream for everyone and a very cute plate with a cake one it for me and had everyone sing for me....totally funny and embarrassing lol. then they cut it up for the whole party, so yummy too....we got some boxes to take left overs and then before we even got a chance to leave the manager was back again to make sure we had a good time and everything was okay and good. i will totally be back again and be telling everyone about how good of service i had here!",

I really love salmon but regardless of how you order it, they always seem to want to serve it medium rare (mushy in other words).  I asked for mine \"flaky\" but not over cooked and was delighted the chef managed to do it exactly the way I like it.  I can't wait to go back!",
