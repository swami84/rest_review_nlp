The $ 20 goblin bitrio bowl (beef + chicken + shrimp) menu is really full and the amount of rice is so generous that it is full ..  All three menus I ordered had a salad. The combination of rice + meat + vegetables + nachos is perfect !! (I don't know exactly, but the menus are Hawaiian + Korean based on Mexican style)  In addition, the boss and the mother of the boss run together. The boss is really really so kind that I feel Korean's affection here !! There is a park in front of the food truck, so it's great to eat and go!
