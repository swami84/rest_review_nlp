Their service was great and the ambiance was perfect. We were served quickly and the staff was attentive and brought candles to the table once the sun set. They offer live music on the weekends as well. We had the stuffed mushrooms which came on a bed of onion rings. The flavor and consistency was great. I had the Coconut Shrimp Salad which offered a ton of variety of texture and flavor. My boyfriend had the White Fish which was atop of a medley of vegetables including mushrooms, tomatoes and sliced asparagus. We loved everything about this place and will be back again. Austin and the staff treated us well!",

The custom omlette bar is amazing because you can pick out anything you want and the will make it to your liking. They will make your Belgian Waffles fresh with many selections of toppings. They have a large greenhouse area, or outdoor seating next to the creek, some times you can see the ducks on the creek.  They have a beautiful patio seating area as well. In my opinion they have the best Sunday Brunch in the area, and the best value for the money! They also have a fantastic dessert bar, with cheese cake, and more desserts than I have ever seen in my life. This is the nicest place I have ever been to in this entire area!!!",

We go to Silver Creek when we visit family, we will just have to pack a meal for our little one.  As for my food, it was fine but nothing special. I had a burger and chips. However the chocolate cake my brother-in-law ordered was delicious!  In short, entrees are ok, dessert, wait staff, and atmosphere are great!",

Traditional omelet and Belgian waffle stations still feature pros who cook to your taste, but the main buffet is now in the larger dining space instead of the small bar area. Today: salmon, stuffed baked chicken, sliced prime rib, whole ham, with wonderful creative sides - each a culinary treat. When you have a pastry chef the dessert selection looks like what we found today. My favorite was the Tropical Trifle. Marcia was our personal attendant and her service was impeccable and personable.

Omelette made to order, great fresh salad and so many things to add. Comfort food made at a VERY high level of craft! The desserts were positively 5 star!  Atmosphere was romantic and quaint all the at the same time! It was very much a surprise how much I enjoyed this place! The service, however, can not be overstated! Megan was an amazing server, walking that always hard to judge line of being attentive and leaving us alone! And she did so almost effortlessly and with such grace!  The staff, while most look like models, are all way above a standard staff!!! Dressed like a restaraunt of a much higher standing, made the place seem much more posh and very inviting! Take a date here...first date or anniversary...you will NOT be disappointed!  Give this place a chance! You will NOT regret it. A certain hidden gem!!",

Low enough to light meals with sufficient light for photos but not too low to annoy guests. A very good choice these lights. The food was good. I had a \"beef tenderloin\" in 3 services.

The brunch is all you can eat buffet style, but with an upscale and cozy/quaint feeling. In respect to the front doors, when you walk in the lunch foods are on the left, salad bar and desserts are in the center, and breakfast foods are on the right. Everything is made well and with fresh ingredients. There's an omelet bar on the breakfast side. Servers are attentive to drink refills but not intrusive. You will want to get there 10-15 minutes before they're scheduled to open, or expect a longer wait if you arrive much later than that because although I wouldn't say seating is scarce, they tend to fill up fairly quick in the morning. Be prepared to spend $$, not $. Arguably the best restaurant I've been to in Illinois.",

Silvercreek is likely the best that Champaign has to offer, but it still falls short of a 4 or 5 star dining experience in Chicago. As soon as you step into the restaurant, the all brick wall and wood ceiling interior adds a bit of class to your meal. We went in the summer time, but I can imagine how rustic it would feel in the winter with the large fireplaces that are along the adjacent wall. The server was quick to take our orders and get the kids meals out first with the appetizer. We went with the appetizer sampler which had the shrimp cocktail served with blue cheese mousse with cocktail sauce (FYI they serve it in such a weird shot glass that I thought it was an oyster in cocktail sauce....), calamari fried exceptionally well, marinated olives with a sweet zest, and duck prosciutto wrapped dates. It was nice trying a bunch of apps on plate. My duck entree is where it losses some stars as only 3/4 of this was cooked well, the other 1/4 was too well done on the chewy side. The cauliflower and parsnip puree along with the shiitake mushroom roasted cauliflower complemented the dish well especially the freshness of the vegetables. I am also very concern why there was a dark blue discoloration in the duck breast as noted in my picture. The redeeming quality is the extensive options on the menu and some farm to table elements.  Pros: refined menu that utilizes many components to the dish, special dinner menu, Sunday brunch  Cons: What is up with the blue discoloration in the duck breast and 1/4 of it was way over done  Hidden deals: 1. Sunday brunch buffet- I need to come back and give this a try 2. Pre-fixe menu- not advertised on the website 3 course meal for 29.99 3. Global Wednesday- unique foods from around the world 4. Live music Friday night",

For Instance, Opera Cake, was a thick double layered hazelnut sponge with buttercream between the two layers and on top. Opera Cake is actually, SEVEN thin layers of Almond sponge (Joconde) soaked in coffee syrup, with a coffee or Grand Marnier buttercream between the layers and then a dark chocolate mirror glaze on top with OPERA written on that in a lighter chocolate to stand out. It is sometimes called Clichy Cake after Louis Clichy who did something similar at the 1903 Exposition Culinaire in Paris. So please be aware you may not get what you are actually expecting. Also the menu changes seasonally, which can be a good thing, but if you are expecting something you recently had that you liked it might have changed. Ilike the atmosphere in Silvercreek, but it just lacks something, perhaps the friendliness of High Class Restaurants I am Used To. But this is just my opinion, go yourself and try it please.",

With the atmosphere set, we were off to having one of the most enjoyable meals we've had in the area.  The service was excellent - not too intrusive, and we never lacked for beverages (I believe our server was Jennifer).  Our questions about the menu were answered quickly and accurately.  The food was really top notch.  We started with the truffle fries, my husband had the 6 oz fillet (which was cooked perfectly rare) and I had the lobster mac and cheese which was seriously tasty.  For dessert I had the chocolate cake and my husband had the berries and cream.  From start to finish, this place was worth every penny!",

        "caption": "My husband and I were thrilled to book our wedding reception at Silvercreek this past summer.  Trisha Henry, Silvercreek\u2019s event coordinator, made the entire details/menu/timeline stress-free for us during the planning process.  Thank you, Trisha!  Silvercreek\u2019s reputation for great food was our number one reason for selecting the restaurant for our reception site.  Besides the fantastic food, we loved the uniqueness and layout of Silvercreek which has a great deal more beauty and character than you would get from the usual wedding banquet center. We rented the entire space for our August reception, having a guest count of 150. For anyone reading this who hasn\u2019t been to Silvercreek, this includes the main dining area, an attached (heated and air-conditioned) greenhouse, and an outside patio with chairs and tables.  During the social hour, appetizers and drinks were hosted in the greenhouse and we were lucky to have perfect weather which allowed our guests to flow out onto the adjoining spacious patio.  Trees and large umbrellas gave shade to the tables and by 5pm most of the patio was fully shaded, as it is situated on the east side of the building.  Dinner service was upstairs in the main dining room and bar area, which turned out to be perfectly-sized for a buffet-style service with our guest count.  After dessert and coffee, everyone retreated down to the Greenhouse and patio again for a few more drinks and a lot of dancing.  Our family and friends could not have been more pleased with how wonderful Silvercreek service staff were attentive and genuinely caring for their needs.  Grace and Heather managed the event and did a superb job of keeping the evening running smoothly, including expedient bar service to our guests.  Most comments we continue to hear from our guests are compliments regarding the culinary talent from the chef and kitchen staff at Silvercreek.  Our families and guests had a wonderful experience and we wish to thank Silvercreek staff for an exceptional evening.",
