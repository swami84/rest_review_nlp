Update: 1-29-21 Last night we went online to place an order for Chinese Dinner's. We had no paper menus but when you search on Google & Yelp you can see the menus. I tried for the first time in their Chef's Special. Their Rice Noodles Taiwan Style it came in a large size. And it had Glass Noodles thinner than spaghetti pasta, mixed with shredded chicken, bean sprouts, peapods, carrots, onions they were shredded also in strips. My sister said she was able to watch them cook my meal . I also asked for 2 Egg Rolls so she got 1 package. And I asked for almond cookies which are not on the menu. But you can buy them separately. They come in a pack of 4. My sister got her usual in a Dinner Special which is #18. General Tao's Chicken but it comes with Chicken Fried Rice, 1 egg roll and a drink a bottle of water or a soda for $8.35 a little more with your meal. She went out to pickup our take out. And gave a tip in person. I took pictures but I will order this again, I have always see glass noodles in the grocery stores wondering what they taste like. Now I know. They gave us 2 large containers and I have enough for 2 more days. My sister gets this all the time and she was craving Chinese too!   She said everyone she saw at least 7 other people placing there orders in person and waiting to pick up like her. I like to try something different on the menu.",

We were missing a side of white rice (not worth calling to get) and the dumplings were very cold and soggy.  My friend also order the sweet and sour trio where he had to open each piece up to see if there is any meat in it. We arent even half way done and both agreed to never order again unfortunately. I'm hope dining in is a better option.  Spent $30 for lunch for two and we tossed out half the food not including the missing side. Keeping at two stars since the beef and broccoli was good. But not worth the $30 on it's own.",

I try not to be overly critical, but it was honestly disgusting, the worst food I've had at a restaurant, and I couldn't eat it (I'm not a picky person). It was a large serving of noodles, but it only had a couple slices of green pepper, and what little meat was in it was dry.",
