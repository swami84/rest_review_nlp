The soup came separated where the fresh ingredients were in there own container and the broth was in its own to prevent things from getting soggy and I really appreciated that. Once mixed together the soup was delicious.  The fajitas were great. But I was bummed they only provide 2 flour tortillas. IMO this dish should come with 4 as you could easily make 4 normal size fajitas with a couple strips of steak inside.  The sides for the fajitas came separate and were fresh. Rice tasted fantastic. The beans, IMO, weren't great flavor wise but overall okay to throw onto the fajita.  I'm definitely going to order take out from here again. Well worth a shot.  EDIT: Dined in and it was simply fantastic. The food is so damn authentic and taste wonderful. Cannot recommend this place enough!!!",

We were allowed to try the homemade vanilla coconut flan with dulce de leche, too, which was incredible. We will definitely be going back because the menu has so much more we want to try. Everyone should support this business. But be warned, the food is cooked fresh, so you have to wait a bit for it. Regardless, service was excellent.",
