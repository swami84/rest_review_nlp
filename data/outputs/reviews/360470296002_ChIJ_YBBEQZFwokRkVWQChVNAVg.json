I recently moved and found them on grubhub hub and ordered a couple of times and no issues. Today however I placed an order on grubhub, the restaurant confirmed the order and the wait began. The food was scheduled to be delivered at 840. I called the restaurant at 845 just to find out they havent even started making the order. I called grubhub and they got in contact with the restaurant only to tell me the restaurant cancelled the order. So I waited an hour and a half for them thinking the order is in progress when in fact they had no intention of delivering me the food. Shows how they treat loyal customers. Guess k have to find a sushi spot that will actually deliver food.",

Every time we order, we are satisfied with the quality and freshness. Their pricing is very reasonable, especially considering the large portion sizes of their entrees.  The fish in their sushi is always fresh, and the rice is never the hard texture you can get from sushi rice sometimes. A huge plus for me is their salmon sashimi. The portions are much heartier and well-portioned than other restaurants we've ordered from (sometimes at double the price). Their sashimi is always a great texture - that buttery and smooth texture you want in fresh sashimi.  We recommend Ika to our friends & family in the area all the time. Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a consistent place to order from!",

We hit up Ika Sushi through Google's Assistant's Reserve a Table option. Upon confirmed, we showed up and noticed that the restaurant was EMPTY. There was NOT A SINGLE table of customers. I quickly realized that this was because everyone does delivery/take out here. They had a table to the side for the delivery person to pick up for the next delivery.  After we all decided what we wanted, we placed our order and did not have to wait very long for our food to arrive. As a party of 10, we ordered udon, don bowls (pork katsu and eel), sashimi, sushi rolls, dinner bento and pretty much half of their appetizers menu.  EVERYTHING was delicious! But a specific comment on their sashimi-- I love it! It's ACTUAL pieces of sashimi, like sashimi sized sashimi, not the thin and short pieces like you get at other locations. I would definitely come back, even if I am the only customer eating there.  And those comments about the staff being rude are false. English is not their first language, so please understand that their vocabulary is kind of limited. If you ordered online, then there may have been an issue with the system. I had a 10/10 experience as a in-store customer.",

I thought it goes to driver for delivery, this was first time i used this app. Driver arrived and started yelling at me, that 2$ tip i gave him was not enough. I thought 4$ total for order should be enough, because other 2$ were charged in the order. He did not explain that this charge does not go toward drivers, he was screaming.... and after this attitude i felt like i don't want to give him even this 2$, because this is not professional. If I did something wrong, he could just explain. I called restaurant to ask them why driver allowed himself to speak like that with me. Lady was rude too and than she explained me that this charge doesn't go towards driver pay and was blaming me. I am not ordering anything from them. Even if i did something wrong, driver could tell me, that. No need to scream, after that nobody will give you tips.",

The first time I was there, I got a tuna roll, a salmon skin roll, a couple pieces of Uni (sea urchin), Tobiko (Flying fish roe) and Ikura (Salmon roe). The tuna was blood red with a good clean taste as a good tuna should be. The Ikura and Tobiko were beautifully fresh too, but the Uni...wow! The Uni was creamy and briny but it didn't have that nasty iodine-y taste that some Uni has. It made me wish that I had ordered more! The next time I went back, I opted for a tuna hand roll that was very generous with the tuna and as fresh as the tuna I had gotten there two days before. The Uni was also perfect, it wasn't a fluke, speaking of which, that was good too! Even though the 30% off offer is now a thing of the past, I plan on being a regular here because the quality of the sushi is definitely a cut above everyone else in the neighborhood. PS, the staff is super nice too.",

Unlike other sushi which will offer unfresh or  cheap uni.  Since we're loyal customers here, they always offer new complementary appetizer and ask for our opinion as they want to add on the menu.  Other than the quality of food, service is always great in here.  They are friendly and talkative. May and Jack are the boss and they always there.  If I am craving for sushi which happened every single week, I will come here.  Also, I would totally recommend this place to my friends or unknown.",
