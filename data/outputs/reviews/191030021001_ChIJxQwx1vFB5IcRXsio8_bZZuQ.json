I waited 15 minutes for the server to bring me some and it still did not arrive.  As I was leaving, the manager gave no apology and simply said it was not his fault.  Of course it was his fault.  The buffet had barely any food, there was not tea and management made no apology.  If you want hot, delicious Indian food and friendly customer service, DO NOT GO TO MASALA of Iowa City.",

The general ambience of the restaurant is kinda gloomy. Limited lighting and damp looking walls made the place look dull. However I had high hopes from the food. I started with tomato soup and had my first sip when I realized that there's something different about it. When I asked the waiter what are those white pieces floating around, he said it was chicken soup labeled as tomato soup!!! He changed the label, gave a idiotic smile and turned around and left. No apologies nothing!! That was highly unprofessional and rude. However, now that the damage was done, and I was very hungry, I thought to eat the main course. The palak paneer (spinach+cottage cheese) had no trace of the cheese. The vegetable korma was highly disappointing made of boiled vegetables with indian spices and whipped cream. The chole (chickpea dish) was however good. Overall there was more variety than quality. Despite my experiences I give them 2 stars because the aamras (mango juice) and kheer (rice pudding) were really well prepared.",

For that I give them three stars, but I frequently run into issues that seem to stem from poor management. I've been asked to switch tables mid-meal to accommodate another group; I've tried using an online certificate but was then told I could not use it if dining with another patron (which does not make sense, nor is that stated anywhere in the fine print); I've ordered take-out several times and gotten home to find that an item was missing (either rice or naan bread each time). This is my favorite place to go for a buffet lunch, but I've frequently had bad experiences ordering off their regular menu outside of lunch hours.",

They really do a great job bringing Indian flavor to Iowa, and it is difficult to find fresh ingredients to do that with, especially in winter. I ordered the Rogan Josh, which is basically a curry, and it was pretty good. It had the right level of spice. One thing I enjoyed was the proportion of meat in the curry. The meat in a curry is meant to just be one part of the whole curry, not the predominant thing. These guys did it correctly, and in a short frame of time. I will be visiting again.  A note to other reviewers: You can't expect homemade Indian cooking from a restaurant unless you are paying 50$ a plate. This is a place to experience the flavors in a pinch, or a place to bring a date/acquaintance for lunch. If you want laalmaas that some lady has slaved for 12 hours to make, go to India. Remember that they have to accommodate a broad range of palates, and they are doing just fine without your cheeky reviews.",

We finished our food and I find out that I was charged $.50 for not completely finishing the food on my plate. I know this because the buffet was $9.99. My friends bill was $10.59 w/tax but mine was $11.12. I asked the old Indian gentleman about it and he told it it was a fee they charge for unfinished food. It was a single samosa that I had on my plate. He then showed me the menu for the cost of the samosa and told me I need to respect the food and not waste it.  Basically, I was full, but had to FORCE myself to finish that single item of food so that I would not be charged that fee. I will NEVER be returning nor will I recommend to anyone. I also have the voided receipt as proof.",
