Then you select your choice of 5 different curries:  Tikka Marsala, Vindaloo, Korma, Saag, and Kadai.   (descriptions are in my photos of the menu).  Then it's your choice of a dish, either a rice bowl or feast.  My selections were a Chicken Tikka Bowl with saag curry  To drink I had a Mango Lassi that was delicious, I just wish there would've been more of it.  Tikka and Curry is a little hard to find, but well worth the trip for a delicious healthy meal.",

It doesn\u2019t get too crowded at lunch and this is the perfect place for someone who is new to I Sian cuisine to try it out. Arguably, the tikka massala is one of the popular dishes.
