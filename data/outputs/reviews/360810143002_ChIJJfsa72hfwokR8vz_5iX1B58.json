Heads up they close from 4pm-5pm to get ready for the dinner patrons.  We ordered the fuska, saag paneer, chicken tikka mac and cheese, lemon rice and garlic butter naan. I think my only gripe was that we couldn\u2019t try their masala chai. The waitress told us it was only available after 5pm. I\u2019ll have to go back for dinner then haha! Oh and their lemon rice didn\u2019t taste as lemony and seasoned as I thought it would be? As I compared it to the white rice it kind of tasted about the same. I\u2019ve only tried lemon rice one other time and I remembered it being more seasoned and lemony. But it wasn\u2019t a big deal just want to give a heads up to others who want to order it. Perhaps this is just how the restaurant does it. Other than that everything else was superb.  Definitely coming back!!!",

I found both the white rice and lemon rice was kind of hard and tasted old.  There should be a few more spicy options for the people who can handle it, but overall if you have no spice tolerance, this would be an okay place to dine out.",

How do you serve dahi poori without tamarind chutney? Aloo tikki was below average and again lacked sauces and flavor. The gobi manchurian likely saved the night for us. Also, give your customers a heads up that they will be served bottled water and will be charged extra! I don't mind paying, but can you imagine the number of water bottles they are going through a night and those ending up in a landfill? I am absolutely against the plastic bottles!! Anyway, back to the food..not worth all that hype in my opinion..",

The kati chicken roll, gol guppa/pani puri, & gulab jamin were mediocre. You can just about get it at any local Desi restaurant for half the price. Thumbs up to the waitress who recommended to come back and try the chicken tikka Mac and cheese - way after i ordered though. Shoutout to them using a Drake quote because it matters for the culture. Def recommend to check it out if you\u2019re in the area.",

I liked the calamari Chaat somewhat, it was interesting. There's lots of Bollywood posters on the ceiling and paintings of Bollywood actors in the wall.

Since we got there at an early time for dinner (6:30 pm), it was easy to get seated. Notably, they have a 45 min seating policy once food arrives.  Our server came out and asked if we were cool with either soda or water. We decided water and they brought out Poland spring bottles. Notably, the place does not serve alcohol.  We placed or orders and the food came out in about 15 mins. The Chicken Tikka Mac and Cheese was hands down our fave part of the night. We also both really liked our entrees. I love the creamy consistency of the sauces for both the Saag and Korma. Other Indian places have sauces that are pretty runny.  The vibes were chill, the Indian music playing at the place gave it a nice ambiance, and the food was really delicious.  Highly recommend you check this place out when you\u2019re in Astoria.",

I didn't order the fuska but I believe people are confusing the two as pictures of the fuska have a sauce and different filling. The guac dahi puri is NOT the same as the fuska.The chicken tikka biryani was very salty, and had a tad bit too much masala. The only thing I enjoyed was the chicken tikka mac and cheese. I hope that the flavor profiles improve because the idea of such a place is cool (the inside is cozy but pretty!). The prices are also reasonable, at least in my opinion.",

However, the night started off on the wrong foot the minute we stepped in. We had a 7:30PM reservation and despite our entire party being present, the host gave our table away to another walk-in party because he did not accurately verify if the walk-in party had a reservation. They tried to accommodate or save themselves by offering us a table to share with another party, but neither party wanted share a table as everyone wants to eat in their own space. We had to wait another 30 minutes just to be able to sit down. Once seated, the waiter was very nice, accommodating and really knew the menu and what recommendations to make. For appetizers, we ordered the fuska, the chicken tikka Mac n' cheese, chicken burger and lamb chops. The fuska was a standard version of pain puri, which one can get at any Indian establishment. The chicken tikka Mac n' cheese and chicken burger were the only highlights of the evening. The lamb chops were overly salty and not a good balance of flavors. For entrees we ordered the chicken biryani and butter chicken, which was also standard for any Indian restaurant. All in all, it was a standard overly-hyped restaurant with poor customer service and a basic menu.",

We tried the mac and cheese because it is so raved about, but it's the one item we could have ALL done without, it's basically a cheese fondue, I wasn't a fan.

So far I had fuska, chicken tikka Mac and cheese,  chicken biryani, pav bhaji, their chai and mango lassi. Their food did not disappoint me at all. Food was amazing. Their space is small but I love the creativity they put into their walls. The second time I went there, I took my family with me. Even they loved their food. The gully is definitely a great place to try some amazing Indian food. Good customer service as well. I just wish they expand this place in the future Bcz it does get pretty busy and they don\u2019t have much seating arrangement. I\u2019ll definitely be back when I crave some Indian food . \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc",

The person in charged told us to wait for 30 minutes. Basically it was pointless to make reservations a day before for a huge crowd when we all had to wait additional half an hour. We all were standing as the restaurant was packed. Lesson learned not to call to make any reservations in this place. I was there with my toodler who already lost his patience that's why I had to walk outside in the pouring rain with him just so that he is okay then we all can eat dinner later on peacefully. My first impression with this place was extremely terrible due to unprofessional wait time for the large party eho made reservations but thanks to the yummiest food I forgot about the horrible wait. It's a gem of a place in Steinway with fusion of Bangali and Indian... I loved everything that we ordered. I will recommend all the foodie just to stop by once. The person in charge gave a slice of a cake in the end while we were waiting for our take home food.",

If you like that type of thing then  this is a good place. Now let\u2019s talk about the food. If you are looking for authentic Indian or Bangladeshi food this is not the place. Their \u201cfuska\u201d was not that good. Bit bland. They have some nice ideas like the chicken tikka masala Mac and cheese which feels like they took tikka masala and mixed it with krafts Mac and cheese. All the curry was over powering with heave cream/butter. I did like the biryani. I found the portion bit small compared to other Desi spots. Almost all the dish had nice heat(spicy) to it. I defiantly liked that. Overall this place is not bad. It\u2019s a good concept of mixing American food with Indian food. It\u2019s the new trend. The service was very good. I would go back to this place if I\u2019m in the area and crave Indian food.",

I then choked on the same raw red pepper that was on the chicken tikka Kati roll. The chicken tikka mac n\u2019cheese was not good either. I actually got sick after having a quarter bowl of that. It tasted like butter chicken and Mac N\u2019 cheese mixed. In a nutshell it\u2019s not my kind of food honestly, I\u2019m big on food.

There is beautiful street art reminiscent of words, movies and celebrities I grew up seeing on tv. Besides the experience, the food is exceptional. The Dahi Puri, Chicken tikka mac n cheese, lamb burger and chicken tikka Kati roll are literally my favorite dishes. I love everything on the menu and have no complaints. The chai and mango lassi are great drinks for anyone that wants authentic Indian flavors. The service is always on par and everyone is very attentive. Overall, Gully has taken the average home cooked food and elevated it to a dynamite eating experience that's filled with culture and memories. I highly recommend everyone try it out. Thank you to the owners for recognizing the importance of our culture and doing something so innovative for the community.",

He offered us chai, water, or any sort of drink we would like while we waited. Once we were seated, we gave our order and food was great! We were served food in tin cups and tin plates just like back home. Flavor was amazing, I recommend getting the Aloo Tikki and Kadai Chicken. Tanzir recommended his favorites and indeed they were really good. Polite people, great workers, great vibes. Def check it out if you\u2019re in town.  P.S.: Parking is a nightmare.

There are some interesting fusion options but we only tried the Chicken Tikka Mac n Cheese, which is just an over-hyped, overly sweet, otherwise flavorless and spiceless butter chicken with some cheese and a few macaroni noodles mixed in. Our Chicken Kadari had a decent flavor, but was also washed out with a sweet sauce. Plus we found a hair in our dish, which was replaced with a new one and we were given a discount on our bill...but not one person ever apologized to us. I understand that hairs in the food happens sometimes, but the staff seemed almost annoyed that we pointed it out and wanted a new dish.  Overall, Gully slots in somewhere between authentic and fusion cuisine, with some traditional staples and a few Instagram hype-worthy creations. Unfortunately, they do neither particularly well. At least the chai was pretty good.",

Iv been to many restaurants in my life, and i have never been this disappointed.  this restaurant is good for people who do not know what actual  desi food tastes like.  dont go by IG.     do your research. I am never going back and I would not recommend this to my friends or anyone.",
