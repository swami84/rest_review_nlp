When we got there, the person who answered us at the Ring doorbell (because their store is closed for dine in due to COVID) told us 2 minutes. After the two minutes, they told us \"a few more minutes\" then again \"another 5 minutes\" and this isn't the first time they've tried to pull this for the order being delayed. We tried to patiently wait and the last time we rang the bell, no one answered so we knocked on the window instead and a man came out and GOT IN OUR FACES DURING COVID and said \"don't knock and don't come here ever again\" and we definitely WON'T. When he opened the door, it also wreaked of weed which I don't care about but if it hinders you from doing your job, then don't do it.  This isn't the first time this has happened with the long wait and this will certainly be the last because I will not risk my life to go here just to be spat at and disrespected by someone.

After we had ordered our apps and drinks, you would\u2019ve thought she would\u2019ve mentioned before we ordered anything that there was only one fish left for the evening (we sat for dinner at 4pm). The food was severely over priced for the quantity and quality of the dishes. We tried our best to support this black business as fellow Africans, by it was undeniable that our waitress had deliberately over charged us on several items we ordered. When we asked her about the discrepancies (being charged for goat when we ate beef, being charged double for a side that was clearly listed for $6) she aggressively doubled down by stating all items on the menu -including vegetables and rice  were subject to market price increase. None of this is written on the menu and quite frankly I was insulted at the blatant hustle taking place. She further insulted us by throwing several loose dollars at us from her tip jar which only further confused the situation.  We politely gave her back her tip jar money, paid and left.  Don\u2019t hustle people you think are from outa town and don\u2019t know any thing about west African food and what it actually costs to make it.  What a disappointment.  This is why our communities are not economically where they should be every one trying to get over on each other.",

I can\u2019t explain the poor reviews other than our fellow Africans are extremely critical of each other when things are bad but rarely compliment when things are good...The reason my rating is a solid 5 stars!

Her response was \u201cthe food will come out when it comes out\u201d. Absolutely not. I do not pay money at a restaurant to be treated with such disrespect. The waitress never came to our table to check on us or to ask if we needed anything after waiting over an hour. My friends and I left the restaurant with no food after waiting an hour and a half. If this restaurant wants to stay in business, they need to hire people who can communicate efficiently and speak to customers with some sense. I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again.

No good.  - Bartender showed no genuine customer service. was barley given a shot of appioo drink after waiting and watching getting served before other customers that came in restaurant after me. I asked did the amount given of appioo change and was told no. Very weird that when a man came in after me and ordered appioo drink the bartender gave them exactly what is usually poured to all customers.  Bad experience. I hope things can get better and everyone gets served equally.!!",

He told me of a special occasion that was going on that Saturday; that the place would be open to the public at 2PM, but that he was going to have me sit down and let me order nevertheless - which he kindly did. He came with the menu and explained some of the dishes to me. He was very friendly and personable. Across the bar, where I was sitting, was his wife. After I placed my order with one of his children there helping them, his wife came around and nicely chatted with me in a warm yet friendly manner as did her husband. She made sure my order was correctly placed after she explained the difference between some of their good beers.  Now, I ordered \"Wings\" to start, which come with the \"Appioo Sauce\" on the side. Boy, is that sauce good! Well, you go there and try it yourself - fantastic flavor. My main course was the \"Spinach Stew,\" but I asked to modify it and have it with \"Fufu\" instead of rice: they accommodated this with ease. I feasted for about 20 minutes. Their \"Fufu\" melted in my mouth. I remember feeling full but could not stop eating. That's how good the food (and my experience at the Appioo) was.  I commend the place (the owners, the service and the food) to you very highly!  Nicolas J. Nesta.",

I knew the service was not optimal but the food  and  ambiance were great; not stuffy and great African music. In addition, I decided if I\u2019m spending money I might as well support a local African business.  Man!!!! Let me first start with the good; the food, music and ambiance were great. The service was a complete disaster. First, when we got there the tables were not ready despite the fact that I gave them an hour heads up. The waiter failed to order drinks for my guest. I had to \u201cencourage\u201d them to make haste on the order. In addition to the initial drinks debacle, the waiter got the drinks orders wrong for many of my guest. Second debacle, I ordered appetizers for my guest which were great but there was no one to clear the food from the table so my guest and I were sitting with plates of bones and things.  Back to the drinks. After 2 hours of conversation, laughter and a somewhat good time, the waiter proceeds to go around the table to ask my guest about their drink order; \u201cExcuse me, I can\u2019t remember your drink order? what is your name and what did you order to drink?\u201d  Back to the food. The menu was never presented to my guest. I had to retrieve it, myself. Half of my guest ordered food from the menu which never came. In addition the ones that came were incomplete. For example, one of my guest ordered snapper which comes grilled or fried with jollof. My guest was served one dry fried fish with nothing else.  To top in off, when I question the owner about my bill and indicated this was not what we agreed to, he had the audacity to tell me he was doing me a favor. Now, on average this place does only 8 people at one time and I had about 24 guests. How I did him a favor is beyond me. Long story short I show him the communication where we agreed on a certain price and he shamefully complied.  The owner really did himself a disservice because he lost so much money by not having an adequate and efficient staff. It\u2019s really unfortunate because the spot is really nice.",

My fiance is Ghanaian and had been craving kenkey and bitters since he arrived in the US so I thought we'd try this place. We got there a little after 6pm and sat at the bar. I ordered the kelewele to start....which came out slightly burnt and the plaintains werent very sweet but they somewhat tasted like the real thing so we obliged. I then asked about the happy hour menu. The bartender told us that all the drinks were $5. So my fiance ordered the bitters (2) and I ordered the rum punch and the black margarita. I watched the owner make the black margarita with Jack Daniels instead of Makers Mark as described on the menu and quickly asked him about it. He gave us some BS answer about Jack tasting better than Makers but any real drinker knows that's not true...we also know the price difference between the two so seemed like he was just being cheap... not wanting to argue we obliged once again. When the food came out...we were disapointed once again. The kenkey came out with 3 little pieces of fish instead of a whole fish and only one kenkey ball for $18. complete rip off. I ordered the spinach and fish, which was pretty good, but the jollof rice had to have been the plainest jollof rice Ive ever tasted... they probably shouldnt even call it that. The worst part was when the bill came and the owner didnt want to honor the happy hour prices that his waitress told us about. He pushed his waitress on us to discuss the matter while he sat across the bar and watched. He then has his waitress show us some happy hour list that we had never seen and the waitress said she had never seen.  At the end he only honored the happy hour for 2 of the 4 drinks despite HIS employees mistake. I would love to support black/african businesses but until they start to understand that a good reputation is better than money they will never see their full potential.... I will never step foot in or support this business again. Very disappointed.",

We waited over an hour for our food just to receive it cold with dry meat. The waitress had a nasty attitude the entire night. The plantains were unevenly cooked and a soggy mess and the jollof was definitely not Ghanaian jollof. The prices they charged for such poor quality food is outrageous. Overall I'd rate it 0/5 but that's not an option so 1/5 will do. Just don't go there. It's a waste of money for poor service and nasty food.",

This may be because half of the tables in the place were all seated at the same time. The waitress was nice and service was good but the kitchen was slow. I enjoyed the wine I ordered. The palmnut soup wasn't as flavorful as what I'm used to. I asked for some shitto (pepper sauce) to spice it up but the shitto wasn't at all spicy. I wasn't very impressed but I would try this place again.",

Bartender was cool but won't be going back. Summahs is better, at least the cooks there understand what extra Means and don't bullshit you.
