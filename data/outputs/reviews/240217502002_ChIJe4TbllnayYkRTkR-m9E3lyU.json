Especially when it comes to Peruvian dishes such as lomo saltado, you expect a large portion but it's just not. The same is the case for the margaritas which are fantastic. However at $12 a margarita you would expect one of adequate size. They were a bit small in my opinion for the price. Because of this can't give a five stars.",

Our server told us we could have ground beef for our daughter's taco, brought out steak and then told us we couldn't have ground beef.  The majority of the night our waters we're empty.  My wife ordered a drink that took 15 or more minutes to come out.  We had to ask for a refill of salsa three times.  Asked for two boxes, was given one.  After asking for the check once again a long wait, our server disappeared before I can hand him the card.  So we went up front to pay after waiting a while again.  I could understand more if the place was busy, but the two rooms were practically empty the whole night.  A simple dinner took over 90 minutes  Very disappointed.",

We made a reservation weeks before, got there and were told that the hostess didn't show up.  So we waited 35 minutes and finally just took it upon ourselves to find a table.  The line was out the door at  this point.  We got our drinks 30 minutes after seating ourselves and our food order was taken 20 minutes after that.  Food came out 45 minutes later and everything was cold.  If a restaurant can't handle a party of 14 or the crowds during ice festival, don't take the reservation.  Our group was from out of town and we were hosting, this was embarrassing.  Will never go here again, we never even got an apology.",

My carne asada (sp?)steak was cut into 2 pieces the smaller piece was succulent and lucious and the larger piece was grizzly and hard, what's that about? The side orders were very small like maybe 1-2 table spoons with slot of beans. I wasn't offered flour vs. \ud83c\udf3d tortillas either. I love top-shelf Margarita vs. Regular, no difference from the regular one.  I think they get people on their drinks they're expensive and  they used to be really good?  Next time I'll do lunch not dinner, It's an expensive five-star  but you know what you're getting  because of good food and service.",

Not sure I'll be visiting this restaurant again also seeing that a fountain soda was cheaper then a canned soda. That may sound bad since usually a canned soda is usually better then fountain sodas but it was Clover Valley which if you are familiar with the brand is a Dollar General brand and they were pretty much charging you the cost of an entire 12 pack for a single can of soda. I understand that you pay more for drinks and what not when you go out to eat but at least make it a brand that you don't find so easily or if you do don't overcharge by that much for what it is. I highly doubt I will ever return to the restaurant. I'm assuming it was the owner that tried coming up to me before we left to see what was wrong but I was just so over it and not feeling well from all of the salt that I was just ready to leave.",

We all knew what we wanted and when Server asked if we wanted appetizers and said no he said ok I'll be back and was gone before we could give our dinner order. Was there for a special occasion birthday but server was more worried abt his other table with a birthday. Had to call for him to finally place our order to which he told us to hold on and we had to get up to look for him to pay our bills. We were in a rush to leave bc one of us had to work at 11p and had informed him of that but he must not have paid attention. Everything was an excuse, he wanted to make sure we had our drinks before dinner by this time were all empty and no one bothered to order more for fear of it taking too long.",

I had three pieces of shrimp wrapped in bacon, no cheese like it stated on the menu and the appetizer came with frys, sourcream and guacamole which seemed like a very odd assortment. The frys were not good btw. Also the Combination Saltado was very excellent except for the vegetables. Unfortunately they were all raw and were not cooked properly what so ever and also the scallop had a very strange taste to them.",

The kids at our table did not eat more then chips and fries because the kids chicken strips was not fried tenders but rather grilled chicken sliced up. Very disappointed and not a great experience for my first time there.",

We arrived for our dinner reservation with no one attending to the hostess station and had to track down the owner to ask about being seated. The front of the restaurant was packed with people who had been waiting for tables (some for over an hour and a half). We were promised our table for ten would be ready in 10 minutes and an hour and 15 minutes later, after repeatedly reminding the owner that we were waiting to be seated for our 5:30 reservation, they seated 3 other large parties ahead of us who had 6:00 reservations. We never got to eat because we had tickets to a 7:00 show. I even called the day of the reservation, multiple times, to confirm that they would have our table ready for us with a reservation. They didn\u2019t care that they had completely disrespected us and were very dismissive when we told them we were unhappy about how we were treated and couldn\u2019t wait any longer. We never got to try the food, but I have a hard time believing it would have been worth the wait. The sad part is that we were warned by multiple people that this would happen and we still gave them the benefit of the doubt that a reservation meant something. You\u2019ll be disappointed before you even get to a table if you try to eat here!!!",

It describes itself as Spanish/Mexican Fine Dining. We were very pleased with out experience.",
