Ordering online is extremely easy and the time estimate they provide you is actually accurate. Whenever we\u2019ve ordered from them, they\u2019re super quick - no longer than 20-25 minutes.  I will recommend doing takeout from them (whether we are in a pandemic or not). They are definitely a hole-in-the-wall spot and don\u2019t have a ton of seating inside, so don\u2019t go with a big group.  Usually when we order from them, we\u2019re in a sushi rut and go wild ordering 7-9 rolls at a time for the three of us, and they display them so nicely on a tray every time.  The rolls are great for the price and we appreciate the time and effort they take in making our sushi beautifully displayed - it\u2019s like we got catering for our own little sushi night.  Definitely check this spot out!",

It's obvious that they use high quality ingredients and that they put a lot of love into their preparation.  I eat a plant-based diet so I ordered a veggie tempura appetizer. A standard vegetable roll (asparagus, cucumber, avocado) and a tempura vegetable roll and OMG all the veggies were super fresh and crisp and just delicious, and they don't skimp out on the good stuff either and put tons of rice and less of the other stuff like a lot of sushi joints do! These were legit, dense, hearty sushi rolls!  I asked for extra sauce and apparently they usually charge for extra but because I'd already paid with a card, she let it slide. However I would have no problem paying extra seeing as if I paid less than $25 for the entire meal (couldn't even finish all of it because I got full) Super nice folks.  ***There's metered street parking (parallel as well as diagonal parking on the other side of the street) but I kinda cheated and just ran in and got my food and ran back out to my car.***  Great quality, fresh ingredients, superb customer service, inexpensive... I will DEFINITELY be back! \ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udda4",

The food is very very good.  be aware that spicy can be spicy.  Our party included a reluctant participant not interested in spicy or raw anything, but was pleased with a \"spicy pork\" bento box (passed the 3 pieces of california roll to others, but still had a filling meal).  poke bowl looked small, but was filling.  the sushi was made to order by a skilled chef who clearly took pride even in the most elementary requests.  be careful with the parking regulations.  they are clearly posted and marked.",

The tuna was simply dry and that take a number of laying around to get to that state.  Another thing that was kind of shocking is that when I asked for a glass of water they told me, they do not have any and I have to buy a bottled one, which is fine financially, but I have never been refused a glass of water (even in Paris!)  The service was also very bad. Every time I had to get up and go get someone. First it was to take my order, then to remind about other things we have ordered and at the end they actually forgot one. The I had to get up and find someone to ask for the check and then the same thing to actually pay. We had a table and we actually had to get up and go to the bar to pick our orders ourselves. There were 4 of us, so it was quite a few times. If I wanted that type of service, I would have sat by the bar!",
