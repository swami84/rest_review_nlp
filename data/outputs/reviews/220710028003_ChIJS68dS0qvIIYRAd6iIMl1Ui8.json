        "caption": "Went there Saturday night to see what they had. I was tended to fairly quickly. I ordered the Bacon, Avocado, & Jalapeno stuffed burger and tried the Garlic Butter wings. The wings were good. The Garlic Butter sauce was damn good and the fries were soft but the garlic butter made them better. That burger though. They didn't have avocado to use but told the lady no big deal as I had some at home. I asked for extra bacon and jalapenos. I added sliced avocado at the house and took a bite. Damn that burger was good. Thick sliced bacon on a juicy burger. Didn't taste the jalapenos too much but I would go back for that burger. There are a few more I want to try. There were no fries with the meal but that burger could stand on it's own. They also have stuffed baked potatoes I will try but that burger is calling my name. Wish there was a burger and wing plate.",
