        "caption": "I brought my wife to Jont for the \u201cAll In Experience\u201d January 2021. The customized attention that the team gave us started before we even reached the restaurant. When we arrived at The Mandarin Hotel, The Jont team had waiting for us gold-leaf laden chocolate strawberries and a note welcoming us. We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted and seated immediately at the tasting counter. The sommelier along with the chefs guided us through the entire experience, which consisted of something like 20 courses. They had even customized the experience to please my wife, riffing on a Christmas theme since this meal was this year\u2019s gift. Neither me nor my wife drink alcohol, but were surprised that the sommelier put together an elaborate non-alcoholic drink pairing for each course, and it was actually so good that it was a highlight of the dinner. We watched the team of chefs prepare each meal with attention and precision that I have not before witnessed, and before each course one of the chefs or sommelier would describe the course, where the ingredients were sourced, and how they were prepared. It was hands down the best meal of our lives and worth every penny. We had told ourselves that this would be a once in a lifetime meal, but have decided to try to make this trip yearly. My wife was delighted. As we finished the meal, the restaurant had an Uber Black SUV waiting for us, and inside was a gift bag \u2013 they had prepared us breakfast which included fresh squeezed juice and lots of caviar, and had given us custom steak knives engraved with our names. I have traveled the world to eat at Michelin starred restaurants, and this one has been the best by far. Kudos to the team for a job well done, and providing a world-class luxury dining experience. We will return.",

There were 14 tastings (weekend menu) and I liked about half of them. I'm also very picky, so their flavor themes just might not have been my thing. The wagyu was amazing! Melt in your mouth delicious. They had a decent duck breast dish. Also paid $95 per person for truffle service, which I realized was overkill afterwards. Mostly white truffle with a light flavor.

The food: You can tell as you experience the 10-12 course meal that every single bite was so thought out. My favorite bites were the tomato (fun fact, i don\u2019t even like tomato), Concord grape, and of course the duck. I heard the menu changes so curious to see the restaurant evolve!  The experience: incredible. I cannot say enough good things. The attention to detail is impeccable. Best value for the price in the DMV. I know this gem will unfortunately go up in cost as it becomes more well known. So experience it now! You get to watch the chefs prepare your meal - witness the detail and precision that goes behind each bite.  COVID-19 sitch: each chefs counter service has only 14 guests. There are clear dividers on the bar divided up by party. So while it\u2019s intimate, it\u2019s safe. All employees are in masks. Masks are required any time you get up and leave the counter.  This meal was not sponsored, and my feedback is always \ud83d\udcaf truthful.  Check me out on Instagram @alixtakesabite",
