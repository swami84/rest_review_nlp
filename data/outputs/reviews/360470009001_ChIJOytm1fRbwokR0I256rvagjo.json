I ordered the transitional (ground pork) banhmi and Thai tea, it\u2019s consistently delicious every time I come here.  It\u2019s better than the other Vietnamese place (Hanco\u2019s).  If you haven\u2019t been to Banhmigos yet - GO!!  They offer FREE WiFi.  I love this place, the people and the food.  Couldn\u2019t ask for better!",

        "caption": "One of the best bahn mis in Brooklyn hands down. Very traditional to its core. As soon as you bite into the bahn mi it's one of the best things you will ever taste. The pork was savory and well properly seasoned  and the pickled vegetables give it a little nice tanginess to to compliment the well seasoned pork. The French baguette bread gave a very delicious crisp and had a very nice texture that compliment your taste buds. With that savory pork and pickled vegetables it's an unbeatable combination to die for. Must try if you are in the area you wont be disappointed. On top of that the prices are reasonable.",

        "caption": "I ordered the shredded chicken with rice and received what could only be described as a single unseasoned boiled chicken breast cut into small steps with rice. My father had a pho soup that could be likened to hot tap water with noodles and three shrimp sliced to give the appearance of six. Our beverages were even more atrocious as they had the exact same gross aftertaste, meaning that they clearly just use water from the tap. If I could give this restaurant zero stars, I would. They are undeserving of praise in any regard and their food is horribly overpriced for the complete lack of effort put into their unappetizing food.",
