I ordered online, drove for 25 minutes to get there and when I arrived, they told me it would be a half hour more, because of all the orders they got. I can't describe the amazing treatment I got from the lady on the phone. She was so positive, understanding, calm and excellent at customer service! So much so, that I decided to wait in my car for that half an hour. When I got home with my vegan gyro, I could not believe how GOOOOOD it was! AND, they gave me a complimentary huge order of hummus, that's gonna last me a while in the fridge. Simply delicious, good service, even when they had a one hour delay! I can't say good enough things about this place. Please keep catering to us vegans!",

Here's the rundown of what I did try:  Falafel: crispy on the outside, perfect on the inside. Definitely leaves Amsterdam in the dust. Hummus: a tiiiiiiiiny bit spicy. Not an issue for anyone with a normal palate, but a heads up if you're sensitive to that because I would not expect it in hummus. Babaghanoush: amazing. Smooth and less eggplanty than most I have had. Tzatziki: chunky, more of the consistency of spinach artichoke dip than the usual yogurty dip. Labneh: so good. Thick and tangy and yum Zaatar fries: tastes exactly as you'd expect. Doesn't have the weird dryness of Amsterdam curry fries, but also not as crispy. Pita: super soft and fluffy  Note that the dining room isn't anything special and you order at the counter.",

I love that they allow you a long list of side items to choose from. My fave are the shawarma and veggie kebabs and the red cabbage salad. The service is fast, the prices are reasonable. I don't like the unisex bathrooms because there is always a small puddle of pee in front of the toilets.",

I got the lamb pita special, and it truly blew me away. The goat cheese brought a nice creamyness to the pita, and the falafel itself was very flavorful. The mango sauce they have ...oh my wordddd it's to die for. Drizzle it on everything to take it up 3 notches.  At the time that I went, this place had about 50 5-star ratings. Not a single 4 star rating, and I could see why. The staff was super friendly and incredibly helpful, valuable help as well! Not just lame recommendations that don't give you much info.  The inside of the place is a little funky looking, but don't let that deter you from getting some really amazing food.  Stuff my life into that pita /10",
