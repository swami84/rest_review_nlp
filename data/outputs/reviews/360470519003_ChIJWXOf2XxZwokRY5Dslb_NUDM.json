Inside is modern and clean with cool artwork high on the walls.  The food was delicious. Hanger steak was cooked to perfection - true medium rare, seared on the outside pink and bloody in the middle - and delicious with the green topping. The burger and fries also looked delicious.  Relaxed and comfortable, perfect for a chill Saturday on a spring day. Enjoy!",

This was our first visit and we had high hopes for the food here.  To start, the area is beautiful in the courtyard. There\u2019s hanging ivy and the tables are kept a comfortable distance apart. Perfect.  The issue is the food. We ordered quite a few dishes to share between the two of us, and it was just lacklusted. The pita was freshly made, but the pistachio whipped feta was bland and didn\u2019t have chopped pistachios... they were just placed on top. The Brussels sprouts were okay, the sweet potatoes weren\u2019t that great or delicious either.  When the entree came out, Chicken Under A Brick, came to our table I thought it might salvage the experience. It was okay. Nothing flavorful or exotic.  My boyfriend eats everything middle eastern and Mediterranean so for him to barely touch his plate was just sad.  I really wanted to like this restaurant. The staff and the ambiance were wonderful! Our server was so kind and helpful. But, the menu needs to be inspired.",

I would make sure to bring a blanket or wear thicker pants though because the heat lamps don't really warm up your bottom portion. You can view the menu by scanning a QR code which is good especially during these times. It's a pretty pricey place, but I guess it's on par with Williamsburg prices.  For food, we decided to just share the flatbread and 3 dips and a breakfast bowl. The flatbreads had olive oil and za'atar so they already have a bit of flavor. They came out nice and warm. For the dips, we opted for the hummus, babaganoush, and taramasalata. The hummus was pretty standard. I liked the babaganoush and taramasalata better since they had more flavor.  The breakfast bowl had potatoes, sausage, gravy and two poached eggs. It was really hearty, perfect for a cold afternoon. I wish it came with some bread though because it would have been so good to dip it in the gravy with the runny yolk!  Overall, this place is pretty nice. Love the outdoor space and the heat lamps. The food was pretty good although a bit pricey, but it would be a good splurge once in awhile if you are around the area.",

Also had a few bites of the burger that was pretty tasty. Overall I think the food was good, but don't know if I would go out of my way to come back.",

        "caption": "Wow... just wow. Went to the grand opening of Ten Hope BK tonight and I\u2019ll just say it again, wow. I really shouldn\u2019t be surprised as the Chef is Harold Dieterle (Top Chef winner and owned a few awesome restaurants back in the day). Spoiler alert: WOW will be the theme here!  To start, the space is super cool looking. Like a retro deco awesome vibe. Felt very Williamsburg for sure but with a hint of Soho House and a side of hipster.  Went to the bar first and ordered \u201cThe Half Royal\u201d and WOW it was so good. I love bourbon and I love blood orange so no surprise here. Followed it up with 1 more cocktail, \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d and that was... EVEN BETTER!!! I really didn\u2019t even think I\u2019d like it but the sweetness of the rum mixed with whatever that Thai basil black pepper pur\u00e9e was just amazing. The perfect balance.  Sat down and the server was very nice immediately and super knowledgeable about the menu. Was with a friend and ordered the warm flatbreads with dips and seared halloumi with crispy kale to start. The dips were plentiful and WOW, amazing. Each dip better than the next, my favorite was the roasted \u201cbroccoflower\u201d with lemon and anchovy, maybe one of my favorite dips ever. Salty, acidic, light feeling, so good! The seared halloumi was great as well but a bit salty for me, my friend was obsessed with the crispy kale, it was very good.  In the meantime before entrees I ordered one of their house made alcoholic sodas, some Gin and citrus concoction in a bottle. It was so freakin refreshing and light, basically a really really good White Claw, WOW! Perfect palate cleanser and just overall an absolute winner.  Onto the entrees... now keep in mind that everything in the restaurant is \u201cshareable\u201d as per our waitress but you prob won\u2019t want to because you\u2019ll want to eat it all yourself haha. I ordered the Seared Diver Sea Scallops and my friend ordered the \u201cchicken cooked under a brick.\u201d Not an exaggeration, my scallops could not have been cooked anymore perfectly and WOW the golden beets and romesco sauce were the perfect accompaniment. 10/10. My friend and agreed and we ended up sharing both (I was very reluctant to) and it was a GREAT choice!!! The chicken could not have been better, for chicken, ya know? The skin was crispy, chicken moist and tender whatever the sauce was, want to say a spicy green sauce almost like Pio Pio was so freakin good, WOW. I could have poured that on anything!  The check came and with it came some cracked pumpkin seed brittle and my oh my... Harold Dieterle and Ten Hope you did it again, WOW!!! Can not believe how good and addicting it was, I wanted 10 more pieces. I don\u2019t even think you can order it if you wanted to, it came on the house, not even on menu.  If anyone has a chance to get to Williamsburg soon, I have a feeling this place will not be that easy to get into in the very near future! Run, don\u2019t walk.",
