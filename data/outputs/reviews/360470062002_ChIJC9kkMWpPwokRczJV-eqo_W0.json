Of course we couldn't leave without trying the ice cream sandwich. We were able to get 4 different scoops. It was HUGE and SO tasty! The pound cake flavor is a MUST. We\u2019ll deff be back.

Dip that in some home made frite sauce, which is basically a Belgian style mayonnaise, and you\u2019re golden. We tried a few of their sliders as well, so fresh and every slider is made to order!
