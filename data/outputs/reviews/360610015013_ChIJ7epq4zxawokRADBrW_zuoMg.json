There is plenty of HH seating as there are many seats along the bar as well as another row behind. If in the area, its a wonder place for pre-dinner drinks with co-workers, friends and family.

They stoped talking when I walked up to them. But immediatly began talking again as soon as they were done with me( save it for after work)the restaurant area was SUPER LOUD. you could barely hear the person next to you. The server was sloppy she leaned over the table and had her elbows on it wile talking to us. She seemed to pressure me to order food everytime she walked past. The menue had NO vegetarian options. Wich is crazy in this day and age. When I was finally ready to order my server was in the corner by the POS scratching a male employees back. And was talking and flirting with him( super unprofessional) When I finally got my food it was trash. A bowl with bread baked over it and some sugar apple slices inside.  its like a dish a toddler could come up with. I felt bad that my date had to pay for it. The pizza was amazing So one star for that. (And one star for the woman checking the tickets she was kind and smiled).",

We actually came here to celebrate our friend's birthday and wanted a restaurant that was a little bit more unique and this place served that purpose. It looks like a cute mix between speakeasy and library, the walls are large bookcases and just overall decor was just super chiq.  We had a party of 14 people and were seated in the back which was definitely much more intimate and had the feeling that it was a restaurant all to ourselves.  The pre-fix menu was quite nice, there an abundance of food for the price because this is not the first restaurant week that I have ever been to. There was a full three course menu where you walked out feeling...wow I am so full. We started off with a full appetizer, my main course was a salmon - cooked to perfection and the dessert...there were three! Not three options but you got to taste all three!! There was so much desert most of us did not even eat it all. There was a chocolate lava cake, a orange sorbet and ice cream and wow...all three was phenomenal.  Would recommend coming back!",

Chris, our waiter was very helpful in explaining further details on the food. I was really impressed with the food quality and portion size and would certainly return.

The menu lists lardon as well as a pepper relish/Chile that should be on the plate. These two items were missing. That would be fine if they ran out, but they didn't replace those items with anything. The plate really needed something sweet to cut all the salt and fat of the meat and cheese. There wasn't even a stray grape on the plate. I figured no harm no foul -- if I ask for something -- anything -- they should be able to come up with a suitable replacement. I apologized to the bartender and asked for a \"jam or jelly\" or something, figuring he would understand why I was asking because I had the charcuterie plate. He looked confused and then relayed this to someone I assume to be the shift manager or bar manager. This guy laughs right in front of me and repeats  \"jam or jelly??\" Like it was the most ridiculous thing he'd ever heard. I never got any jam or fruit of any kind, and no one even came up to me to say sorry they didn't have anything. It was awkward especially considering I had asked. When I asked for my check the bartender gave it to me without any comment or explanation about the fruit.  This seems like a small thing but it was quite rude to have the manager just laugh at my request, and then have no one even respond to it at all. I won't be going back again unfortunately.  Side note, the specialty punches are super sugary, do not order.",

Service was mediocre at their best. I order a dessert and a drink. It took about 35-40 minutes. I was leaving when they bring me the order. The bartenderAlejandro couldn\u2019t  get me a soda and blame the kitchen for delivering a cold desert. This place is worthless unless you go for the view which is 80% highway and 30% shore. The place is another joke about cheep food and mediocre service.",

I had the chicken schnitzel which is basically a chicken cutlet which came with a small spinach salad that did have a nice taste and some kind of pickled cole slaw type thing that came in a condiment dish but did also taste good. I ordered brussel sprouts on the side because I just love those little buggers. The menu described them as cooked with salt, pepper and lemon but all I could taste was horseradish. When I addressed it with the waiter, he said they don't put horseradish on them... but there definitley was so either I'm crazy or I'm a liar. My husband and youngest also tasted the strong horseradish so that reassured me I'm neither crazy or a liar. The waiter said he would try and get me some prepared the way the menu described but he never did and never brought it back up. My youngest had the special of the day which was salmon. She really enjoyed it. Her plate came with the unusual brussel sprouts and potatoes. Oddly enough, her brussles also had a strong horseradish taste. My husband had the ribs which came with a mango habenaro sauce which he thought was a little too sweet with no taste of habenaro, but still good. His order also came with cornbread that was infused with honey and topped with goat cheese. Personally I didn't taste the cornbread taste at all, but he seemed to enjoy it and that is what matters. We all had iced tea which they make special at $6 a glass. It was ok...tasted like peach flavored unsweetened iced tea. They bring a vanilla bean liquid sweetener if you like sweeter flavored tea. I was dying to try the toffee ice cream cookie with caramel but we were informed they ran out of ice cream. By this point I was done and just wanted to leave and get some real food! What really turned me off about this place was the table behind us ordered alcoholic beverages and after not being out in 5 minutes and without the table complaining, our waiter came by and told them they're drinks were on the way and he was going to give them one of their drinks free because they had to wait. I'm not sure what to think about that, but I felt offended.  I felt he could have at least had the brussel sprouts removed from our check or given us a small percentage off...something! But no! I wouldn't recommend this place, not because of the food... But because the portions are way too small and the prices are way too high. Service started out strong and ended weak. I really can't comment on the cleanliness, because the lighting was very dim. The menu is small and not many choices. Overall, it was a bad experience for me... So there ya go.",

The restaurant on the third floor is modern yet historic, and gives an upscale feel with the decor and the furniture. The view is funny - you basically see car wheels and windows as they drive by on the FDR elevated highway. There\u2019s a very intimate square table that seats eight, and a \u201csecret door\u201d in a bookcase that takes you to a private room. So why only three stars? Because the food is really below standard, and quite expensive. Overcooked burgers, bland salads, cold fries. And one of the worst Pok\u00e9 I have had this side of the pacific. If you seek drinks this will be a fun place in a historic district. If you want to eat, there are plenty better options nearby.",

Nice interior and cool ambience for dinner except that there was a DJ in the bar section so it was a bit noisy and the bass was heavy. Dinner was very good! My  burger was top-tier quality. Appetizers (short rib sliders and farmers pizza) were delicious. Our server Oliver was very nice and helpful, however the water glasses were small so my party was left thirsty throughout the meal, to no fault of the server. We brought our own desert and the kitchen was out of plates so we had to eat off of extra napkins. Not an ideal way to the end the experience. But all-in-all I\u2019d recommend this place to grab a bite near the waterfront. Great Brooklyn Bridge photo ops right across the street!!",

So we sat and wait and one girl come to us and ask what how can she help us, and than we ask for a menu and she responds that it was necessary a reservation and that we need to leave there, so we said sorry and that nobody\u2019s told us anything so we tought it was ok, on the opposite we haven\u2019t sit there, this lady make us feel humiliated and she was really cold . We asked for another table because it was  so many available and she said no. I think this isn\u2019t a way to treat a potential costumer, so it\u2019s like sorry for making you angry it wasn\u2019t our intention we just wanted to eat. And by the way we\u2019re there to pay you not the opposite, we weren\u2019t asking anything for free, so it wasn\u2019t like a favor for us, So just remember the most important thing it\u2019s your costumer!",

We ordered the trio of K Town sliders. Delicious in flavor, but lacking in presentation. Our server offered us a sample of their current scotch infusion, and so we ordered a taste on the rocks. When it arrived we realized the drink was very strong, but the bartender offered to doctor it so that it was palatable. I ordered a house made Ginger beer with blood orange puree. THAT was outstanding!! They must flavor their ginger beer with cardamom and cloves and it really elevated the flavors of the ginger and blood orange. We also noticed there's a speakeasy behind the bookshelf. I give this place a 5 for decor, with an intimate yet chic setting.",
