And the staff for the most part could care less if your there or not. Yes, some staff are helpful but I seriously think management should secret shop this location and retrain the staff to be more friendly, If I order a salad I'll be told to check the shelves, and if I say I wanted it made differently like add or subtract something they make me feel like I'm bothering them. Also the soup seems beyond watered down, and I've seen the pots completely empty with dry soup in it for several days. I still shop at this location because I love Au bon Pain and hope my business will keep it from closeing because I love in the area. But honestly please assist the staff to help customers and upkeep the store so it looks welcoming. This store just needs huge changes or else I dont think it will stay in business.",
