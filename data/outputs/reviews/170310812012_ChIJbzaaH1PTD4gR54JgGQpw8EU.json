The problem was the store was very untidy, I would say not clean/messy for a store selling food/desserts. I was very disappointed coming in to this store.

For over four years I'd pop in and come here for cocoa and pleasing conversation but unfortunately this place is constantly hiring new people so my favorite staff members have long gone namely Mario who always had a kind word to say. Today I came in feeling pretty good and I was craving a hot chai and eclair so the guy in charge today told me the eclairs were available but not properly thawed out even though I got here at 6:39 PM. He was the only server here and the chai was excellent but my eclair was pretty frozen from the inside after I took a bite and the server took it from me realized I had taken a single bite and told me he could not place it in the oven now due to health regulations.  After 4 years of eating here not one person mentioned that they had a points program or loyalty program. I must have visited three or more times a month and no one mentioned the rewards to me till I inquired 7 months ago.  One server explained they are encouraged by the owner never to volunteer that information to customers so after 4 years of my loyalty and not knowing about loyalty points then being served a frozen eclair by a non apologetic and smug server I'll happily stop encouraging my clients to come here and I think I'll find another place to relax. If you take into consideration that these young servers also enjoy gossiping about customers behind behind their backs...like this one girl named Maeve whom I overheard while drinking my cocoa here then you're going to want to get chocolate to go not stay here. This place isn't friendly anymore nor is it welcoming and I was completely disrespected after being served as frozen eclair.  If the owner cares maybe she'll consider refunding me for the eclair tonight but tonight prompted me to write a review especially since a server this past summer complained to me that business here was slow. It's slow because they mistreat customers here and I definitely feel awkward now so I really don't feel compelled to return to this location downtown.   If you want to purchase chocolates as a gift this place is adequate but customer service here is lacking and unfriendly most of the time depending upon who works here on what day of the week. I'm a die hard chocoholic but the ambiance here is lacking if they can't be bothered to reheat a frozen eclair.",

This particular location was nice, it had a small caf\u00e9 where you can sit and enjoy the treats you just bought, which I haven't seen at all I'm Brussels or the Neuhaus I found in DC. This location also had gelato, and the workers were very friendly- offering to make a milkshake per my request even though it was off the menu.

Every time we would visit London, we'd take a dozen boxes of Leonidas home with us.  Or if someone was visiting from London, we'd ask them to bring a few boxes with them.  The chocolates from here are exquisite!  My favorite kind has always been the Manon Cafe, which is white chocolate with a coffee buttercream inside topped with a hazelnut.  I also like the Gianduja, which is rich almond/hazelnut praline covered in gold wrapping.   I opted to get only a few items when I visited yesterday since I was pretty much chocolated-out from a chocolate tour that we just completed.  However, there's no doubt I'll return for more!  Leonidas also offers marzipan, macaroons, and gelato in addition to their chocolates.  I'll probably try these too sometime in the near future.",
