When they have you pay, they bring around a small credit card machine with only the total showing (nothing itemized). We tipped there and got an itemized receipt after the fact showing that gratuity was already added, thus double tipping without knowledge or consent. We called after realizing and they basically said too bad so sad. Shady practices, ask for an itemized receipt before going.",

I ordered the salad and it was a solid salad, wasn\u2019t a fan of the dressing myself but that\u2019s my taste. There was a good wait to finally be seated but once we did the atmosphere of The Dime was very trendy and upbeat. They take pride in being from Chicago which is lovely to see. More on the food side, the chicken was very tender and juicy. Looked forward to my next chicken bite on my salad. I also snagged some waffle fries from my partner and the seasoning on the fries is very delicious. We also had a margarita pitcher which was slightly on the stronger slide but we weren\u2019t complaining! Nice to finally see a place that is a bit heavier handed on the liquor side. It was very refreshing too considering it was a humid day. I\u2019d like to give this place another shot once this pandemic is over to update my review.",

Had a couple of the appetizers - really yummy (fried cheese curds & fried chicken) I was expecting typical bar food and got something more upscale - nice surprise. My drink was perfect, nice and strong. The dimes are embedded on the bar top. Kinda cool. Cool vibe, good music. I\u2019ll definitely come back.",
