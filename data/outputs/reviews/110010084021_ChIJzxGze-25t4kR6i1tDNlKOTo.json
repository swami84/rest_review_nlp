My friend has heard great reviews and wanted to come to this establishment. It is too much to pull from about the experience. But I will make a list:  1. Our wait time was 4 hours for a table. (While waiting outside we saw a 4 table top being used by the owner and some friends). Instead of allowing paying customers to sit.  2. After being sat by the host Jennifer she informed us about a 60 minute limit. After we sat down at the table where it took 20 minutes for our table to be attended too. Then it was an additional 15 minutes to get drinks then place orders.  3. One of our appetizers had hair in the food. Our food came out about the hour mark. Jennifer the hostess came to the table little over an hour to say we should, \u201cEat up\u201d because we were over an hour. (This is my assumption)  4. After we got our food the waitress didn\u2019t come back to the table for 20 minutes to see if everything was okay.  5. We were ready to place an additional to go order when we were informed we could no longer sit at the table because we were over the 60 minute limit. We would have to wait outside for our take out order.  6. My original order for take out went missing. Instead of the waitress to put the order in she comes to the table to say she didn\u2019t know where it went. As if that\u2019s my concern.  7. When the take out was brought to the table it looked like it was scrapped from the bottom of the bin and was not packaged well.  8. We called the manager, Warren, over to inform him of our concerns. He was very dismissive about our concerns. He tried to address the fact we were over out 60 minute limit. Warren did \u201ctry\u201d to help out by giving us the missing meal \u201ccomped\u201c and a discount on our bill.  Overall, they need to work on hospitality and service skills. Better sanitation with handling food. I will not be returning but I hope they get better.",

Dining in is limited to about 60 minutes, which isn't bad at all and at no time did service feel rushed. Mimosas aren't bottomless, but they offer a pitcher for a decent price. I usually hate the concept of chicken with a breakfast food, but their Chicken & French Toast was AMAZING. They complimented one another in the best way possible. Literally everything was delicious. I also order some mumbo wings to go, and they were phenomenal as well. Definitely visiting again!",

Several items were not available on the menu and my party of 6 was very understanding through it all. After spending over $750.00, we were rushed and told by the manager he \"let us stay for 2 hours when the allotted time is 1 hour.\" Despite the obvious signs we were leaving as we were paying our checks, the manager decided he needed to rush us to finish our drinks and leave the establishment.

All company members kept mask on as well as wore gloves. We got the buffalo lemon pepper shrimp, oxtail spring rolls , hot fried chicken sandwich and chicken and French toast.. everything tasted amazing. Only wish was that the shrimp were hotter. To cap off the evening the crab boss was in there. It was dope to see black businesses/ business men supporting each other. We will be back..",

Sheeeeee knooowwwwsss how I felt about that dish!!!! \ud83d\ude0d  What I will say:  GOOD OPENING EXPERIENCE. Staff seemed to support each other as well as they engaged us, customers. Brielle (?) was eager to usher me to my party but then stood ready to listen if my party was a date that ghosted me. Though that was not my story for the evening, Brielle reinforced that sisterhood bond, sense of community, care and safety that's important to ppl traveling solo! That action, by itself, demonstrated a level of hospitality that was majorly appreciated and not-so-common.  BACK TO THE FOOD.  Yuuummm! Like, frfr YUMMM.  Short rib egg roll grew to be a tad salty after eating the 2nd portion BUT the mumbo sauce balanced things out.  Btw, THANK YOU FOR MUMBO SAUCE #3rdGenDC  I'd DEFINITELY order the mussels again. And that margarita was HITTING. It completely hit the mark!  I'm guessing that decor and mood elements will be incorporated soon. The corner, street-level view DOES benefit from being without heavy window dressings but perhaps some frosted glass art would offer enough visual interest for passersby while slightly privatizing tablespaces for indoor diners.  Sound you go? I say yes. ENJOY YOURSELF",

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE The waiter Zee was extremely personable and gracious. She checked our temperatures, guided us to our table and explored the menu with us, having given great recommendations on what good items to try. Once we ordered our appetizers and drinks, she realized we would need more room, and relocated us to a table that would best fit all the meals we had forthcoming.  Our waiter was extremely knowledge about the menu and was able to give us his best recommendations on what items to order. While dining, we were greeted multiple times by the servers, waitresses and by the manager himself, in order to ensure that we were fully enjoying our food and dining experience.  THE FOOD & DRINKS The Flavored Mimosas: extremely flavorful and weren\u2019t heavy on the juice. They were served in a large carafe and were full of fresh, delicious fruit  Fried Chicken Deviled Eggs: Amazing! They were fried to perfection and were a cross between being both sweet and savory.  Ox-Tail Egg Rolls: Extremely delicious! Never had anything like it, and they were served with a sauce resembling Mambo Sauce that boosted the flavor 10x more  Fried Jerk Shrimp: served on a long platter and were seasoned to perfection and lightly fried. The bleu cheese served with them provided a nice balance to their tangy taste  Fried Catfish and Crab Grits: the fish was so good and made me feel like I was back in the south, and the crab and cheese grits were nice, rich and hearty. It was also a nicely-sized portion, which makes me definitely want to order it again!  Coconut Curry Lobster: sooo delicious and was just what I needed! The curry was nice and flavorful and the lobster and shrimp were so succulent. Easily one of my favorite dishes, hands down.  Strawberry Crumb Cake: rich, moist and decadent. Couldn\u2019t finish it all, but it definitely stimulated my taste buds  Banana Pudding: this was some heavenly stuff and will definitely make you wanna slap ya mama! I highly recommend saving room for this dessert - while the appetizers and entrees were delightful, this Banana pudding definitely enhanced my overall dining experience  Overall, I HIGHLY recommend checking this place out if you haven\u2019t already! The vibe was nice, the staff were super cool, and for this to be a brand new business, I can definitely see them only going up from here!",

I pulled up to the restaurant at 11:56 in at 11:57I received a text that my order was ready so I masked up, sanitized. Y hands, grabbed my lysol wipes and went into the restaurant.  No one spoke or greeted me.  Finally I asked a young lady about my order number 84.  I waited for 10 minutes while watching all the others orders numbered after 84 go out.  Meanwhile there is NO SOCIAL DISTANCING happening and it is packed inside.  I see the young lady and a woman who appears to be a manager talking and looking at me.  They never come to me to update me but keep talking and looking at me. So finally after 5 more minutes I ask the manager about my order.  She responds \u201cI\u2019m looking for your order\u201d and shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly.  What does that even mean?  How did you lose my order when I walked into the restaurant 3 minutes after receiving the text?  I explained to her that I would never have gotten out of my car if my order wasnt ready and that I had been standing there for 15 minutes surrounded by people who weren\u2019t social distancing.  She repeats \u201cI\u2019m looking for your order\u201d and shrugs her shoulders again!  Next thing I know she\u2019s handing me a receipt.  I asked her what it was for and she said, \u201cyou seemed unhappy so I refunded your order\u201d. She didn\u2019t talk to me or try to fix things.  No apology, nothing for the inconvenience...just cancelled, refunded my order and handed me a receipt without a word.  Of course i was unhappy...I was standing there waiting for my food for 15 minutes AFTER I had been texted that it was ready in a scorching hot restaurant with no social distancing only to be treated like I was bothering someone because I wanted my $80 order.  I told her I did not want a refund I just wanted my food and she repeated \u201cwell you seemed unhappy and I have to deal with this social distancing issue\u201d.  She was unprofessional and dismissive and seemed to have no high volume restaurant management skills whatsoever because of she did, she would have delegated the social distancing issue to the 4 employees hanging out In the hallway socializing, since every single person in there was allowed to walk past them and enter the restaurant without so much as a word.  I was really looking forward to my food but this is the second time I\u2019ve had an issue with my order here and that was pre-COVID...and at least that time I was offered a free mimosa for the ridiculous, extended wait! I wanted to give them another chance because they\u2019re Black owned and it\u2019s black-out week but Never again!  If you can\u2019t manage a restaurant without being overwhelmed and rude you need to find another profession.",
