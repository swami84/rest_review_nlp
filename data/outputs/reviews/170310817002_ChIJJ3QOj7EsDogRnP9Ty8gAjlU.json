From the moment I called to set up a reservation, to the moment we concluded our dinner, we have been accommodated like kings and queens. The attention to detail in setting up the reservation: food sensitivities, table set up, preordering the appetizers, ensuring that we had our private area for our family to mingle,(just a few to mention) was exquisite.  The food was delicious, small piece of advice here, I think we went a little heavy on the appetizers, which were so good, that by the time we had to order entrees we were a little too full.  The space is beautifully decorated, lighting was perfect to instill a romantic, intimate and relaxing atmosphere  coupled with Frank Sinatra\u2019s songs, it makes on forget about all the stresses of the current times we live in.  While respecting all the city guidelines for indoor dinning, it is safe to say that for a few hours that we spent here, we were able to relax and enjoy each other\u2019s company much like pre-Covid times.  If you are planning a small intimate event, this is the place to be!",

You need to make reservations, either standard seating, outside or at the bar. Temp check once reservation has been confirmed. Hand sanitizer stations. Mask must be worn at all times unless eating or drinking, especially when staff approach you. Bathrooms (yes, I said plural, 3 to be exact and 2 are spacious) the signs in the bathroom are fun facts when it comes to hand wash time. Ok! Now the food is amazing! Recommend the Tuscan bread for an app. You can taste quality in everything. Drinks are clean and strong (esp cocktails). Recommend the Jimmy 2 times or an old fashion which was prepared PERFECTLY. Anything u order is going to taste great. Allergies are reported to the chef. N95s are worn by all staff. My server was Axel and he was just the BEST! They really made me feel anxiety free during this rough time.",

We were seated promptly. The acoustics is quite noisy when the place is hopping - which is was. Our server was friendly and offered good advice when asked. Caution - be aware of the incredibly aggressive bus staff. Hang onto your plates if you're not finished. There's efficiency and then there's rudeness, and this bordered on the latter.",

There are ways I felt discriminated against, as if I were going to order or I was going to leave without paying my bill, it was really unpleasant the moment since my intention was only to try the lasagna but I never return to that place.  (Original) Les comentar\u00e9 un poco de lo mal que me ha ido en este sitio, no escribo desde mi molestia solo que no quisiera que otra persona le ocurriera lo mismo, llegamos el d\u00eda S\u00e1bado hambrientos a visitar y conocer, al parecer ese d\u00eda hab\u00edan cambiado algunas regulaciones de la ciudad debido al COVID 19 cosa que entendemos y respetamos pero nosotros un grupo de 4 desconoc\u00edamos sobre esto y nos sentamos con mucha hambre y cansados del largo viaje, luego de estar sentados al pasar un rato se nos acerca gentilmente un mesonero al rededor de las 9 pm para preguntarnos si le dijimos a la Host que nos daba tiempo, ya que la cocina cerraba a las 9:30 pm ya sab\u00edamos lo que \u00edbamos a pedir porque hab\u00edamos escaneado el men\u00fa y nos levantamos ya que ella no pudo ir hasta donde nosotros nos dijo sin mediar palabras que deb\u00edamos retirarnos ya que no pod\u00edamos por nuevas regulaciones cosa que pudimos entender a pesar del mal rato porque el hambre que ten\u00edamos sin embargo no fue la mejor manera, pero como soy amante de la pasta decid\u00ed volver el d\u00eda lunes a pesar que me estaba hospedando a media hora de all\u00ed pero haciendo bien las cosas y procedimientos llame para reservar a las 3 pm, nos confirmaron para las 8:15 pm el cual nos preparamos para ir a cenar tomamos el taxi y decid\u00ed ir solo con mi amigo ya que la pareja decidi\u00f3 quedarse porque no tuvieron una buena experiencia el d\u00eda S\u00e1bado, lleg\u00f3 al sitio puntual me bajo y la host me dice que si vengo de alg\u00fan estado que est\u00e1 en la lista desafortunadamente no nos podemos sentar que lo siente oh mi Dios esto es enserio? No pudiste preguntarnos por tel\u00e9fono si \u00e9ramos turistas o de cu\u00e1l ciudad nos visitan? Hay maneras me sent\u00ed discriminado, como si yo fuera a pedir o me fuera a ir sin pagar mi cuenta fue realmente desagradable el momento ya que mi intenci\u00f3n era solo probar la lasa\u00f1a pero nunca m\u00e1s vuelvo a ese sitio.",

When I got there with my BF the lady who work there as a host asked me where we came from and she rejected us because we came from Florida and because of that we were not allow to eat in but the real true about this is that at that time there wasn\u2019t any table available for us and because we are Hispanic they want us to be out of their restaurant. I will never come back to that place and I wish the owner and everyone else read this since they don\u2019t deserve it. We felt very discriminated as We never felt and without any sorry from there part. We are all humans and we deserve respect and courtesy to each other. If the Florida issue was the real excuse the person who took the reservation on the phone should have asked and warning me about the restrictions to save us me time on Planning my night to go over there and have such a bad experience, but because this was just a way to not welcome people they don\u2019t want there they are just  taking advantage of covid situation and use it as an excuse in this difficult time for everyone to only allow people they just want in their restaurant and not look as a place who discriminate people. Place pick another place we find another Italian restaurant two blocks away and it was delicious and we didn\u2019t have any problem getting in.",

I make tasty homemade sauce, but mine has NOTHING on there's. I don't know what they do, but there is so much flavor in there sauce. Even the chicken (chicken parmesan) had all this flavor and was very tender. I was stuffed full, but still finished my meal because i couldn't stop eating it. I don't live in Chicago and that makes me sad, because I won't be able to eat here all the time. Even the vinaigrette they use on the Italian salad was amazing. To top in off, the service is above board. Very attentive and nice. Could not recommend this place more. Do yourself a favor and eat here.",

We got the Burrata Bruschetta, Green Chopped Salad, Fruitti Di Mare, and Tiramisu cake from the RW menu and also ordered the  Fettuccine Alfredo which I thought was a good balance between two people.  The Bruschetta was easily the worst dish. The bread was over-toasted, and difficult to eat which really took away from the flavors. It also seemed like the dish was pre-made as it came out pretty quick so a little disappointed with this one.  The chopped salad was pretty good, although it was a bit spicy from the pepperoncini seeds. I do enjoy spice, but just a warning in case. The  Frutti Di Mare and Fettuccine Alfredo were good, and the Tiramisu was great, and perfect size.  Overall, it was a good experience. Service was good, food was a bit forgettable, but overall Il Porcellino provides a cool ambiance and it's a nice date night spot.",

It was raining so hard all day so it seemed like all the tourists were just hunkering inside wherever they could find a good warm, dry spot. There were no reservations available but we were told we could wait for a table for an hour and 45 minutes... Never having eaten here before, we weren't sure it'd be quite worth that long of a wait...  We thought we would check open table one more time before committing to another establishment and lo and behold...we got a table for 10 minutes from now!! We basically dashed out of the bar we were taking shelter in and sat in a Lyft for about 7blocks of gridlocked traffic (which hurt my soul...but we got fully drenched walking a couple blocks to the bar we were at).  We got to Il Porcellino about 5minutes late and were seated right away at a high top by the bar.  We got a caprese salad which was terrific! 5/5! The waitress said there was no vinegar but there was a mystery acid that gave it just the right amount of zing. Delicious!  I got the sausage orichette and it was very good! 8/10. Would eat it again.  The star of the evening was the chicken parmesan. Basic I know (my wife ordered it\ud83d\ude09), but, like the darling she is, my wife let me eat about half of it. Oh my goodness it was terrificly delicious. I'm going to have to come back to Chicago just to eat here for my birthday! 110/100!  The chocolate cake was also stupendous. 100% recommend! Very delicate and so flavorful.  Our waitress was also awesome! She is actually a bartender but waited on us at the high top. She was from LA and very friendly. But not so friendly where they're borderline annoying, you know what I mean? She was great!  Can you tell I enjoyed my meal here?",

We ordered the whole loaf bread, stuffed mushrooms, calamari and the green chopped salad as appetizers. Don't sleep on the bread here. It was extra fluffy inside and with the combination of warm butter and garlic it was delicious. If you salad do yourself a favor and order the green chopped salad. This is no mediocre salad as they pack on the kale, cheese, nuts and great vinaigrette dressing.  As for the entrees, we ordered the tortellini al forno, orecchiette, pappardelle alla porcellino and the gnocchi bolognese. You can tell everything here is really fresh. As the pastas had great texture. I enjoyed the gnocchi the most because they cooked it really well the seasoning in the bolognese was delicious. The orecchiette and pappardelle were very good as well.  My friends and I really enjoyed our dining experience here as well. We left stuffed. The ambience here is great as they have indoor ceiling light features. We saw large parties start coming in around 6 PM. They have great seating to accommodate medium to large size parties. Highly recommend this place if you want awesome quality pasta and Italian food overall.",

I went with their kale salad, a great take on an overdone dish, and did the bolognese lasagna with spicy broccolini. I finished it off with a pistachio affogato. All of it was absolutely excellent. The bartender, Ashway, and the manager, Lauren, attended to me all night and I could not have been happier with my experience.  Also, a lot of Italian places like to go for a \"classic\" or \"sheik contemporary\" look and it always fails. The lighting and design of the place is super chill and welcoming. Do yourself a favor and get here ASAP. So good. I will definitely be back.",

The one thing I will say about the food: one of my friends got a salad and it was literally one of the largest salads I've seen, but everyone else ordered pasta and the everyone's portion was tiny which was the most disappointing part about dinner.

First off, the d\u00e9cor is so beautiful and so charming - soft lights, stylish interior with the perfect touch of rustic. Secondly, the service is unparalleled-which I cannot say about most restaurants in Chicago, especially in River North. If you get so lucky, you will get Peter as your server. He personally goes above and beyond to attentively accommodate your needs and dietary needs. As any Vegan victim knows, it is nearly impossible to have a fuss-free Italian restaurant experience, and he made it his mission to ensure I was well taken care of.",

And their sauce was delicious.  Desert, was tiramisu and again I was not disappointed. Our waitress BTW was the best waitress ever!  I wish I could remember her name, but she always finished her sentence with a \"yes sir\" or a \"yes ma'am\".",

On a recent visit several tables halfway across the room were louder the the ones nearby, and that detracts from the experience. I realize large parties are important, but their preference fot raucous volume should not be at the expense of other guests. A savvy manager could balance things to the benefit of all.  Also, the food is uneven, with the Caesar salad as bland as iceberg. The signature gnocchi has a edgy spice in the sauce, something that stands out rather than fits into the overall taste.  The meatballs Orsini are good, but the polenta was runny, almost watery, instead of creamy.  The mushrooms complement the meatballs well, though. For the wines, some good selections are on the menu.  It is just a little uncomfortable when other tables are pressed against you. (People do not have to push their chairs out across an aisle and into your back, right?) The food deserves less rustic customers.  To the owner's credit, he did respond to my message about returning. The corner table did not work out with the staff, though.  Appending a note: Other reviews indicate that bar seating was possible. When we waited 20 or so minutes, the greeter had us stand.",

Service was excellent, enjoyed stuffed mushrooms and bacon ravioli, complemented with a nice red wine that was recommended by my server. It was amazing. No other way to say it. After a great dinner, I moved over to the bar for a nice drink to warm me up for my walk back. They where hopping. My bartender, Ashway, is a pro in everyway. Always calm with a smile and creating an array of beautiful, perfect cocktails. I ordered a drink off the menu and she made it perfect, while taking care of more than 20 other people sitting and standing around the bar. This IL Porcelino is now one of my favorite spots and I will be returning.",

Music volumn was just right - not obnoxiously loud, but still enough to keep a romantic atmosphere going when you and your dinner date just want to silently enjoy the food. 5 stars.  That being said, the food was pretty good. We got the Tuscan cheese bread. Must get!! So fluffy and cheesy and perfect with the marinara. They also gave complimentary 2 tiny balls of arancini. Free food is cool. 5 stars.  I got the ragu pasta. Tasty but I feel like I could've gotten that at another Italian place. Eh... 3.5 stars.  Boyfriend got the Berkshire pork. Yes, it's not super Italian, but he enjoyed every bite of it. I took some notes and had to agree that it was melt-in-your-mouth good. 5 stars!  Dessert... They recommended the salted caramel semifreddo, which I saw others raved about in their reviews too, so we got it. But.... Maybe it's because I usually don't care about salted caramel... But I thought it s nothing to write home about. 3 stars.  Price-wise, I felt it was a little overpriced for what you get, but being not from Chicago, maybe my opinions are a bit biased. HOWEVER! sign up for their emails and you get $25 off of $50 or more as a welcome gift.  So with the coupon, our meal came out to be a little less than $50. You can't beat that!",

We specifically told him none of us eat pork products so please inform us if we order a dish with pork.  We ordered the brussel sprout appetizer minus the bacon.  (Side note, the restaurant lighting is very dim.) The dish came out and a few of the girls had tasted it.  One of the girls stated she smells something smoky. We opened our phone flash lights and we seen BACON!  Waiter was not around so we asked an employee clearing a table for the manager.  We explained to the manager it was against our religion to eat pork and we were very upset. He apologized and that's all. No explanation, just a sorry and kept it moving. We all sat in complete shock. Our entrees came out right after and one was missing because the waiter didnt input it in the system and another had chicken (the girl asked for no chicken).  At that moment we left. We couldn't handle their stupidity and disrespect anymore.  Avoid this restaurant. There are many other wonderful restaurants in the city.",

For us, the main criteria is ambience for which i would give full 5 stars because it was lovely inside as well as music was lit!! About the food , from the options i found, the garlic bread is a must try and would be honest that if was one of the best i had.. we also tried brussels sprouts without bacon with parmesan cheese which was aptly crisp, we loved that too. We ordered Rigatoni alla vodka which was not bad but would not give 5 stars. Drinks were also very nicely presented and it tasted good. I would like to make special mention about our server, i dnt remember her name but she was so pleasant and guided through the menu so nicely. Overall experience was great and would highly recommend it for a date or with group of friends!!",

I was concerned looking at the menu that I wouldn't have much to eat besides the sides and a salad, which is doable, just not conducive to a good time. I was pleasantly surprised that there is a vegan option for pasta. I ordered that, and also inspired others at my table to order the same. The only hiccup is that the order came incorrectly the first time, and had to be sent back, but it tasted pretty good. Nothing to write home about, but filled me up. I would like to suggest that some lettuce restaurants try incorporating some more vegan options in terms of protein, but I know that dream is far from coming true. If you're vegan and you're coming here, you won't be hungry, but won't be the best food you've ever eaten.",

He made the dining experience go from a 10/10 to a 20/10. Eric was clearly passionate about the restaurant and the people who he was serving.

When I told them we couldn't wait that long, they offered no resolution so we just asked them to cancel our reservation. A few hours later, I received an email from Open Table saying that the restaurant marked us as a No Show for our reservation and the email made a point to mention the adverse affects on restaurants of No Shows, which was rather annoying considering the restaurant was the one running late and we had asked them to cancel it, which they obviously did not. I hear the food is good here, but unless they improve the way customers are treated and how they honor reservations, I won't be back.",

Despite having made a reservation for a later time, I came in a little early to see if they could take us early during their peak hours.  After a short wait, I was seated. I had ordered the calamari and salads that were light and not overfilling.  Everyone was happy with the entrees. I enjoyed the linguini and clams and most of the desserts were decent. If I had a second chance, I'd avoid the tiramisu.  Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and let me know of a points program that worked with their restarsunt and other restaurants in the network.  the scene was vibrant with moderate to loud noise. They have a bar which did not have my favorite top shelf spirits but instead had craft spirits. The bar was just as busy with people eating there and /or waiting for a table.  Waiting area is kind of crowded so I gladly hung out in the bar area with a drink. Ask the bartender to find your \"like\" spirit.  In all a great experience with a lively crowd that will surely start your night off right. I initially selected this place because of the positive yelp reviews and I'm glad they got this right",

Saw lots of people walk in and leave at the wait times, I can say, it's worth the wait.  The chicken vesuvio, braised short ribs and Berkshire pork are all amazing. Both the breads, calamari and the truffled risotto were fantastic.  Staff is attentive and on point. Had a small issue with 1 dish, it was removed, replaced and comped without a fuss.  A must if your visiting the city in my opinion.",

We started with an order of the kale salad with avocado, it was great until he was chewing and pulled a rubber band out of his mouth. Apparently was from the asparagus bundles. So that wasn\u2019t a great start. Minus the rubber band he said the salad was good. Then our pastas came out. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Im Italian so I know a good spaghetti when I try it and this fell short. It came out luke warm and it was probably sitting for a while because the sauce looked very watery almost soupy. It also was one of those sweeter red sauces. It kind of reminded me of spaghettios from a can consistency. So that was a fail. Luckily my husband traded and gave me his pappardelle ragu which was very hot (temp wise) which I loved. The overall dish was very tasty. I\u2019d like to give this place another try maybe in the future but the first impression was some what disappointing. The manager was nice and apologized about the rubber band, we understand things happen,, was more upset about my dish. Especially because I\u2019m pregnant and I had a craving for spaghetti and meatballs, which was probably one of the reasons my husband traded with me ! Hopefully the next time we come we will have a better experience and I can change my opinion of the place. (Just avoid the spaghetti/ meatball dish)",

I like that they start you off with a free appetizer. It\u2019s s nice touch. The staff is always friendly and goes out of their way to make your visit the best.  Sit at the bar and watch their bartenders make their drinks as you chow down. Or sit at the windows at watch the world go by. Wherever you sit you\u2019ll enjoy a great meal.",
