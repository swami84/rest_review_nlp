I'm Italian and we made our own pasta as a child so trying a restaurants homemade pasta is a must for me.  The ambiance is awesome!  I love the old town feel with the brick walls and cozy booths.  Now the food...the meat and cheese apps were fantastic...especially the prosciutto and parmesan balsamic cheese.  And the bread served with the meat and cheese were off the charts!  The artichoke hearts were prepared perfectly as well!  I would have been happy staying in app land but had to try the pasta too of course.  I opted for the Rigatoni and it was fabulous.  The pasta was excellent and the fresh mushrooms and short ribs in it were spot on.  My coworker had the risotto special and that dish was full of flavor and richness as it should.  All that to say, the food was excellent and we didn't leave feeling \"restaurant bloated\"  And I must give props to our server Shaina.  Even if the meal was just okay (which it wasn't, it was great!), she definitely made the evening even better!  She was so friendly and knowledgeable and was a pleasure to have taking care of us!!  She came around the right amount of time.  She gave us time to visit yet made sure we were taken care of.  She embodies the \"perfect\" server at a restaurant like this and I'm glad we had her taking care of us.  All in all, a fantastic experience and I highly recommend this place!  We'll be back for sure!!",

Our appetizers were absolutely delicious. The pasta was slightly undercooked for me, but that might have been personal preference and the flavors were spectacular. The reason I am giving 3 stars is due to the service we received. We made reservations over a month in advance and were seated about a foot away from the door. There was a curtain to stop some of the breeze, but the 27\u00b0 breeze was hitting our legs and feet every time someone left. After we finished our appetizers, I asked if we could be placed elsewhere because it was taking away from the experience. The hostess eventually came over and said, \" We can put you at that booth over there but it's a small venue so you will probably feel it over there too.\" She was incredibly condescending and sounded like something my mother would've said to me as a child. She made us feel inconsiderate when, logically, the cold is not going to be as intense if we're sitting 30 feet from the door versus 2. The food was great, but the attitude of the service was deplorable.",

        "caption": "My wife and I are new to Boise. We stumbled upon \u00c0LAVITA 2 weeks ago after searching yelp while downtown.  We walked in on a Friday night and as expected it was very busy. No tables available due to reservation but the staff was very friendly about letting us use the full service bar.  The inside of the restaurant is literally perfect. It\u2019s small maybe 30 tables, but the atmosphere was perfect. Buzzing full of chatter. The open kitchen is a nice touch as you can see the kitchen staff at work pumping out some amazing food.  The highlight of our food-  The Burrata. The creamy burrata is served on a apricot jam that mixes perfectly with the salty burrata. Toasted bread to accompanying it.  My wife and I ordered Tagliatelle and Squid Ink Bucatini.  The Tagliatelle was a pure experience. The Chicken Sugo was creamy and had an depth of flavor that you can only achieve with long roasted the chicken and a delicious tomato sauce. It was topped with more Burrata and a drizzle of olive oil.  Squid Ink Bucatini was such a beautiful dish. You have this beautiful black pasta that is coated in a slightly spicy tomato sauce, breadcrumbs, capers, shrimp and calamari. The calamari was so soft and not like rubber bands. I can\u2019t wait to order this again.  The desserts we shared were the Chocolate olive oil cake with peppered toasted marshmallow and the salt caramel gelato. This dish you have to us both to make marriage. The cake is soft and moist and not sweet, adding the peppered marshmallow and the sweet gelato is a perfect blend.  The Poached Pear. Where do you start? The pear perfect. It\u2019s slightly firm sitting in a pool of zabaione, if you don\u2019t know what is, it\u2019s what dreams are made of. This is a perfect finish to the night.  The Staff. Knowledgeable, friendly and professional. The staff knew everything about the dishes and explained everything when we had questions.  In closing the chef and staff understand balance, flavor and restraint. We cannot wait to come back.",

The sister restaurant Fork serves better pasta & that shocks me! Buccatani recommended was barely warm & had almost no flavor & the cheese on top was almost frozen so it made the dish colder. And the papperdelli pasta with spicy sausage was extremely spicy but at least the sauce had flavor. Sadly the pasta was the true let down & it sucks cause homemade pasta is the best thing in the world or at least it should be...  And I was shocked at the menu as it's supposed to be seasonal but it was still set up for August more so then mid October. 95% of the pasta dishes were tomato based & part of the reason I went was for an Alfredo as I have food allergies & this & Fork are one of only three restaurants in the valley who use Cloverleaf Cream. I have watched all their videos making pasta & honestly I have had boxed pasta with more flavor & that made me sad. At least salt the water please.... Maybe it was just a bad night but I was so disappointed. And as a side note could the chef go over to Fork & be taught how to make potatoes? Fondant potatoes are not just a fancy shaped boiled potato, they are supposed to be crispy & golden brown on the outside & creamy luscious on the inside.. Best thing on the menu was our appetizers & desserts! Seriously I will dream about those artichokes! But my take away should have been about amazing pasta \ud83d\ude22",

Ordered the blood orange Bellini it was different but really good. Same with bruschetta app, I think there was butternut squash (which I\u2019m typically not a fan of) a mild citrus flavor, and I actually really enjoyed it even though it was different. Husband ordered the special, it was a risotto, the best we\u2019ve ever had! Really, SO good! I opted for something more traditional, spaghetti & meatballs.

Our waiter was Casey, he was perfectly friendly and did a wonderful job offering us the perfect balance of privacy and warmth. The food was delicious, especially the black ravioli. Very reasonably priced for such a nice meal, we were able to have drinks, appetizer, two of the pricier entrees and dessert for under 100 bucks, something practically unheard of in Seattle. The ambiance is intimate and sultry, really great for a date night. Overall I was really shocked that we could get an experience even nicer than one in Seattle in much cozier Boise, yet another reason to add to my ever growing list of reasons I'm glad I moved. We will FOR SURE become repeat customers and are excited to patron Fork as well. Bravo!",

It was truly one of the best Italian meals we\u2019ve ever had. We sat at a small 2 top in the front bar area, vibe was cozy with Frank Sinatra playing in the background. Ordered the blood orange Bellini it was different but really good. Same with bruschetta app, I think there was butternut squash (which I\u2019m typically not a fan of) a mild citrus flavor, and I actually really enjoyed it even though it was different. My friend ordered the special, it was a risotto, the best we\u2019ve ever had! Really, SO good! I opted for something more traditional, spaghetti & meatballs. The pasta was super fresh and we really enjoyed everything we had. I\u2019d love to go back if we are ever visiting again.",

A good example was the pistachio canoli we had for dessert:  it didn't have the usual canoli filling, traditional canoli shell, or any taste of pistachio. Instead of a dollop of whipped cream on the side, they smeared it around the rim of the plate for presentation.  Weird.  I think Asiago's is a better option if you want traditional Italian food.",

The unfriendly hostess indicated I could either sit at the bar, or the one table right next to her and five feet from the door. I have balance issues so double checked if no other table was available (it was the worst in the place). Nope and double nope. Sat down to dinner. 10 minutes later two men arrived without reservations. The manager greeted them and offered them an excellent table, or the bar. They sat at the bar. Afterwards, I asked the hostess about the better availability. She indicated there must have been a mistake as the better table was reserved. Ten minutes later a couple arrived without reservations. They were seated at the better table. Not very professional at all.",

Their cocktails are not as inventive as The Modern, but they do the basics very well, and they do some interesting things with smoke. Their Rock & Rye, with horehound tea is emblematic of what they do best: a well executed standard with a slight twist.  Their food is quite good\u2014better than most in Boise\u2014but a tad overpriced for what it is. For example, their shortrib meat balls over linguini comes with excellent meatballs, tasty house made pasta, and a sauce that is plain boring. Their Cavatelli (house-made sausage and broccoli on house-made pasta) ranges from heavenly to bad. Four of six times it has been quite good, once it was amazing, and once it was bad.  And that brings me to the service: almost always it is friendly and efficient, but rarely it can be unpleasant. (And of course that seems to happen when the food is off.) After a bad experience, I started sitting at the bar. The barkeep is knowledgeable and friendly. And, the one time he made a mistake on an order, he had it fixed immediately.(I know it\u2019s selfish of me, but I\u2019ll be sad when he graduates from law school).  Salads are fresh and well executed, but nothing extraordinary.  Desserts are meh. Have a second cocktail instead.  At least once every meal, jazz/pop standard comes on it makes me smile.",

Very creamy cheese served with fresh jam and fresh bread. For dinner, gotta go with a pasta dish. I've had their tortellini stuffed with lobster and it was incredible. I've also had their gnocchi and it was the best ice ever had. You can't go wrong with any of the desserts, if you have any room left!",

Our experience from start to finish was amazing!!  I can\u2019t eat much so I had the Pork Belly appetizer and it was AMAZING!!  My niece loves pasta so she had the linguini with meatballs and she let me try her meatballs and the sauce and they were so flavorful and melt in your mouth goodness it was outstanding!!  To top off the night when we got our check it came in a little black book that you could write anything you wanted in it!!  That is a brilliant idea!!  Our Server was amazing the food was amazing will be going to visit again for sure!!!!",
