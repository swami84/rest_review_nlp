Perhaps, it was because I ordered carryout that it tasted foul. But, should that matter? I was really disappointed to throw my money down the drain like that; the soup was $4.95.  I did like the Thai tea. It is very sweet and tasty. If you order it, put lots of ice in it or get it without ice and chill in the freezer before drinking.

Both of us were staying in DC for work for around two months, and a long way from home, wanted something easy but good. Curries for the friend, and Tom Yum for myself. By the fourth time, they knew our drinks order off by heart.  The staff were always incredibly friendly, welcoming, prompt, and above all, cook really damn good food. There was not a night where said friend and I went to Talay Thai and left disappointed. They were always a spot of warmth, familiarity, friendliness and comfort food on what were often long, cold DC nights. I've not left a Google review before, but this one is worth making an exception for. They're just a thai restaurant--a normal, real thai restaurant with real people cooking good thai food for a real fair price, and for what they are, and for what they meant to two travellers, they are worth a clear five stars.",

Then,  they went to get the manager who said\" we don't sell that kind of thing here\". What she should've said was, she didn't want to give it to me. Standing from my side of the bar I could see plastic cups and ice. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I would give zero stars if I could. People are losing the simplicity of being a human. Everything isn't about money, it's about respect and having a good heart. I should've left a tip just to be sarcastic.  #Whatgoesaroundcomesaround",

Talay Thai, in contrast, was rather quiet with only a few tables occupied. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken. That's the one thing common to all Thai restaurants, so it should be a reasonable choice. My impression of this dish is it's only about average, not outstanding, although the portion size is on the large side and satisfying. It's priced on the high side though. Aside from that, the service was good and the dining area and restroom seemed clean enough. Overall however, it's an average experience and I am sure you could do better in DC.",
