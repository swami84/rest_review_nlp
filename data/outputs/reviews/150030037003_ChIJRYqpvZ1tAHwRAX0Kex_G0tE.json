The hummus was so so compared to the restaurant\u2019s neighbor. The portion for my expensive lamb plate was disappointing. That said, the sauces were rich but pretty good. However, perhaps because of the richness of the food or oil or something, my little one and I both had sour stomachs the next day. Thankfully, my partner didn\u2019t eat dinner with us that night. He felt fine. So the food was a good change from all the fish but if you aren\u2019t fed up with the local fare, I would skip this place. Or try Merriman\u2019s next door. It\u2019s a bit more expensive, but you may enjoy the meal better. And you aren\u2019t likely to feel bad the next day.",

I love how they source their ingredients locally and everything is presented nicely but most importantly tastes amazing! I had the lamb shis, lamb was cooked to perfection and spiced nicely. The rosewater and watermelon refresher was definitely refreshing but not too sweet, which I personally prefer.  Imam biyaldi eggplants were spot on, cooked very well and the sauce and saffron rice that came with it were flavorful also.  I loved the kunefe. Less sweeter than I expected which is very nice. It had a nice blend of flavors and texture. I highly recommend this dessert if you\u2019re not familiar with it. It\u2019s both crunchy and gooey from the cheese at the same time. We hoped to have decaf coffee with it but our server let us know that they don\u2019t serve decaf. This was at dinner time so we tried to avoid the caffeine. It would be nice to have herbal/non-caffeinated warm drinks for people who can\u2019t have caffeine.  Service was attentive and great! We didn\u2019t have reservations but we were seated outdoors in like a bench/ bar? It was okay for the weather but might not be too pleasant in the heat so I suggest making a reservation in advance.  Overall, our dine in experience met and exceeded all expectations. Hope to come back soon.",

Inconsistent message to patrons.  The hostess is unhelpful and unable to provide meaningful information or answer questions. Caveat: The place is always full of customers and has a beautiful outdoor seating area.  *UPDATE* It took 2.5 weeks to be able to dine at Istanbul.  After several attempts to wait for a table by walk-in and being told they were not seating additional guests (at 6:50pm) for the remainder of the night we persevered and it certainly paid off.  Now we know why the wait! Josh was our server who knew the menu inside and out.  He provided detailed recommendations and great alternatives for drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Highly recommend you request to be seated in Josh\u2019s section! Food selection: Mezze appetizer was fabulous but is quite a bit of food for two. IZMIR KOFTE and HEARTY MUSAKKA were flavorful, fresh and hearty.  The protein is seasoned well and moist.  The saffron rice is neutral and pairs very well. The baclava is the best I\u2019ve had in some time and is my favorite dessert that I\u2019ve sampled around the world. Miguel was the food runner and delivered the food with care and attention to detail.  Very polite and courteous, Miguel is a great teammate. Sammy was on her game making sure our table was never crowded And our cups were always full. This will be a bit pricy for a meal, but it is unmatched in Hawaii and superior quality, specialized and immensely flavorful.  Strongly recommend the effort to dine for a special occasion and splurge!",

They had plenty of outdoor seating, with space between tables, to accommodate our COVID caution. Cocktail was ok, you can drink if you want but the food is the highlight. The babaganoush was roasty, but not deeply smoky, it had a lightness in the flavor. Similarly, the lentil soup wasn\u2019t gritty, and a spritz of lemon added delicious complexity to the flavor. The lamb chop was melt-in-your-mouth, covered in delicious herbs and spices.",

This is as close as one gets to authentic Turkish (some of the main dishes like Iskender Kebab, the lamb chops Pirzola, and Kunefe) outside of Turkey. I have lived in Turkey for about 1.5 years and one would be hard-pressed to find Turkish cuisine outside of the ubiquitous donor kebab.  While the price is high due several combinations of its location in Kaka'ako and the ingredients from either Turkey or local grass-fed meat. The plates being served doesn't feel they skim on ingredients and its true to form on what I consider a strong representative of Turkish cuisine in Hawaii.  The place seems to always be busy, so reservations are highly recommended. Service is pretty standard if they are completely busy, so have some Turkish tea and be patient.",

Now I am not a lamb lover because of the after taste and after having it, I didn\u2019t taste the aftertaste which was great.  We had baklava for dessert and that to me was the best part of my meal and the best baklava I have ever had.  I am from Toronto where cuisine is diverse and robust so it\u2019s a lot to compare to.",

Drinks are expensive like beer but it was from Germany and is very difficult to find in any local store/restaurant. Definitely think better to go for dinner than lunch but I\u2019m sure lunch is great too!  GET THE LAMB!! The first one listed at the land portion of the dinner menu. I never found lamb to be that great but this one had everyone\u2019s eyes pop out because of how good it was! Everyone agreed it was the best lamb they have ever had in their life. Literally like butter, melting in our mouth. Super tender and very flavorful.  I\u2019m a cheap 21 year old foodie and it\u2019s rare I am satisfied paying so much for food. Took my family here and all 5/5 of us were extremely satisfied with our food.",

Ambience.... good, with a few qualifiers:  So the place's design and decor was fantastic.  The general feeling was good and I really wanted to enjoy it, but the place echoes and amplifies noise.  Paired with that, there was a *really* noisy gal with a Fran Drescher laugh one table over.  What should have been an \"outstanding\" dining experience turned out to be only \"good\".  I had to lean in very close to the others at my table to be heard.  Understand the laughing lady is beyond staff control, but I would advise the store to take a look at the noise levels.  Understandably, there is a balance between energy and relaxation for every restaurant environment, but it definitely degraded our dining experience yesterday.",

I called to make a reservation and they let me sit on a bar next to the door (its somethig they should tell me in the phone if they dont have a table). Long waiting time for the food to come out. We were sitting 2 people and my husband got first his meal- pass 10 minutes till i got mine. The meals were really tasty- specially the musaka, but again really small amount for meal that cost 34$. Also the hummus and the babaganush really small amount for their price. The dessert was good. I ordered kunefe and i liked even though i tasted better - but for me it did the job. Ill definitely wont come back, sadly. I cane to celebrate my husband birthday and we came out in a really bad feeling. I hope that the restaurant will take my review as a way to get better that might other people enjoy and wont happen same thing that happen to us.",

It is super cool that they have a projector shows places from Turkey. I love the colors, ambiance, details and our waiter was very attentive. Definitely try all their mezes and desserts. My date had a meze platter and baklava and I had a pirzola, kunefe and lion's milk cocktail. Great date place, but be careful you may end up eating too much there. Everything was memorable.",

I love mezze platter which has variety of flavors like hummus, dolmas , water borek and more. I tried lamb and it was absolutely wonderful and melted in my mouth. Server was very attentive and ambiance was just simply wonderful. Drinks were so refreshing. Open kitchen, Turkish coffee cups, copper tray, handmade tables... Everything was great however I am very impressed about Covid-19 precautions. All the tables are spread out, entire staff members wear mask all the time, they clean and sanitize tables between customers. They allow certain amount people in their restaurant. Overall Istanbul restaurant is very clean and tasty!!! We will be back",

        "caption": "My wife and I love trying new places to eat, and this one has been on our radar for a few months ever since we noticed the sign pop up across the street from Whole Foods. We rarely get to eat foods from that region because Hawaii has a higher demand for Asian cuisine. We went for one of their soft opening days, and it happened to be the busiest day for them since their opening. I dont like to judge a place by their soft opening, but in this case, I feel confident that I understand their concept. We sat at the bar with the bar manager as our waiter and bartender. He was very busy, but took the time to introduce the food and wine to us. The wine menu was filled with Greek and Turkish wine that was a wonderful surprise. The menu was pretty straight forward, but is to be expected when first opening. We tried the appetizer platter, the turkish style \"ravioli\", and a kebab. The appetizers took quite a while to come out, but I'm not surprised because they were quite busy and everyone was learning how to work with each other in a new system. The food was DELICIOUS and the entrees came out in good time after our first round. We tried several glasses of wine each and the food paired quite well with the assortment of Mediterranean varietals. All in all I give this new restaurant 5 stars and two thumbs up for being a new restaurant in a quite fancy neighborhood. The prices were a bit high, but factoring in for convenience and ambiance, well worth it.",
