Obviously, we checked to see if the reviews were good.  After all, if you have a bad meal in New Orleans - it's your own dang fault.  I decided to have a salad, appetizer and a dessert.  The Duck Breast Salad was perfectly prepared and really tasty.  I was hoping it would be a good pairing with the Pinot Noir flight of wines that my wife ordered.  And it was.  The appetizer I went with was the New Orleans Barbeque Shrimp.  Again, I was really blown away with the flavors and the bread served for dipping and to cut the acidity of the barbeque sauce was really good.  I have to say the highlight of the meal was the French Vanilla & White Chocolate Bread Pudding.  I kid you not, this might be one of the best desserts I have had in years.  Going to Orleans Grapevine Wine Bar & Bistro made the rest of the places in the French Quarter a tough comparison.",

Having looked at reviews of several places we chose here because of the menu. Sitting outside in the courtyard, we were looking forward to a great experience. Our server seemed to be the only person there that was disinterested in being at work or answering menu questions. Everyone else seemed to be friendly. They brought out bread and butter to start which was fresh and hot. While neither of us are raw oyster eaters I have found fried oysters good on occasion but Diane never has been a fan so for some reason we ordered the Oysters Orleans, oyster cooked with asiago cheese and bacon. Feeling adventurous I guess. What a great choice. We wished we had ordered a full order instead of half. Diane then had the scallops small plate with mushroom wild rice and blackberry brandy reduction. The scallops were few but very good but the rice had a bit to much reduction sauce and was to runny. I had the Gulf Fish almandine made with drum. It just didn't work. The vegies were good but the fish was bland and the almandine sauce was just butter and almonds. Far from the quality I paid for. Half good half disappointing. I wanted to like it but I would definitely try someplace new next time.",

When we were seated I informed our waiter of my allergy and he told me to order meals with the small asterisk because they are gluten free. Let me start off by saying the selection is awesome and there are gluten free options in every category. I ordered the BBQ shrimp and asked the waiter to make sure the French bread is on the side. When the BBQ shrimp arrived the bowl was filled with tasty shrimp and FRENCH BREAD. I informed the waiter that they accidentally put bread in my shrimp and his response was \"are you so allergic that you can't eat it?\" I felt like I was being asked to take a light poisoning. I took the precaution of photographing my order prior to sending it back. Our main courses arrived a few minutes later and the waiter asked if I still wanted my BBQ shrimp. I said yes and they brought it right out. Trouble is they pulled the bread out and sent me the same shrimp. I told the waiter I didn't want it and explained that it was the same order and it would be poison for me. He then said they made it fresh for me and that it was a newly prepared order. I then showed him the photographs and he took it back. I then  went to the bathroom and my waiter walked in. We both felt a little awkward due to the attempted poisoning. It really must have bothered my waiter because he used the urinal and walked straight out without washing his hands!!! Little did I know but gluten was the least of my worries as urine was also on the menu. My double cut pork chop was delicious and well prepared. The fish Amandine was also amazing and the wine was amazing. With some gluten sensitivity training and some basic hygiene training this place will be a TEN but until the staff has a sign reminding them to wash hands before returning to work we are all at risk.",

My friend and I had to wait for a few minutes to be greeted but were taken to a table right away and told about the specials. I believe they told us that they didn\u2019t serve the full menu until around 6pm but that we were able to get drinks and appetizers. A huge plus for me is that they serve free bacon during happy hour. Who does that?!? They also serve warm baguettes with a spicy butter for the table to share. We both enjoyed the Pecans Praline drink. It was very sweet and something that I\u2019d never tried before. I will absolutely stop by this gem the next time I\u2019m in New Orleans.",

I let it go because it could have been a bad day.  Now, it is a pattern. Was there a change in ownership?  I had a 30 minute wait for an appetizer and it was not busy. No reason given why it was so late and not hot.  Server knew nothing about wine. The last trip, the server forgot to enter the order.  Then, brought the wrong food to our table. Three years ago we had one of the best servers in my life, the guy must have worked at Commanders. The food was great and we decided to keep coming back.  I will give it a few years to see if they can work out their issues. Hopefully, the kitchen staff stays.",

Asked if I could order something to go, waitress said yes, but ordering at the bar would be quicker. Went to the bar and bartender stated that they did not take to go orders at the restaurant. I said the waitress told me to order at the bar it would be faster. He made a show like he would check with the chef and the chef said no. Not sure what is different from preparing food to serve in the restaurant versus food to go. Could have just made me a regular plate and I could have boxed it myself. Guess they don't need business or good customer opinions. The rest of the family had already ordered or we would have all just walked out. So much for good old south Louisiana hospitality.",
