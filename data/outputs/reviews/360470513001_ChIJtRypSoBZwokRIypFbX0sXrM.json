This is not only the best Lebanese restaurant I have been to in the United States (and I've tried a lot) this is one of my favorite restaurants ever.  We started off our meal with the hummus. Fresh, flavorful, and served with unbelievably delicious bread and pita chips. Not your average hummus, it was incredible.  For entrees, we went with the falafel fried chicken and the Beirut style shawarma. The portions were HUGE, and can easily be shared. Beautiful presentation, delicious. Small Lebanese touches in there that I greatly appreciated.  We finished off our meal with the carrot cake, which was incredible. The vibe of the restaurant is colorful, stylish, and relaxing, the perfect for a date night, a group brunch/dinner, and everything in between.  There are very few restaurants that make me audibly say MMMM THIS IS AMAZING with every bite. I felt like I was having an out of body experience. I almost cried, really. PLEASE do yourself a favor and visit Magdalene, you won't regret it.",
