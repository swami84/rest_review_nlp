The flavors of this spinach pie were fantastic. The servings were so large i had leftovers. The next day when I reheated the calamarri it still tasted so fresh and good and I can still taste the wonderful flavor of the reheated spanakopita. I am so glad I tried Little Athens and I will definitely be back for more.",

We met Maria , the chef/owner who in addition to cuisine is also a pastry chef. She shared her passion for food as a child and by NO surprise her dream is a REALITY! We started with the hummus and fried zucchini balls followed by the grilled branzino and lamb chops that were WOW!  Being a huge foodie, I highly suggest the fish and lamb chops and might stick to the traditional specialties which i saw being praised over by local greek patrons which if the greeks are eating Greek, YOU KNOW IT'S SPOT ON! Prices were VERY FAIR and the portions were suitable to share! i Can't wait to go back and until than, I will be ordering TAKE OUT! Thank you Maria for a wonderful meal! Your passion for food is praised! OPA!!!!!!",

I had ordered the Spinich pie - spanakopita , and musaka which I had never heard of before because I usually think of Greek restaurants as mostly seafood dishes, but they have seafood dishes as well as other traditional dishes I haven't seen in many other Greek restaurants like the musaka which is like a casserole dish with eggplant and beef and all the yummy delicious things you can think of.
