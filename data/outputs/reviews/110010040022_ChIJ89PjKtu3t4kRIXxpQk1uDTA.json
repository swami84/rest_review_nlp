Not with the service, but with the food. I ordered a half a Peking duck (you know.. What they're named after), and literally got about a drumsticks worth of actual meat. The rest was pure fat and gristle.  And I really got the feeling that it was sitting in the back somewhere and was simply warmed up. I love duck, and it doesn't take much to satisfy me, but that was just awful.  Lastly, (and here's the offensive part) I ordered chicken fried basil rice. The rice would have been decent/good if it was mixed with chicken. Because.. THAT... Was not chicken. Nor was it pork, or seafood (although it had the consistency of bad calamari).  I tried to ignore the fact that the rice didn't even have any remnants of chicken flavor, but... I couldn't.  That was just gross.  I won't speculate as to what type of meat that was.... But I'm pretty sure whatever it was \"had\" whiskers. Honestly, I wouldn't even bother ordering an egg roll from there.  My experience was that bad.  Order from there at your own discretion.",

I just wanted to understand him and tell him my address for about he 3rd time but he couldn't get it right. I was cool about it and didn't think any ill of it.  Then I get my food about an hour and forty-five late, warm and the rice wasn't rice.  I had ordered fried rice but I got brown. Also to mention when I called in to check in on the hour. They was kissed at me for checking in.  So I called them back and told him he messed up my order, told him it was cold and I just want my fried rice delivered.  He had the never to tell me that he wasn't going to do it and got loud and disrespectful with me for stating a customer service error on  his end. After I got tired of the disresepect. I've told him that he shouldn't be talking with me because I was being civil and level head and talking to me like that isn't a good look.  He continued to talk very wreckers to the point that I wished I could of snatched him through the phone and smack him.  So now we found a solution... he said he could deliver it and guess what he said what had to be done to get my rice? A delivery fee.  Food cold, Arrived late and the order was messed up.  How am I the bad person in this situation?  So after I told him that wasn't an option and something has to be done. He then turns around and say. If I pull up the place it's now $5 flat to get some rice.  You F'n kidding me right?  WOW!  Food was aight 2.8/5 Service 0.3/5  Would I recommend another person to this place I've been getting from for over 2 years.  F no! Not a chance!  That be the last time you run your mouth in a disrespectful manner and think my services is needed. From your end it's really not but for me.  You just lost me.  Sincerely yours!
