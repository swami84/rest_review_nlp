When I attempted to go around the van the driver accelerated.  After turning onto Congress I pulled forward whereupon the driver became even more belligerent!  I inquired \"are you serious...you're calling me all these names when the name of the business is posted all over the van?\"  I guess it didn't matter at that point as the driver began making obscene gestures with his tongue.  Well, I guess the driver of the van, Illinois plate number ending in 1641 with the name of Boni Vino Restaurant plastered all over the van didn't care about what his employer would say when they see this review.",

To sit and wait roughly 15 minutes to be told they only have one order left. ( which I understand this happens) so I was given several choices to replace my original order. I had chosen mixed ravioli. Well my meat filled noodles were under cooked, and my sauce was very watery, not to mention that the cheese ravioli was just warm. I left a $6. Tip cash. To later check my balance only to find my bill was larger than what my charge was..... I was charged an extra $7.90 to my card. I DO NOT recommend!!!!!  By the looks of my receipt I was charged for a 20% tip. Even after leaving a 6% cash tip. The food nor the service warranted a $13.90 tip.",

We started with the fried cheese sticks with marinara sauce and chicken noodle soup that was perfectly seasoned.  Then went on to the main meal, grilled salmon salad with vinaigrette . . .YUM! The Husband had the Barbecue beef sandwich with fries.  He finished every bite, and I swear I saw him try to lick the plate!!!

The lasagna is the perfect balance of meat and cheese and the meatballs are not too large. The sauce is very full of tomato flavor and just a little sweet.

The special that drew me in was $5 slice including drink. Was not charged that when I asked about she said no sorry this is the price I\u2019m sitting next to window with sign it clearly says $5 it\u2019s not the price so much as the attitude and frankly the food wasn\u2019t worth $3 let alone $15. Very disappointed read the reviews before I ordered probably had their friends and family write reviews. No free refills $2 for a smal glass of coke that was mostly ice. Disappointed all the way around!!! Don\u2019t waste ur time or money!!!!",
