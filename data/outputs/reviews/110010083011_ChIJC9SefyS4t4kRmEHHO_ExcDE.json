I love the Avocado Toast and the lunch sandwiches, too. There is a fantastic mural on the side of the building from a lovely DC artist. I'm sure they re-stock the mac & cheese all the time thanks to me, too. They also have pre-made grain bowls & salads - great for dinner on the go. Other staples, pantry supplies, and household basics are there too. Love this place!!!!",

Powered by DC's beloved Union Kitchen, Union Kitchen Grocery is like a hipster/yuppie bodega. It's close to Union Station and comes complete with DC made products and organic and natural products. If you need some fresh produce or a package of Krave beef jerky, this is your place. They also carry DC local products like Compass Coffee and Honest Tea (started and run just outside of DC in Bethesda). They even have a section that sells basic necessities like cold medicine and more artsy goods like DC art and cards.  The best thing about Union Kitchen Grocery, is that it is a coffee shop too brewing the best of Compass Coffee. My latte was on par with DC favorites like Maketto and Peregrine and my fresh out of the oven giant chocolate chip cookie was the BEST I've had in DC. They have one area of bar seating by the window that seats 6 (or 4 comfortably). They offer free, strong wifi.  To add the icing on the cake, they also support my favorite DC politicians (like David Garber).",
