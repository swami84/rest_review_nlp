On one hand the food is markedly better (though not as good as its rival a few blocks north on Lexington near 122nd street - Pro Thai) but good enough as a local nearby alternative. They also have a good lunch special.  My only real complaint and why it loses key stars for me  is their whack male server!!!  He's poutty, unpleasant and has terrible customer server - he always gets something in my order wrong, and is very  indifferent and impolite to the customer. Given  that the business seems not to be doing so well during COVID - they would do well to get better front of house representation. I only take advantage of the decent lunch special when he is not there! Otherwise I walk a few extra blocks to Pro Thai!",

Staff are also super nice, and service is legit. The lunch deal is insane!! Full size soup/drink/entree for like 12 bucks! P.S. get the Shrimp Thai Fried rice -- you're welcome.",

Veggies are well cooked and generous in portioning. Some places be skimping on the broc and carrots - not the case here!  Keep in mind, no matter where you order pad thai from to-go, it will keep cooking in the container when you leave the restaurant! That being said, it was still well flavored and not totally glued up. Be careful when ordering pad thai to go for this reason. Ive been to some thai places and it turns into a sticky noodle blob by the time i get home.  The pineapple fried rice (veggies only, no egg) was delicious to me. Really liked it. Veggies still had texture (not over cooked).  The sring rolls were good too.  Id definitely eat here again.",

The guy who takes your order is not completely honest but, I will give him the benefit of the doubt and say it's a language barrier. I asked for an item and he clearly heard what I requested then brought something else when I told him that is was not what I asked for he made no attempt to resolve the situation but, instead said took the item away and said \"It's not refundable\" what am I buying a sweater ?   So your willing to lose a customer over a 6.99 item come on?  That's NOT good business. In addition he charged me for another item he clearly and enthusiastically stated came with the entree then stated it was part of lunch special although it was 8pm! Money is not an object for me when I eat out so I paid for it as it was on my bill. But, the lack of integrity and good customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. This place looks like a nice restaurant but, don't be fooled it's take OUT!",
