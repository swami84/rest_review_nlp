The portions are large and the food is filling.  Even though the plate lunch has a bad reputation of being unhealthy, at Korean BBQ places like this, you can make healthy choices.  I really like the fact that if you ask for no rice, they offer you an additional side.  The BBQ chicken spicy BBQ chicken here is very good.  Nice meaty portions with no fat dripping off and cooked with a good char to get that barbeque flavor really going.  Service was fast and friendly.  Prices were not bad for the portion they give you.  I do have to say that I prefer Pearl's over Yummy's overall.",
