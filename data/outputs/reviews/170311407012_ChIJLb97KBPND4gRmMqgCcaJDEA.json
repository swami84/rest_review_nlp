The caf\u00e9 de olla was some of the best I\u2019ve ever had! It was so flavorful without being too sweet. The service was warm and friendly; all employees were wearing masks and there was hand sanitizer by the door. Their menu had so many delicious sounding options, it\u2019s definitely worth a visit here. Can\u2019t wait to come back to try more!",

Their breakfast sandwiches are incredibly delicious. So far, I've had both the breakfast sandwich and the chorizo wrap/burrito. Absolutely mouth watering!  Their drink menu seems unlimited, varying from lattes, macchiatos, cappuccinos, and so forth.. I have only had their Rishi Teas (specifically the Guayusa Cacao), which let me tell you, I have been OBSESSING over all thanks to Omar's recommendation!  Most importantly, their customer service has been impeccable. Omar has been incredible since the first day I walked in. He is such a pleasure to talk to and has made each experience a delight. All of his recommendations have been spot on and if you're reluctant or unsure of what you want, he is more than happy to help you.  All in all, Dulce de Leche is 100% recommended. If I could give it 11/10 stars I would! Support your local, small family businesses!",

They also use abuelita chocolate in their choco-latte, which is an absolute game changer and hard to find in most cafes.  Those things alone were gonna keep me coming back but then hubby and I had their food. It is so delicious! I had the breakfast sandwich and he had today's special, Jerry's Chilaquiles, with chicken. Both were incredibly good and very satisfying. Definitely not your average cafe egg sandwich, I'll tell you that much. No, it's way better!  Come try them! Very friendly and sweet staff too. \u2764\ufe0f",
