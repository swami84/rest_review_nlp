I had a Server issue I'm not sure if she was new to service industry or what, but I specifically mentioned my Avacado allergy yes I know it's horrible. I order civeche and of course it comes with avocados and I asked luckily I asked when it was served and she responded \"oh yea it does\" no apology or even ask to exchange.  Then the dish I ask to have avacado removed comes and it's right next to avocados.  Needless to say her lack of care or effort to accommodate me the consumer has tarnished this restaurant for me and the michilada eh it was Ok at best. Better off going to many other Pilsen establishments that can cater and knows how to serve there customers. By the way it's hard to get anything less than a 3 star for me, but I honestly feel I wasted money on food brought to me that I could not eat.",

I asked for less ice because the drinks are watered down.. Waitress completely ignored us and kept forgetting about us. Food was mediocre at best. Only good thing was the bucket of pacifico which at this point even they couldn't mess this up. Oh yeah bring a bottle opener because the waitress won't bring that. Used a fork to open the beer and even then the fork broke. Stay away and save your money for a better venue. Even if I receive a free food coupon for this place I would throw it in the garbage because that's where this place belongs. Move this place to the north side where you can over charge and under serve. Does not belong in a place like Pilsen.  Stay away!!! Better restaurants in the neighborhood.",
