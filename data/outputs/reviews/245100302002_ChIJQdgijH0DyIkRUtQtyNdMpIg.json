I have not been to Little Italy for some time and was sad to hear Ciao Bella was closed and wanted to go to an authentic Italian restaurant for my husbands birthday. We were a party of 5 and placing the reservation was easy. The atmosphere is welcoming with beautiful artwork. The menu is small but that shows the food is made fresh and I enjoyed having a small selection. Food was delicious and large serving amount for both appetizers and entrees. The part that made our visit over the top was our waiter Anthony. We had questions to get recommendations and he was knowledgeable and passionate about the menu. He checked on us in a consistent way that was not overwhelming or invasive and we were happy to see him each time. I know this review cannot guarantee a raise but Anthony deserves an award or recognition for his amazing service. If anyone is looking for authentic Italian cuisine in a lovely and relaxing environment, this is the place for you.",

From the bread, to the pastas, Caesar dressing, raviolis, etc. The Caesar salad was delicious with their homemade dressing. The raviolis were phenomenal, albeit I had them made with Vodka sauce instead of cream sauce. Absolutely fantastic dinner. The wait staff all seemed knowledgeable, with my waiter Alex being friendly and on top of my excessive amount of water refills. Highly recommend.",

To my delight it was restaurant week in Baltimore and I had a 3 course dinner for a reasonable fixed price.   Their lasagna was delicious with in house homemade pasta. The cheesecake portion seemed small until I realized how rich it was. I felt pleasantly full afterwards.  I would like to go back to try some of the other entrees later.",

Even though they seem to specialize in sea food, I ordered a chicken dish and thought it was absolutely fantastic, and the bits of pasta I stole from my dining partners were really special in texture and taste. The bar area looks really swanky, but the main dining area a bit less so, so it's more about the food at this restaurant than atmosphere. One minor weak point, I thought, was the bread they served before the orders came out. They included two types. One type was great, but the other seemed surprisingly generic. But, it was easy to get over that quibble once the main courses arrived!",

We ordered the \"Chefs choice\". Chef Carlo came to the table and talked to is about what he direction he was going for our meal. He told us he was steering towards seafood based dishes as it was his specialty . I didn't consider myself a seafood guy. I like shrimp and crab but typically stay away from fish and never eat squid or scallops. Chef Carlo has changed my mind. I would now consider myself a GOOD seafood guy. Every course of our meal with exception of dessert was seafood based and absolutely delicious. I would order every one again. The Fritto Misto was a great start. The squid ink pasta was something that i would have never ordered prior but will now have a craving for. The Flounder was perfectly cooked. I honestly couldn't find ANYTHING that could have been done better. I give five stars because it won't let me give more.  Oh yeah and they have drinks with cool names like \"The Dude Abides\" which was a blueberry white Russian.",

The tiramisu was a delicious dessert, and the lasagna was excellent. Would recommend!",

It wasn\u2019t just about an impeccable service, or high quality/locally sourced cuisine, or creative and delightful pastries, but it\u2019s the entire package & overall dining experience that makes La Tavola stand out amongst peers.  Food: Simply outstanding. For this visit, we ordered Antipasto Italiano as a classic starter, followed up with three different types of entree (Spaghetti Neri al Granchio from the menu and two specials \u2013 lamb & seafood), then sampled two kinds of dessert (one from the menu and one special) to conclude a perfect family dinner. We shared all the dishes so everyone could taste a little bit of everything and provided his/her own comments. So what\u2019s the verdict? Essentially thumbs up from everyone and I would say that\u2019s a pretty rare scenario!  Service: Excellent. Wait staffs were friendly, professional and very knowledgeable of the menu & specials. GM was very attentive, walking around the floor constantly to ensure guests on every table were well taking care of.  Atmosphere: Comfortable space, soft lighting with non-intrusive background music, cast iron and wood deco around the dining area and painting on the brick wall together create inviting warmth, casual and relax ambiance and project sense of tradition.  Take away: Given the wonderful dining experience and value it provided, we plan to visit La Tavola again next time when we visit Baltimore.",

The food was absolutely delicious!  The meal was served family style (not sure if that's how the entire restaurant is or not) and every dish was better than the last.  The ravioli were by far my favorite but we also had chicken piccata, chicken marsala, calamari and a rolled eggplant appetizer - all of which were equally delicious.  The dessert options were just as good as the meal and the wine selection was top notch.  Service was fantastic and everyone was so polite and helpful.  If we're ever in Baltimore again we will he stopping by.  The parking situation was less than ideal but I think that was more due to the baseball game down the street than anything.",

The service was outstanding from the moment we arrived.  Our waiter took the time to go over the specials for he day as well as several dishes on the menu.  He had a way with words that made you want to order it all.  The Carpaccio was delicious and so light.  We also tried the soup of the day which actually was lacking a bit in flavor.  Everything else tasted wonderful after that.  The Gnocchi was light and melted in our mouths.  The Spaghetti Neri was a great and the crab meat really completes the dish.  My favorite item was the Linguini alla Scoglio with scallops, muscles, clams, shrimp and a spicy red sauce.  The pasta is all homemade which makes for a better dish as well as the fresh seafood.  Whatever you do, save room for dessert.  The cheesecake was okay but the cannoli was the star with that fresh creamy filling.  To top off he night, it was 1/2 price bottles of wine...winning!",

It was quiet when we came in, there were no other patrons.  (The weather was beautiful, the kind where one would expect people to be out and about OR to be at the beach!)  The interior gave out a warm (cozy) ambiance -- I personally loved the murals and earth-y color theme overall.  The server, Daniel, and \"unnamed busboy\" (I know, we should've asked for his name) were very cordial and accommodating.  The food (lunch) was great.  We ordered calamari and bruschetta for appetizers, and we weren't disappointed.  The calamari, especially, was thoughtfully served with veggie slices (nice touch!).  The entr\u00e9es - pasta dishes - were all served hot and brimming with just the right flavors we were expecting.  The portions were just right.  We had to decline their in-house desserts because we always go to Vaccaro's for Italian sweets.  We were told by \"unnamed busboy\" that La Tavola's cannoli was the best he's ever had.  (We have no reason to doubt him so we might try it at another time.)  It has been a delightful midday meal experience for us at La Tavola.  Highly recommended!",

The special salad with butter lettuce,arugula supposedly farm fresh was also bland. It was supposed to have pancetta but was served with some form of thinly sliced dry ham. The pears on it were thickly sliced but at least Sweet. My main meal was house linguini with seafood. The pasta was over cooked and the mussles were too shriveled and the few that weren\u2019t had a super strong Oder and taste so I did not eat them. The other seafood on it was ok. The white wine olive oil and garlic sauce I requested in place of tomato sauce was thick and yellowish and tasted like flour. The waitress said they did not have time to reduce so they add potato starch. Sacrilegious! Also asked for extra garlic and had no taste of it. The chef/owner wasn\u2019t there. If he was in the kitchen maybe it would have been different. I rarely complain but as a foodie and chef this was so disappointing. The staff was nice as an aside.",
