        "caption": "Handy little grocery store right near the New East Side/Streeterville hotels (Hyatt Regency, Swissotel, Radisson Blu, Fairmont, Sheraton).  My mom lives at 222 N Columbus and we spend a lot of time in the area as a result, so we've been going to Bockwinkel's for over 10 years.  Good selection of grab n' go sandwiches and 1-person meals, soup station, and a salad bar.  The salad bar is presently closed due to the Covid pandemic, but was always great before that. There is a limited number of both indoor and outdoor seating (weather permitting) for the lunch crowd who work at the nearby office buildings.  Standard small grocery items (but with an upscale twist) include a good selection of fruits and veggies, a small deli counter, general canned goods like soup, tuna, plus boxed goods such as ramen, pasta, rice, etc.  There is a whole wall of chips to choose from near the liquor department. There is a rotisserie oven where you can get precooked chickens, handy for a quick dinner or when making chicken salad. They have a decent selection of spices... most of the mainstays you might need. The frozen food options tend more exotic with a lot of great Thai and Indian foods, as well as more standard fare such as Mac n Cheese. High end ice cream brands include Talenti and Haagen Daz, but they have popsicles and ice cream sandwiches, too.  The good selection of dairy items in the cooler room includes both bottled and plastic containers of various milk products, a selection of high end yogurts but also standards such as Yoplait, and the usual selection of eggs, bacon, hard cheeses, Boursin and the like. They do not carry high end cheeses or olives... for that you will need to go around the corner and down the block to the much larger Mariano's Grocery store.  The small bakery counter carries okay french bread, some seeded breads, delicious full cakes, slices of cakes, and a few assorted deserts such as cupcakes, flan and fruit tarts, depending on the season.  They carry a good selection of crackers, chocolate and cookies in the aisles.  Excellent selection of wine, good beer options, and a surprisingly large choice of bottled water brands and types are available in the compact liquor department.  Dry goods are also available:  paper towels, tissues, toilet paper, toothbrushes and toothpaste, shampoo and conditioner, feminine protection, small tools and cooking items, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, storage containers, plastic cups, tape and scissors. They have various analgesics (Tylenol, Excedrin, Naproxen) as well. You get the idea.  \u2022For quick, easy and convenient, choose Bockwinkel's. It is perfect for last minute needs, forgotten items, 1 person meals, \"small shopping\", etc. They are also open much later (although hours have changed during Covid).  \u2022For \"regular\" grocery shopping, I'd go to Mariano's (a bit of a walk from here, but still convenient, especially if you have something to wheel groceries home in). The prices are a bit cheaper and you have a much bigger selection since they have a huge liquor department (*including a wine bar!), a terrific produce selection, a lovely selection of flowers and plants, a great cheese bar, fresh sushi (and a sit down table to eat it if you like), and a decent bakery.  However, it is farther to get to, is more crowded, and it can be hard to schlep all your groceries home.  \u2022For drugstore type items, I'd choose CVS for a better selection of hair care, feminine protection, makeup and drugs.  (1 block East, on Columbus AND another one 2 blocks West, down the hill on Michigan).",

I went to get my \"usual rave\" Turkey Chili (not pineapple chili like I mentioned before) and it didn't taste the same. I noticed the gritty texture and bland taste and sadly decided to take it back. I find the lady who served me and mentioned it didn't taste the same, she gets upset AND suggest we taste it together!!?? Then she goes to explain the chili is \"fresh\" because it's made in house. I say maybe someone missed an ingredient or something and her reply..... IT'S STRAIGHT FROM THE BAG INTO THE COOKER!!!! I'm no chef but I can guarantee chili in a bag IS NOT FRESH so it's possible it can taste different. I tell her that I will not continue to argue about chili and different taste buds and would like a refund. She said no but I can try another soup!!?? I asked for a manager and she was the manager (acting like that). Excuse me!!?? It's nothing posted regarding \"no refund policies\" and I know she's refusing because she's upset. Even after a customer heard the argument, she said \"just get your money back\", I explained she said I can't and she even looked confused. I googled to find a corporate office and only found other stores. I called another store to check if there was a refund policy and he mentioned it was at the managers discretion. I asked him for a corporate number and he said there wasn't but he can pass the message to the head individual, she's on maternity leave!!??? I removed this company from our vendor list and won't suggest any other company for catering since there's no way to hold them accountable.",

You should be ashamed of yourselves! Stop with the micromanaging and manage appropriately, respectfully and humble yourselves! Your business will not last long with this type of nonsense behavior!
