The broth was so rich and flavorful, I'm not sure if I enjoyed the wontons or the broth more! The calamari was cooked perfectly, the szechuan won ton sauce had a perfectly spicy chili sauce, and I finally was able to find delicious ma po tofu here. I always tell delivery drivers to leave my order at the entrance door of my building for their convenience, but my delivery person went the extra mile and delivered it to my apartment. He was so polite and nice!",

Since I did not have a great time this time around I decided not to tip but next time return to try something else and maybe it will be worth tipping. The short lady in glasses hit the glasses window hard as I walked out demanding I return. There were customers inside and already I was embarrassed. I walked back and she told me with a nasty look that I did not tip and I should tip. I told her I can\u2019t tip and that I don\u2019t want to put that on the card. She demanded I tip and I said well I will go get cash and bring it then. So I did and I returned. when I returned I told her what she did was embarrassing and not nice. I asked her had I been a White person would she had ran after me hit the window and motioned me to return? She was quiet and pretended not to understand. I added I did not tip because I did not like the soup and I don\u2019t have to tip it is not mandatory not and obligation. I added I ate twice before and I tipped and you were fine so if today I did not tip between $1.56 and $2.20 does that cause you to humiliate me the way you did? She said you will not be served here again we will not serve you when you come back. I said why? All because I did not tip you? She said you just tip in a sit down restaurant and I said I am not obligated to. All the other times i did tip so what changed today? I said here is your 20% tip $2.20 of the 10.99 meal. She pushed the money towards me telling me to take it in an angry voice. I turned and walked away. You will say this is not racial you will say this is that but I see and feel what I experienced and no one should be treated like that. Not a Black not a White nor anyone who decided not to tip. I will not be belittled, humiliated and made to feel this way by this restaurant again.",

        "caption": "South Side Ken Chinese Restaurant  Hyde Park desperately needed a non-Nicky\u2019s Chinese restaurant and it seems this is current solution to that problem. We came on a Tuesday evening with a huge group. They served us tea immediately, which was really comforting for a cold Chicago evening.  First impression is that they had a HUGE selection of dishes here: Sichuanese, dim sum, Cantonese, Americanized Chinese, and... Peking duck? I\u2019m always a bit nervous when a restaurant offers food from all over China rather than a specialized regional restaurant.  Since we were a big group, we got a bit of everything.  Warning: I\u2019m a hardcore Chinese food purist and is admittedly very snobby about authentic Chinese food.  Peking duck: This was probably the best thing we ate while we were here. It came with a bunch soft pillowy buns, cucumbers, and hoisin sauce. The price for this was really good, far cheaper than most restaurants that offer Peking duck. The meat was nice and fatty and tender. There was lots of flavour in the duck. The skin could be a bit crispier, but for the price it\u2019s worth it. If you come in a group, this is the perfect dish for sharing.  Sichuanese dishes: Jianjiaotudousi (Stir fried potato with bell peppers): probably the best vegetable dish we ordered. There was more peppers than I expected so the taste was more peppery but it added a nice crunch in comparison to the softer potatoes. It wasn\u2019t spicy, flavouring was fairly light but it still tasted good. Mapo tofu: Tofu was pretty nice and soft. We had to modify the order for the vegetarians to make it no-meat but I was surprised it came with peas and carrots? Was pretty disappointed I didn\u2019t taste any Sichuan peppercorn though. Instead, the sauce seemed to be more sweet and chilli taste. Should\u2019ve asked for it to be spicier. Yuxiang eggplant (Eggplant in brown sauce): Eggplant itself was good, fried to be soft and tender. But the sauce was quite oily. Since the sauce is supposed to be yuxiang, I wish I could taste more of the vinegar.  Americanized Chinese dishes: I don\u2019t normally order these type of dishes at Chinese restaurants so I have no idea how they compare to other restaurants'. For the crab rangoon, I liked this filling, the cream cheese flavour wasn\u2019t overpowering. The egg roll filling was pretty meh. Both the rangoon and egg roll were deep fried, maybe for a bit too long, to a brown colour and a very crispy exterior.  Dim sum dishes: Xiaolongbao (soup dumplings): These were pretty standard soup dumplings, the filling had a good pork flavour and the dough was nice and thin. Wish they had more of the soup in the dumpling but I thought it was pretty good otherwise. Shengjianbao (pan fried bun/dumpling): First time seeing shengjianbao that\u2019s pan fried on both side. The bun was sweet, which I didn\u2019t expect at all. I might be just ignorant here because I've only eaten the street food version of shengjianbao and not as a dim sum dish. Filling was alright. Vegetable dumpling: The dumplings are essentially steamed potstickers. I wasn't a fan of these unfortunately. Both the filling and wrapper were kinda mushy, but it had been sitting out for a while when I tried it so it might\u2019ve been better if I tried it fresh.  If you come here, get the Peking duck, and Cantonese dishes, since I think the owner and workers are from the Canton region. I found their Sichuanese dishes to be a bit off though, but maybe we didn\u2019t order the right dishes. If you have a Chinese food craving and don\u2019t want to leave Hyde Park, this is the restaurant for you. The prices are very decent for the portion size. Overall, I think this restaurant is a good addition to Hyde Park\u2019s gastronomy scene. However if you want truly authentic Chinese food you\u2019ll have better luck in Chinatown or Bridgeport.",
