The wings are overcooked and dry? The board of health needs to make a thorough inspection and the the Wing Stop Franchise should do a thorough follow up. Because the company must have a low bar for quality. Now about that overall score. Anyone below four stars is a risk. Below three is a no. This Wing Stop is simply not a safe choice.",
