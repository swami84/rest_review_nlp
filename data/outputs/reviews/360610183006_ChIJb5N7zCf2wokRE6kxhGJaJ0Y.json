It tasted like they pre-make all the food and then just zap it in a microwave.  The noodles were super soggy, the egg drop soup was slimy, and the vegetables in the fried rice were still cold.  Nothing was good about our meal and it was super expensive.  The waitress walked back and forth our table as if she was had nothing better to do than watch us.  It was uncomfortable! We literally ate nothing and walked out of there with an 80 dollar tab.  I don\u2019t want anyone else to experience this.  This is the greatest city in the world and we were extremely disappointed with this place. How could a place like this even exist in New York City??",

Entree was delayed until I had gone through everything else, but the soup, roll, and salad came at the same time. Good choice. I could sample all three and go back and forth. I asked for the Tom Yum and Sauteed Basil extra spicy, and they didnt disappoint. Everything was timed right, hot, flavorful, and fresh.  Waitress was typical NYC - pragmatic and with an economy of words, but smiled and was attentive as well. Best of both worlds.  For $7.50, the entree and salad would have been a perfect amount, no doubt. I'm having some sinus issues with the temperature here going from 4\u00b0 last week to 65\u00b0 today, so I really wanted the soup. I wish they had a larger version of the Tom Yum - I would have gotten that instead of the lunch. I'm glad I got all of it, though. There were choices of Chinese lunch fare for $6.95, I believe, and a choice of 2 or 3 sushi rolls for $8-11, and bento type lunch boxes for lunch as well. Hard to go wrong here at lunch.  Dinner will be the next trip to see if the service, quality, and the cost to portion ratio keep up.  Lunch was $17.35 with tax - $21 with tip. On a normal day, I probably would have skipped the roll (not because it wasn't good) and had either the soup *or* the lunch special, making lunch with tax *and* tip between $7 and $10 *out the door.* I can't really do that at McDonalds anymore.

Then we received our salads which can complain, once again sauce was amazing. Then we ate the entree I choose Pad Thai and well it was good but it was too over welling for me on the taste because I was expecting more of a peanut flavor sauce but it was more acid then I usually have had. Someone else got sushi, California and avocado roll which were delicious as told. Then for dessert we got green tea ice cream which was okay. Only thing would be that the service wasn't that great.",

Then go to Ozen, a fusion of three of the most popular Asian cuisines in town. Oh and they even have Vietnamese special, if you haven\u2019t tried one. So, sit down inside and feel the nice Asian atmosphere that will make you decide what to get. My sister took me and our parents to this place one evening. We just took the subway and walked from 96 Broadway to the next block. Of course, the food is great. No doubt about that.  That\u2019s already a given but the price is even amazing. They are very reasonable and affordable to average people. The thing that really impressed me the most is the beautiful place. It\u2019s like fine dining. The lighting is cozy and food presentation is really awesome. I really urge you to see it. It was really a nice treat my sister did for us. We even took pictures of the food. It was one of my memorable moments in New York City and I\u2019m sure it will satisfy your Asian taste.",

There was such an awful taste to them that I couldn't even eat more than a few! It was extremely disappointing and quite disgusting to say the least. Otherwise, I order exclusively from the Spa Cuisine section, which is standard, but quite tasty with the white garlic sauce. My boyfriend has ordered a lot of their Chinese dishes, like the chicken and broccoli, and has never had a bad thing to say.",
