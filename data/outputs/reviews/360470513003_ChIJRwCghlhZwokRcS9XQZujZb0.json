Upon arrival-Guacamole was all very brown and UNEDIBLE. The tacos were in a food box--upon opening looked like they were all shook around and it was just 1 big mess of lettuce and meat on 1 side of the box and the tortillas on the other. It no longer resembled tacos at all. Called the restaurant, asked for a mangager. Was told no manager. I informed them of my problems. They told me there was nothing they could do and to contact Seamless.  I can't believe this is the customer support that happens.  This is terrible service.  My food is completely unedible and all messed up.  They should send another order.",

Our waiter took our order and it took 50 mins for the food to arrive. Then the waiter disappeared for 30 mins in the bathroom. The bartender was on her phone so I had to stand up and walk across the restaurant to ask her for another drink. When the waiter came out he walked right past us (didnt ask how our food was, didnt notice we were finished) and went on his phone. I had to ask again can we get our check?! Awful!!! LAZY. Also, the food was bland. This place has never heard of SALT. Worst place EVER!",

When they were ready, I received various finger points, guiding a waitress. I tried a few peppers, but realised they weren't that great - I questioned why I ever ordered this then realised that I hadn't; I'd ordered deep-fried peppers yet received grilled peppers.  I called the kitchen runner who proved useless and grabbed the phone waitress who played dumb and tried making out that my order was still valid. She offered some sort of alternative, but how could I trust them any more?  I'd say don't go, but I don't need to - even if you do turn up, you be hard pressed even finding the waitress and ordering a drink.",

The Venezuelan bartender mixed a delicious margarita for myself and sweet looking strawberry margaritas for my friends. We did not eat but the food our neighbors ordered looked delicious. The crowd was friendly, the game was close and positive vibes abounded. This is a great place that I hope survives for a long time! Come support and enjoy",

The guy who does the tarot readings is so cool, and he spends like a good 10 minutes giving you a thorough reading! Im not like normally a believer in tarot, but after a few drinks its soooo much fun to have the reading done. And they are surprisingly accurate....ahahaha. Love santos anne!",
