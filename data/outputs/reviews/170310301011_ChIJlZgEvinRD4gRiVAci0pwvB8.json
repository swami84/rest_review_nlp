I ordered delivery and was very impressed with how well everything was packaged. All of the rolls and cooked appetizers were fresh, delicious, and filling! I loved that the flavors of the ingredients are the stars, instead of overwhelming spice and salt. My bf and I especially appreciate Indie after trying several different places in the area that are too salty, too heavy, and too expensive for what they offer. Thank you, Indie! I strongly recommend you contact the restaurant directly for delivery because the service was stellar and the order took half the time it would usually take with GH.The delivery gentleman was very polite and arrived within an hour of my order placed. Can't wait to order again!",

I had the V- Temp (Sweet Potato & Asparagus) I don't know what they do but it taste so crunchy and light. Also ordered the Fire Komodo Maki (soft Shell crab, cream cheese, cucumber topped with broiled eel) Everything just taste so good together. Last and not least I also had the Santa Fe Maki (shrimp Tempura, cucumber, lettuce,  spicy mayo & Avocado) Perfect for a 1 bite! Seriously, Recommend to try this place if your in the Edgewater area.",

Ordered about 75 in sushi and a bottle of wine. The server never checked on us and we would have bought a second bottle. Second visit I left the tab open, ordered about the same amount and had to ask for them to wipe the table outside. The server came out and barely brushed it off with a paper towel. Again, they never came out to check on us. When we closed out I could only justify a 10% tip. It pains me not to tip at least 20% when I dine out. Oh and guess what? We were the only customers. The reason for four stars is the service. Would love to give them 5. With that said we will be back, but we will bring wet wipes and ask them to check on us.",

And I liked it, it was pretty yummy! They bring it out very nicely plated which is a plus as it is pleasing to the eyes and also tastes delish! We also got the crab rangoons which were also delicious! And the fried rice that was also delicious. Nothing bad to say here, definitely a must try if you don\u2019t fancy sushi!",

Having said that,  it was a pretty terrible impression by the waitress the first and only time I've actually eaten at the restaurant.   We walk in as the only customers there asking to sit on the patio and she asks,  \"You want to sit outside now?\"  We respond with a \"yes\" not grasping her skepticism.   She then says,  \"It's too cold.  I'll sit you by the window.\"  It was a sunny day in the mid 50s and didn't expect her to sit out there with us.  As a former server,  it was a rude way of addressing the situation and her demeanor didn't get better.  In conclusion,  I think it's a fine establishment.  I'll just be sticking to delivery from here on.",

We also order a curry and a maki roll. We sat there talking and drinking and eating. I saw my maki roll sitting by the sushi bar ok soon it will be here 7 minutes later I saw two people standing right by it doing stuff plus customers passing by to use the restroom at least 3 or 4. Then is almost 20 minutes waiting and we started to wonder why we do not have our food. The server comes over and tell us the maki roll is ready but the curry is not do you want your food. I said no, that food has been sitting there for a long time with a few of you breathing on my food, that is nasty.  She gave me a look like I asked to kiss my shoes. She said she can get me a new one. No idea if I got a new one or not i never saw them making a new one. The curry came almost 5 or 7 minutes later by now is 30 minutes waiting for our main dishes. Ok Sex on the moon maki roll was bad, omg tasteless, nothing good about it. However,  the curry was coconut milk red curry with fried chicken OMG  so good. That was the only thing it was worthy of our meal. Would I try again yes. But only take out, all the servers are so careless, almost rude. Nice place with funky wall art.",

Turns out they use a big leaf of Japanese mint! Very delicious. Overall, the bowl was great, the ambience was nice. It's perfect local for date or just for relaxed lunch with friends. I will definitely eat here again! Also, they provided you with chopsticks and forks so no need to worry if one is not proficient with the chopsticks.",

The sushi was uninspiring, the wonton was almost burnt to an inedible scolding mess in my mouth, and the service was consistently absent.  I felt like I wasn't even welcome there with the awkward wait and seating.  And there were several tables that were \"reserved\" next to the windows that never showed up.  The server never asked us how we were or seemed to care that we were there.  The place was barely 1/3 full even by 6:30pm when we left.  So how is there any excuse for such absent and flaky service?  As far as the food, I was warned when I ordered the Kimono roll, that it would be REALLY spicy.  Really?  Spicy?  Spicy Nacho Doritos have tasted spicier.  It was bland, unexciting and fell apart often.  You may try to put on a trendy facade, Indie Cafe, but you didn't follow through with any positive experience.  Making your food look fancy and serving alcohol with the option of BYOB just doesn't cut it.  For those with the need for a gimmicky place to eat, here you go.",

        "caption": "Chef Iggy Waranon and Co-Owner Gui Prasartkul came to Chicago in 1998 with intent to study art. With the help of their roommate and friend, they developed a menu with a fusion of Thai and Japanese cuisine inspired by their passion for art. The combination of Iggy\u2019s cooking experience and Gui\u2019s business acumen, the Indie Caf\u00e9 emerged in 2004. Ever since, Indie has opened, it has become an original Chicago restaurant. The logo shows much of what Indie is about. The logo is an octopus which its legs represents the diverse influences and techniques brought to the cooking. The cuisine of Thai and Japanese is presented in an elegant artistic matter. They stretch boundaries to develop dishes without changing the roots of both cuisines. Its interior design is surely a sight to see, from the comfortable black lounge seats to the colorful paintings on the wall. It seems to me that they put just as much thought into the d\u00e9cor as the menu. The first time you step in you can see the sushi chef preparing food in the middle of the room. It is very colorful and has a nice window view of the street of Broadway. They hang paintings up on the wall that all share a similar style, but don\u2019t look too long. The art is very different and can cause you to stare at it for a while. They have unique lightings, which looks like woven circular silk shades that illuminate the room. The dishes that the food comes out in are plain white square plates, in order to keep the consumer\u2019s eye more focused on the art of the food. Many people walk in, mostly families or couples. Everyone that walks in is very friendly and has already come once before. Indie has many regular customers around the neighborhood. Indie Caf\u00e9 lies between Western, Irving Park, June Wayne, and Lakeshore. The restaurant can be accessed by CTA. In between Thorndale and Grandville of the Red-line is found right around the corners. It is convenient for many Chicagoans to get to, and at any time you want. The restaurant is open from 11am to 10pm, except on Tuesday. The menu in Indie is absolutely huge. The menu is very unique and you will not find it anywhere else. From the appetizers to the desserts you will enjoy almost if not all the food listed on there. There is also a wine and beer menu just as large as their food menu.  The portions are not large but definitely worth the price. The dishes always come out with a wow factor. They arrange to plate in a way that you much rather stare at it than eat it. The food satisfies your taste as well as your sight. The dishes are made well, and are not rushed. I feel that with the way the food looks and taste they should raise their prices. Did I also mention they have a catering and delivery service? The waitresses are very friendly and always have a smile on their faces. The employees make sure that your experience there is the best and that you come back for more. In conclusion, if you want a nice restaurant to have a family dinner or a simple date that is wallet friendly, I one hundred percent recommend that anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine and/or art. The food is amazing for its somewhat cheap prices. The service they offer is absolutely the best. If you live around the neighborhood they could just deliver their awesome food to your door step or cater at your next party! How many fusion restaurants do you know that have a catering business? This is truly a one of a kind restaurant found in Chicago.",
