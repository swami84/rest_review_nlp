You order your food and sit down and upon doing so you start to read the various letters and artifacts scattered through out the wall. You learn that this shop opened in 1976 by two European immigrants who have been serving the surrounding community ever since. That's when the lady calls out to you that your food is ready and you make the connection. Andja Branko hands you your food. Not just do you receive perfectly cooked, delicious homemade food but you receive a heart-warming, delightful conversation with the owner herself. You walk out with a special feeling in your heart, realizing the tenderness of your experience. Places like these are hard to find, cherish them.",
