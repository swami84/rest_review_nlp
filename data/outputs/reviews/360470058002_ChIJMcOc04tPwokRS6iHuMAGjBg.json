I went at a non-busy time, the restaurant wasn't packed on a Friday night. Waited 3 hours for my orders. An additional 20 minute for the check. The food didn't taste like it was made from the hand of God so it wasn't worth the 3 hour wait. Why did I wait 3 hours? One of my friends really wanted to try it. Take my warning and run. Manhattan priced sushi that doesn't deserve it.  That will be the last time I'm there.",
