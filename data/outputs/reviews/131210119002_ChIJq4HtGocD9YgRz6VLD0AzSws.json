Also, he was on a bike and not in a car. Never called to let me know. Finally, after 1.5 hours I received my sandwich and very stale cookie. No apology, no phone call - just a note on the receipt that read \u201cDelay\u201d The only reason I gave them 2 Stars was because my order was correct.

As I sat there I noticed the music playing in the background was using very vulgar language. Not sure if that's the image that Jimmy John's wants to promote. All about having fun and great music playing but need to make sure that the music choices aren't using language that can make your patrons feel uncomfortable.  Thanks!",
