So when she was in town I suggested we go there for dinner. Although it was a Monday, the restaurant was completely empty at 7:00 PM. I was beside myself! I cut Shula's some slack because it was right after Thanksgiving weekend. We sat at a very nice table. The wine by the glass list is extremely generic. Do they have a reserve wine list? We weren't presented one. I am a sommelier by profession and would have appreciated better wine than what I can find at Publix or even CVS. The menus were stained and some pages had tears in them. It was sad. That and the fact that the restaurant was dead should have been our signals to turn around and go somewhere else. We split a 16 oz NY Strip, potatoes au gratin, and brussel sprouts. The steak was cooked properly (medium rare), but it was flavorless and it wasn't juicy. Also - $48 for ANGUS BEEF?? Are you kidding me?! That is outrageous, especially for a mediocre steak. The potatoes au gratin were horrible. Undercooked, grainy in texture, and drowned in a lukewarm cheese sauce. We should have sent it back. Also very overpriced for $11. We each had just one bite and that was all we could handle. The brussel sprouts were good, but for $10 they should be the best I've ever had and they were far from that. The last time I ate here was in 2013 and it was incredible. The restaurant was full, the atmosphere was vibrant, and the food was delicious. I really can't believe Shula's is still in business. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because Neal provided very good service. My mother has always asked for him over the years and he is very friendly and professional. But this time my mother and I agreed we will not go back to Shula's again.",

We started with the appetizers. The Calamari was not bad at all, call it a 7 out of 10. It was cook well, seemed like good quality.  The crab cake was another story. It was priced and presented like fine dining. By that I mean, one crab cake for $20. Again, this is expected but what wasn\u2019t expected was the taste and quality. Not sure how it was made specifically but my guess is frozen crab parts mixed with a stouffers type store bought stuffing and a foul mixture of seasonings.  Then the meal came, we all had the \u2018mixed grill\u2019 for variety.  Where to I begin with this $45 monstrosity. It was presented fine dining, by that I mean small portions, too hot plate (normal for fine dining and always stupid. Please stop doing that fine restaurants, please.) and of course the price, minus the sides.  I had the Filet Medallions, Maui Maui and BBQ Shrimp.  The beef seemed like Grade B meat. It was worse than what I would expect on an airplane, couch class. It was cooked perfectly at medium rare but was dry and tasteless.  Actually there was a bit of taste but I\u2019m being kind omitting that in my original description.  Had I had this steak on the Golden Corral Buffett I would have been disappointed.  The Maui Maui was crazy small, maybe 2-3 oz which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It tasted like it was microwaved.  But the true disgrace of the show was the BBQ Shrimp. I appeared to be a medium quality frozen bacon wrapped shrimp literally dipped in a store bought BBQ sauce. And I\u2019m not even talking like a Stubbs level sauce. This was like a can of BBQ sauce from the discount bin. Never seen canned BBQ sauce? Me either but now I\u2019m convince it must exist.  The sides, which all cost extra of course, where thoughtless low quality fairs.  I don\u2019t want to complain on the people. We had good service and were treated as expected. And honesty, I think everything was actually cooked as well as it could be. It was just super low quality stuff.  And I\u2019m not talking low quality for fine dining. I\u2019m talking low quality period. I can easily do better at 2am with the munchies throwing stuff together from my refrigerators, about to expire selection.  Just avoid this place unless you hate your money and more importantly hate yourself and those you\u2019re with.",

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was nice and open and modern. It had several different types of seatings from comfortable high tops to smaller tables with comfortable large chairs. Since I had really eaten a lot the night before, I decided to take a break and ordered the Club Shula Sandwich with steak fries (don't judge me).  The club and the fries were both really good. The club consisted of ham, maple glazed turkey, smoked bacon and cheddar served on ciabatta bread. It was delicious. The bacon was particularly well done. It was crispy without being burned the way bacon should be. The steak fries were also superior. Lately, the fries I have been getting from restaurants tend to be too thick, taste more like potatoes and are often undercooked. None of this was an issue with Shula's steak fries. They were perfectly cooked and had just the right combination of thickness and crunchiness. I put the fries out on the table so everyone could have some and they didn't last long.  Overall, I was very happy with Shula's. For a chain the food and setting were both very good and I would easily recommend this place to others.",

Good but just plain old mashed potatoes. Again a bit bland. Asparagus as cooked perfectly and the best thing about the dinner. Dinner came with chocolate cake which was great.

This location is located within a hotel, I don\u2019t know if all locations are like that but I will get to the reason I am mentioning this further in my post. The meat was terrible, way over cooked and the service was not the best, perhaps because we were the only ones there as what appeared to be a very bad day for the restaurant. At the end we get our bill and we were force to pay a tip that was indicated on the bill that is normally added to those who stay at the hotel.  Since we were not staying at the hotel I argued this,  then we were told that because we used a promotional price that was the requirement. Promotional price or not your management should be a shamed of doing that to a customer. Do not advertise promotions if you are going to hit a customer with an obscene tip amount. In any case if you are undecided you can go ahead and pass on this place as I have had better steak than that.  Certainly not worth the price and the meat that was presented at the entrance was not at all what I got on my plate.",

Our server Ali was especially thoughtful and I\u2019m glad we had the pleasure of his service. We had the cowboy ribeye and the filet mignon trio, crab Mac n cheese, potato gratin and ceasar salad. All solid food.  My only complaint is that it is incredibly unoriginal and will charge $10 for a generic ceasar salad and $10 for steamed asparagus. I get the shareable concept but that\u2019s absurd. For $200 a meal for two I\u2019d expect to be at a chefs table trying gelled and foamed experiments, not classic meat and veggies. Also, I\u2019ve paid less for a better view. I would have expected this place to be atop the building encased by windows and city views.  The place was established in 1990s and in my opinion, stuck there. There is something to be said for tried and true, however, and this place does not disappoint if you wanna over splurge on simple good food.",

It was very tender and definitely aged, but I have to admit that I prefer dry aging to wet aging. The sides were well seasoned and very good, with the exception of the mashed potatoes. The quantity is definitely a lot for one person, and they arrived just at the lowest temperature that I would consider to be safe for serving hot food, which meant that by the end they were cold and had the consistency of paste. Also, I would have been fine with lowering the item cost and cutting the portion size for that particular item. For dessert, there is not much selection for someone with a gluten allergy aside from the wide variety of items from the bar, so I went with the ice cream. Again the portion was quite large for one person, so proportionally cutting back on cost and size would have been appreciated. Overall, the best parts of the meal were the conversation about the aging process and the side of sauteed mushrooms. I do my own dry aging thanks to a very high-tech kitchen, so even though on objective qualities the steak was perfect dry aging has a much more beefy flavor.",

I arrived at approx 11:20 am on  a Sunday (They closed for breakfast at 11:30) and were kind enough to squeeze me in. Unfortunately for another guests who came less than 2 minutes behind me, the hostess wasn't so accommodating. I for one think it's rather bad business to turn away money and close up early but hey.  So my order arrives, a Belgian waffles with a side of berries and bacon . I noticed the blueberries were cooked in the waffle and there were no strawberries which was not was not what I wanted but I shrugged it off thinking it couldn't be that bad .  The waiter realized this error and  brought back my berries on the side.  It was then, when I actually cut into the waffle, that i realized ALL l the berries had been cooked inside the waffle,  and the waffle itself half cooked.  To their credit, it was taken off with no apology and rather dismissively. The overall service left a genuinely bad taste in my mouth.... almost as bad as the waffle. Oh I did get free berries also and the primary waiter was pretty nice",

        "caption": "Shula's is self described as a \"Celebration of the '72 Dolphins undefeated season.\" when the reality is more akin to the winless seasons of '76 Bucaneers or '08 Lions.  When paying a premium for a meal, in particularly at a restaurant that prices itself as a \"high-end\" restaurant I believe it is fair to expect a certain degree of service and food quality. Unfortunately I found both to be lacking.  My party attended Shula's for Christmas Eve Dinner and consisted of seven adults and four children. Our reservation was for a private dining room and the restaurant was perhaps 1/3 full.  To begin with, perhaps our server was new, which would seem odd to let him handle a private party solo, but it is the only explanation I can conceive of at this moment for the service or lack thereof. Apart from smelling like a smokestack and disappearing for long periods of time (I can only assume smoke breaks) he somehow managed to bring a soft drink to a guest who arrived fifteen minutes after everyone else but somehow neglected to bring drinks that had been ordered by the rest of the party upon their arrival.  The next adventures occurred when the entrees were served. Despite being a private party, in a private dining room in a 1/3 full restaurant, a meal went missing. Somehow the wait staff had taken the order of one of our party and sent it to another table in the main restaurant.  This error was rapidly followed by an additional faux pas. A different member of the party had ordered a steak well done. Now while I may take umbrage with ruining a good steak in this manner, nonetheless, the temperature requested was well done. The steak arrived and it was medium rare and promptly sent back. Not even close to well done. Five minutes later they bring the steak out and it didn't look different at all. At this point in time it wouldn't have surprised me if they had tried to microwave it...I as that surprised by the incompetence.  I personally ordered a medium-rare New York Strip which was cooked correctly but the quality was more in line with Outback or Appelebee's as opposed to a good steakhouse.  I do want to give credit where credit is due. The sides were good: Seared Ahi Tuna, Sourdough Bread, Green Beans and Steak Fries (huge basket) were what I would expect based on the cost of the meal.  Ultimately, if you are looking for a real steakhouse and a good dining experiencing I strongly suggest Bern's, Charley's or any high end steakhouse that is NOT Shula's.",
