We were seated at our table which had no place settings and was served water immediately, shortly after, our waiter took drink orders. It took quite some time to be served our drinks since the room was starting to fill up with other diners.  We had a limited menu to order from which is understandable on an anticipated busy night.  Once we were served, we had no butter or sour cream on the table for anyone's baked potatoes, no salt and pepper and one meal of pork chops was served completely raw inside. The pork was sent back, and other meals had steamed veggies that were more raw than steamed. It appeared for whatever reason the place was understaffed.  Our waiter did try to take care of us but appeared as if he was being rushed. The manager comped the one meal that was sent back. We were disappointed in this visit as it was the 1st time most of us have been here. We are understanding enough to give them another chance for another visit on an evening with no special events.",

It was very apparent that the bar and kitchen were overwhelmed. It took about half an hour to get a drink order filled and after a while I just gave up on ordering more cocktails and stuck with water because it seemed pointless. After an hour and a half at our table we finally received our entrees. That's when things went from bad to worse. Mine and my husband's filets were cooked rare when we ordered medium well. No way were we going to send it back because who knows when we'd get a replacement. We just ate around the edges of our $25 steaks along with the extremely salty sauce and luke-warm potatoes and broccoli. Everyone at our table who ordered the baked potato received no toppings or condiments until they were finished with the luke-warm spuds. Worst of all was the person at our table who was served nearly raw pork. We skipped dessert in favor of ice cream at home. It seemed the safer option. All things considered we spent $100 on a very mediocre meal for two.",

But this could have been handled differently by management. We have been to other restaurants that have no problem.",
