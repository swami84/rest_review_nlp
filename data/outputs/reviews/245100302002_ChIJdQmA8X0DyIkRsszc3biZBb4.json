Today I ordered carryout since I totally dropped the ball for my husband's birthday (that he had to remind me about). I ordered the rigatoni alla vodka (for my 9 year old), orechiette for me, and fettuccini and lobster for my husband. I also ordered a caesar salad, the beet salad, meatballs and garlic bread. For dessert, I ordered a cannoli and the chocolate mousse. I didn't realize how big the caesar would be. We will be eating the beet salad another day as the caesar was enough for all 3 of us. Really loved the tang of the dressing. Can't stand when the dressing is super heavy. Everyone really loved their dishes and we each had a meatball. They give you a ton of food. My husband ate all of his (didn't even share!) and our son and I both have food left over. The mousse is really rich so I recommend having a glass of milk (what my son did) or chai tea (what I did) with it. It was so decadent! The cannoli was really good too. Had to steal it away from my husband so my son and I could take a bite. I also bought a bottle of chianti and the housemade limoncello. It was a dry chianti recommended by the bartender since the one I initially ordered was sold out. We didn't really drink the limoncello because there were so many other flavors with the meal so that will have to wait for another day. The wine was well received.  It was super easy to order over the phone. I was able to choose a time for pick up. Though I'm not quite comfortable with eating indoors yet, I do love ordering from my favorite restaurants! They were super friendly and helpful over the phone and in person. I will definitely order from them again.",

As soon as my friend and I walked into the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed with true sincerity. Our servers Eugene, and server in training, Joe, were attentive, sociable, and knowledgable while guiding us through the courses. The food was \"buonissimo,\" without the need for improvement! The complimentary plates and drinks from the owner were delightfully unexpected and gratefully consumed. While the food (especially the meatballs and limoncello) were amazing, the experience of the dinner really left a favorable impression. My only suggestion is that the wine could be more reasonably priced.",

We had reservations, so there was no wait. The host directed us to wait for a minute to be sat at our table, while that was happening the nice gentleman at the coat check, checked our coats and then we were seated! (So super fancy)  I don't drink, so I started with a sparkling water, and a surprise to me I was served the whole bottle throughout the night, it was refreshing. My best friend got distilled water and a glass of red wine, she said it was incredible! We started with the Calamari with a side of the most tasteful, beautiful, red marinara sauce to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was cooked to the upmost perfection, melted in my mouth and was not over fried. We crushed the ENTIRE appetizer, in what felt like seconds, I was saddened when we finished eating it all. Moving on to the main course, I ordered the Fettuccine, Sous-Vide Petite Cold Water Lobster Tail, in a Cognac Tomato-Cream Sauce. Now, when I tell you the presentation alone was amazing, when I took the first bite of Lobster with the fettuccine and cream sauce it was a whirl wind of flavors, and euphoria in my mouth. The sauce was creamy beyond words and everything flowed together so well. I am not exaggerating when I say, this was the BEST pasta dish I have ever put into my mouth. I only had leftovers, because obviously we were at an Italian restaurant and needed to try the dessert! We ended the evening with an Apple Tart with Vanilla Gelato. It was served warm, the outer crust was so crispy and delicious, the apples were perfectly soft and the mixture with the vanilla gelato was to die for, I could've eaten 5 of them, but I am 30 now and I have to be responsible (haha) My best friend also ordered a cup of coffee, black, two sugars, I tried it and wanted to drink the whole pot. I am not a fan of hot black coffee, but Aldo's Ristorante made me a fan, and I could drink a pot of that pure black perfection they call coffee everyday of my life. Hands down the best experience and I beg everyone in the ENTIRE state of Maryland, Country, and the entire world basically to try this amazing five star restaurant. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! **Chef's kiss**",

From the intimate yet airy atmosphere to the impeccable service, Aldo's is always guaranteed to be a memorable night out. I send all my Airbnb guests here for a special dinner and it never fails to impress!  But let's talk about the food.  First- the sauces. Sergio and Aldo have the magic touch when it comes to sauces. Each one a little different. Each one more delicious than the last.  For an appetizer I had the meatballs in a red sauce with whipped burrata. Possibly the best meatballs this Jersey girl has ever had.  But that sauce was like heaven on a spoon.  My brother had the tuna tartare- also amazing. Perfect amount of perfectly seasoned tuna on a crunchy shell with the right mix of sweet and salty. Delicious.  For dinner my dad had the chicken marsala which was some of the best marsala I recall tasting. I had the steak with an onion wine sauce. Cooked perfectly med rare and nicely set off with greens in a vinegarette. The perfect spicy complement to the slightly sweet sauce in the steak.  We added a side of the homemade pappardelle with the wild boar ragu. Always one of my fave dishes. And it didn't disappoint.  I wish I could remember her name, but the lady who waited on us (recently back from maternity leave) was delightful and charming. And did a terrific job of ensuring we had an amazing experience!  I was so enthralled with the food I forgot to take pictures.  Next time!",

The staff is always amazing and makes you feel so special as soon as you walk through the door. And above all - get the wild boar ragu. Heck, order a second helping to take home - its amazing!",

This is one of the busiest nights of the entire year in Baltimore as the city is sold out on hotels and restaurants are packed.  From the initial contact to the final bill, everything was perfect.  They were accommodating to let us choose a menu to service the needs of the large group.  We were not forced to choose off a pre-planned menu.  They made sure the specialty wine the client wanted was in stock in sufficient quantities.  The food was delicious!  Shrimp scampi, antipasta, many veal dishes including the osso bucco and of course the pastas!  If you don't have their carbonara, you have missed one of life's great pleasures.  It's a tough call between that and the Bolognese, you can't go wrong.  Sergio, Margaret and the entire staff knocked it out of the park!",

I found this place online from a heap of similar Italian restaurants in the area. I'm so glad I decided on Aldo's. From when we first came in, we were greeted at the door by the friendly staff. Our waitress, Shanti, did her absolute best to make sure we we're well catered to. The food was impeccabble. I don't even like eggplant, but this eggplant I love! I'm glad I stole some of my wife's food. The gnocchi I still dream about. Most importantly, the atmosphere is wonderful! We sat in the open alcoce with the setting sun. Couldn't have asked for anything better. We loved this place so much, we ditched our after dinner plans and just sat and talked for hours. Definitely adding this place to the \"revisit\" list.",

The evening began in their cozy bar area with a celebratory cocktail and some incredible wine! We were then escorted to a private room for our team dinner which was just the perfect size. We started with some appetizers and I would definitely recommend the gluten free meatballs and the eggplant. Our entrees were delicious and some of the best veal francais I have ever had.  We complimented our superb dinners with several mouthwatering desserts and I would recommend the tiramisu, cannolis and of course the homemade lemoncello. I can\u2019t wait to go back and try another amazing dish and sip on some outstanding wine. One of the best Italian restaurants I have ever visited.",

The wife had a pasta which she didn't like, but I did, so will be taking to work the next morning. Ordered the tiramisu for desert and that was also, you guessed it, amazing. Would highly recommend this place for date night.  My only 2 complaints would be the portion size. I know these high end places usually serve smaller portions, but I'm so used to having larger portions and definitely wanted more of that filet. The 2nd complaint would be th dress code. I thought this place was suits and dresses. Not the case. There was a group in there that had on football jerseys hoodies.  All in all was a great experience!",

However after receiving the drinks and appetizers it was a very long time in between receiving the meals we both ordered. The plates lacked and sides and for an entree one would expect that, nope just fish and sides extra. The prices are high, the portions are small. Also during the stay the lights seemed to go on and off at their leisure like it was a signal it was time to go. It was ending the evening, dinner reservations were at 930 pm. Don't think we will be returning, unfortunate because the reviews I read were all positive. Hope you have better luck.",

The hostess was polite, professional, and greeted us with warm smiles when we had initially walked in. That's about the extent of the pleasantness of the dining experience. The bread we were served was cold (perhaps this is normal here - I cannot comment on that), the wait staff inattentive (we waited 20+ minutes to have our card run; we also seldom saw our wait staff), and the main course portion sizes were a bit dismal. On the plus side, the location was good, the food quality was high, and the ambiance was perfect. For my first and only visit, I am rating this place as \"Okay.\"",

The second time was a Sunday evening and our experience was only a two star.  Both times we ordered the the lamb chops and Aldo special \"Ossobuco\" as well as the sauteed wild mushrooms.  First time they were great second time they weren't. The main courses were either burnt, cold and tasteless; the mushrooms were dried out and looked like they had been sitting out for a while. We had the same experience with the service. Saturday was great and Sunday was so so.  So what's the moral to this review?  Don't go on Sunday as there must be a different chef.  Finally, we did try the calamari appetizer and it was great - very light and fresh.",

In about 10 minutes the waiter came out to take our order. Our food arrived around 9:15.  The staff was friendly, and the ambience was lovely, though it felt like we were in a cellar of someones old house. The food was also very good.  The only thing that made this a bad experience was the wait time. I was on a company trip and we hoped to do some sightseeing before turning in for the night which was now not possible. With how expensive the meals were, I would have expected faster service. They didnt even apologize for the wait time.  I went to Zagat (because they had a Zagat award at their front door) to place a review but it doesnt allow you to place a review and so theres no way to let them know about the experience. Made me wonder if Zagat is getting paid for their stellar reviews only.",

We had the Library Room. Everything from the moment we arrived to our leaving was handled magnificently. The service received by the waiters attending our dinner was Outstanding. They named one of the cocktails the Rose Bellini and it was super. There was great flexibility in the menu offered to our group and every item served was wonderful, specially the Ossobucco, Chicken, Shrimp Scampi and Veal Saltimbocca that most attendees ordered.We had a delicious crispy eggplant parmigiana for 2nd course that was out of this world after our cold antipasto dishes that we shared and our salad of mixed greens was wonderful.  We brought our own cake and they served it for us. All attendees raved about their entrees and specially our family from NY, used to very good italian Restaurants.  The Library Room was the perfect choice allowing privacy and space and comfort for our activity since we had italian music played and a video- slide presentation. And at the end when we are coming down, my Mother in Law was the star with a good number of customers congratulating her and wishing her well. With absolutely no doubt I consider Aldo's the Best Italian Restaurant in all of Maryland. And will continue to do business with them. THANKS Aldo's!",
