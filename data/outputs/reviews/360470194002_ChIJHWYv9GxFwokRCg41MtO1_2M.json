        "caption": "I ordered takeout because I was craving authentic Mexican food one day, and decided to try this new spot that opened in my neighborhood. Let me tell you, the horchata was well worth the money. Whenever I order horchata, it comes in some tiny little cup that I finish in three minutes, but this one? This came in a soup quart container and I drank happily at it for a whole hour and more. Granted, I ordered the large for $5.50, but I did not regret it at all. The cinnamon and the rice notes of the drink are distinctive, and I thoroughly enjoyed my drink, even though I've had more flavorful horchata elsewhere. I loved the chorizo and al pastor tacos I got, and they have have been some of the best tacos I've ever eaten. They're stuffed full of meat, and it was falling out of my hands as I ate. They come with two sauces, a lime wedge, and some digusting radishes that I ate anyway because I dislike wasting food. Anyway, it was very satisfying, and I'm sure that three tacos is enough for a meal. I also ordered the spicy pork nachos, which I split into two separate meals, because the portion was so big. There's a lot of meat and cheese, but not too many nachos, which is fine with me. It means more bang for my buck if I get more protein out of my meal, and every bit of it was delicious. Lastly, I also ordered the famous birria tacos. I've never had them before, so I don't know what to expect. The beef flavor is potent, and extremely so. I think this is a good thing, but I don't like beef very much, so I won't be ordering it again. It was worth experiencing it once though. I've never dunked tacos in a jus-type sauce before, and it was as messy as you can expect. Definitely not for everyone, certainly not for me, but I can see why people like it. I am sure I'll be ordering from here again very soon.",
