WAY better than Bop-N-Grill, though no burgers will be found at Dak. The Spicy BBQ wings were sticky and delectable, and the Spicy Pork Rice Bowl was well balance, savory, and filling.  Pro tip: The wings are WHOLE chicken wings, not individual flats and drummettes. So an order of 5 wings is enough for most individuals. I shared my order and still was satisfied.",

But honestly, this place has pterodactyl sized wings tossed in flavorful sauces, I don't see why you'd need anything else. The Dak sauce is wonderfully sweet and tangy and the spicy sauce adds a mild kick to that spice, nothing too crazy though. It's all made to order as well, so freshness guaranteed, although that adds around 15 minutes of wait time.  I live in the area, so when I had my uninitiated suburban friends come down, we placed our order and went to Whole Foods to pass time and take advantage of the BYOB policy. That was a fantastic gastronomic experience, although one that my waistline can no longer afford. But for all you youngsters at Loyola and anybody else looking for quality wings, be sure to stop by Dak, you won't be disappointed.",

It's torture just waiting for the wings to cool off when you're hungry and know how good the wings are.  I'm usually satisfied after three wings since they're so huge.  I've had the wings with both the Dak soy garlic sauce and the spicy BBQ sauce and enjoyed each one.  I've also tried the rice bowl with bulgogi, which is delicious and again, huge.

They also have rice bowls! which are fresh to death! literally. The food is so fresh. I dont know how original Koreans would feel about the food, but it is great so screw Kim Jung Unn!",

The veggie bowl was more intense than we expected, in a good way. It was served in a large metal bowl, with rice, noodles, veggies and a fried egg on top, along with some tasty and fiery hot sauce.",

I thought the $9 was a bit much, but then I ate them I changed my mind. Definitely a fair price. The veggie bowl was equally amazing, which surprised me. I split one order of that and the 5 piece wings and it was perfect for 2 people. We actually had a wing leftover. I HIGHLY recommend this place! The staff is so nice too!",

Not that I eat Dak wings in bed. Or at least I haven't at the time of this posting. But now the idea is in my head. Hmm.  I have been known to eat the extra sauce out of the bottom of the to go container with a spoon. Wait. I've said too much. Forget all that.  Get the wings. Get a lot of wings. The other stuff is okay, but you can get better basic Korean food elsewhere. Go to this place for the wings.  Did I mention the wings?",
