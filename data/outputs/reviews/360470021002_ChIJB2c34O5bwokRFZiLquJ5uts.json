Unfortunately, long lines don't always correlate with quality. Los Tacos Al Pastor is a very small, unassuming place with no seating. It looks like it tries to emulate its Chelsea cousin in style and menu, but that is where the similarities end. It lacks in flavor, and you can see this plainly in observing the meat on the spits, which lacks the char and seasonings which give Los Tacos No. 1's meats their color. The flavor profile at Al Pastor is much milder, and there aren't as many options on the menu. (Where's the beef?!)  That said, Los Tacos Al Pastor remains a solid option around DUMBO, and a step above Taco Dumbo. I was really happy to see they had pi\u00f1a (pineapple) flavored Jarritos, and that the lines moved very quickly, given the lack of tourists.  Enjoy but know there is no comparison to el primero en Chelsea.",
