But for the first time it happened to go to this restaurant in a group from the same cultural background. we were ignored  while waiting to be seated like anyone else , the hostess was bypassing us and not once asked  us how many is our party , or name or if we prefer to sit inside or outside. after 40 minutes and everyone else came after us got seated and only because we complained , the manager tried to make things better but after telling us that we were intimidating! the hostess until we left she had not apologized.  we left without eating because it started raining outside and they could not accommodate us inside. they pretended to be polite  but would not give us an explanation why we were ignored over and over again although you can not miss us in the small space! I heard that they might be picky  and discriminatory with their customers , but as a man who believes and works in science I could not believe it without evidence. Sad day for the community.",

I've only had the Balsamic Brie appetizer, but it was delicious, Brie perfectly melted paired beautifully with nuts, fruit, rosemary, and toasted sourdough bread. Their wine selection is also quite unique and I liked the beaulougais I tried. I'll definitely have to come back to try more food sometime. Costs are reasonable for downtown Gainesville, and the superb quality of food is worth the price. Service was attentive and fast. Decor is rustic and romantic.  Edit: Came back for date night and food was delicious!!",

The jazz was enjoyable, but the volume of people at the group table (with the meet up) was regrettably noticeable. We split a cheese plate, a savory tart of the day, and two desserts. All were fresh and delicious. The blue cheese was especially scrumptious. The inside is inviting and there are daily specials worth trying. If you haven't been in yet, you definitely should give it a try. For French cider, a tart with small side salad, and a chocolate mousse the bill ran around $30.",

Anyway, I want to start by saying the service was Tip-Top all the way around--very awesome. I tried several different dishes and everything was fantastic! The only downside it seems (to me only!) in French cuisine is that everything is really heavy and all kinds of a fantastic cheeses. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a dairy allergy, so this is not a place I'll be with a frequent often, but if I didn't, I would be there all the time! I give them five stars because it's not their fault that cheese makes me feel crummy. Anyone who loves cheese and fine food with outstanding service will absolutely enjoy Alpin.",

The food is super consistent and never fails to please. All the food items are made fresh, with an open kitchen which is used by most of the staff. The Classic Brie Chaud is to die for, I always want to order another! I adore the Croques, and everyone I've brought has loved them just as much.  I don't think anything is over priced, and find it strange that people think so.  The wine and beer list update frequently, and I've never had an issue finding a wine I enjoyed. Interestingly, this last time I was in I tried a few wines and my favorite was actually the cheapest! Who would've known! The service is a bit slow sometimes and they do have an issue of lack of attention, but anytime an issue arose they were quick to fix it and very accommodating. (I assume they just know how good they are !!) I work at a bar in town and I always recommend Alpin, and many of my guests come back thanking me! I'm moving out of Gainesville soon but I will definitely be coming back to Alpin as many times as possible, as I will truly miss it. Thank you for an amazing experience, every time!",

My big and I went for dinner around 7PM on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy! But when we left around 9PM, it was packed. Tip: go earlier! We were seated immediately and was given the special of the day which we pretty much order from, haha. There dishes are so unique and delicious.  We started off with the leek soup - creamy and subtle! The taboul\u00e9, merguez, zaalouk with house roasted bell pepper hot sauce had the perfect combination. The zaalouk eggplant dish was roasted with the bell pepper which it was filled with exotic flavors. The zaalouk mixed so well with the taboul\u00e9 rice! I do have to say the merguez which was the lamb sausage was bland and lacking something to it. But, I think that was the purpose of the dish since everything else in that dish was flavor-filled. My favorite entree was the bacon and potato quiche! It was such a large portion and you honestly can't go wrong with this dish. Lastly, we order the special of the day, lemon and basil creme brulee. I cannot stress how yummy this dessert was! It's an interesting combination but yet, so good. Best part was the caramelized sugar on top!  Attentive service, unique and appetizing dishes, and warming/comfortable environment! I highly recommend checking out Alpin with your friends or family!",

The atmosphere is nice, but the live music can get a little loud sometimes. The staff are also capable of suggesting good pairings, vital for a small place like this. The small plates are excellent, and having tried most on the menu, come highly recommended. The location is alright, and if you come after 6, there is parking easily available. Otherwise, you've got to pay for parking or find street parking nearby.",

The escargot was prepared on a \"snail dish\" with the garlic butter and fresh herbs inaccessible due to the dish not having holes large enough to dip or soak them in. The croque monsieur was overloaded in cheese. The water is kept in glass bottles without a cap or any sort of cover for who knows how long as it is lukewarm to the taste. There are no more \"carafe d'eau\" besides the one on the table that's sitting there when seated and when you ask for a French baguette....they don't even have it made fresh. Claims to be a legit French restaurant that resembles very little of that of a French Restaurant.  Perhaps I have high expectations given I was very excited to have run across something that reminded me of my childhood, but I was quite saddened due to the lack of many things. I was hoping the staff said things with a French accent too, but then again, things here are Americanized.  I expected more of a selection too. I could hardly find anything at all to eat on the menu. I found it to be well overpriced for the quality of food.",

Similarly, I was not impressed by the staff. They weren\u2019t very friendly and we were sat at a table with two other couples, both of whom didn\u2019t want anyone by them and tried to move to a new table.

It\u2019s cute- we sat at a wooden bench table that was comfortable and was able to seat a large group.  The lighting is low- probably a good place for a date.  2.  Pro: Drinks.  All of us got cocktails, and we don\u2019t care about germs, so I tried the majority of the drinks on the menu- all good!  I even took a chance with mine (it had kombucha which is quite sour, so I wasn\u2019t too sure about a mixed drink with it) and liked it.  3.  Pro:  appetizers.  We got a couple of the cheese plates and enjoyed them. There was a Brie that had an orange spread that was good.  4.  Con. Entree.The majority of us got the special, which was a tart with tomato, mushroom, and anchovies on top.  Now, I\u2019m aware that anchovies are salty- but this was the saltiest dish I\u2019d ever eaten.  They left carafes of water on the table; I think I drank 5 or 6 glasses of water and I was still uncomfortably dry-mouthed because of the saltiness of the meal.  The entree was also very small- if we hadn\u2019t gotten the appetizers I would have wanted to eat again soon- which is fine sometimes for atmosphere or particularly good food, but because I hadn\u2019t enjoyed my entree it wasn\u2019t a good look given the price.  The others I was with who had the same entree agreed that it was disappointing. That said, maybe it was an off night, or the chef took a chance on something that just didn\u2019t work out, because I tried a bite of my friend\u2019s salmon croque and that was about 1000x better.  5.  Price.  It was a special occasion so I was okay with paying more at the time, but it\u2019s not a price I\u2019d like to pay regularly. given my experience, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d take the chance on a second visit if I\u2019m being honest.  In summary: nice atmosphere, good drinks and appetizers, maybe good for a date, but I wasn\u2019t a fan of the entree for the price.",

Prices are higher than reasonable, but considering the location is Gainesville you are paying for the experience of both culture and ambiance.  My husband and I went for the first time for Saturday Brunch and ordered 3 types of crepes, no drinks. Despite there being 6 or 7 staff and only five full tables seated at the time we arrived, it took almost 20 minutes to receive tap water and our table was facing the drinks station.  We then watched as people who had arrived after us received food and were finally graced with our first plate 55 minutes after ordering. While it was delicious, at this point we were annoyed as crepes are usually done in under three minutes and at no point was the restaurant full.  It took another 13 minutes to receive our 2nd plate and was then informed by our waitress that, \"They can only cook 2 crepes at a time,\" as their reason for being slow. This doesn't make sense as we'd never received any of our three at the same time, yet other plates were flying out to the patio despite it being half empty when we arrived. The last crepe arrived 10 minutes after we finished the second and the waitress was kind enough to ask us if we wanted the bill then or after. We finished eating and paid thus closing our nearly hour and a half long brunch consisting of three delicious but pricey crepes.  We were delighted at the opportunity for French food as my husband is European and I had lived across the pond for a while, but sadly the service and wait ruined this place for us. I REALLY wanted to like this place, and the food did live up to my expectations. Sadly, the service was less concerned with our experience than joking around with each other behind the counter.  Verdict: What should have been a lovely 35 minute brunch with my husband was instead a clock-watching, stressful experience where we were made to feel unwelcome and unimportant. We likely won't return.",

        "caption": "Terrible dining experience here. Would give it zero stars if allowed. We went as a party of 6 on a Friday at 7:40 PM. We were seated promptly and then waited ~15minutes before a waitress came by for the first time. We ordered drinks and waters. She brought out 5 waters for 6 people of which she did not refill a single time during the entire 2.5 hour dining experience. She brought a glass of Pinot Noir when asked for Chardonnay to one of our group. With my drink order she had to come back to the table for me to remind her what I ordered. We placed our food orders and she \"warned us\" on Fridays it takes a while for food to come out and it will come out at different times. I guess we assumed \"a while\" would be more reasonable than what we experienced. After 1.5 hours we had yet to be served any food. We went to inquire about what was taking so long and then ~5-10 minutes later our food began coming out. First arrival was a ramekin of goat cheese and crostinis. It took 1.5 HOURS to bring out cold goat cheese and crostinis. Second item a few minutes after, another goat cheese plate with grapes and crostinis and pear slices. Then about 10 minutes later the baked Brie and our three orders of the Croque-style sandwiches arrived. The final item the chorizo came after we had completely eaten the rest of the food and we sent it back to kitchen. I feel pretty strongly it would have been 30 minutes longer had we not finally said something. Don't get me wrong the food was tasteful but the experience was horrible. Instead of attempting to correct the situation the manager/owner was upset at us with being upset about the service and dining experience which is a terrible approach to customer service in the food industry. We tried to discuss with her about leaving prior to the food even coming out because of how poor the experience had been but they said they will \"see what they can do to make it up to us.\"  In the end they only took off 4 of our drinks and the chorizo plate that we sent back to the kitchen anyway from the bill. Needless to say I will not be returning and will let everyone at UF Shands know to avoid this place. If you go, go to have a drink before going to dinner elsewhere.",

Nice small selection that is over priced. One odd thing was that they have single cheese plates to have with wine, not a cheese plate featuring multiple cheeses... Again overpriced IMO. Cute French server and some more friendly employees. Overall: it's okay. I'd not oppose going here again, but I won't initiate it myself.",
