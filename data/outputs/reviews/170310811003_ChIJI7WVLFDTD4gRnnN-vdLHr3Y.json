As I approached the clerk I ask how the hot coco was I asked if it was strong and she said yes then I asked if she could make it more smoother by adding milk and she said NO! Lollll it was very weird and awkward I brush it off and just bought a banana bread as I am walking out I notice a glass coffee cup with the logos store and kept thinking about so I decided to return the next morning since my flight was leaving for 9:45, I arrive at goddess at 7:45, the same clerk immediately told me that they were not open and that I needed to leave, she wouldn\u2019t even let me finish to ask her that all I wanted was a cup as a souvenir and I was going to leave to my flight, I was appalled and extremely upset of the mistreatment I really hope that the clerk is fired because your business does not need someone like that in your store. I hope the the owner reaches out so I can pin point exactly who was working the shift and they can look back on the cameras of the trash person they have.",

The usual close of 9 pm was changed to 8 pm (per the sign at the door for winter hours) and promptly at 7:55 pm an employee / manager (dark hair, blue shirt) locked the deadbolt as I tried to enter, while 7+ shoppers were still shopping and completing their orders.  I only wanted a quick salad and desserts to go for 7+ people ready made (not that i had the opportunity to voice how quickly i could spend $100+ - deadbolt at 7:55 pm)  so a 5 minute transaction, but consequently a really bad experience.  Goddess is much better than this!!!  A) if you're closing at 8:00 pm instead of 9, PLEASE update the google maps / website for those of us who are loyal and count on you!  B) if you have a manager who is that rude, find him a new job.  @croe",
