Wait staff is charming, even if a bit slow. The rooftop bar is lovely.  Food menu is extremely limited, though I'm told that's due to COVID. What they offer (e.g., calamari & pizza) are fine but definitely nothing to rave about. Drink menu has plenty of options though. They also have s'mores service, which is absolutely delightful.",

The food has become awful - I had an order of Calamari and it has to have been one of the worst orders I\u2019ve ever had. It felt like the food had been microwaved - my partner had the pizza and felt the same about her food. Not only is it bad, it\u2019s horrendously overpriced, 16 dollars for a greasy overcooked personal pizza. Our service was really really slow and we couldn\u2019t swap the dish out because the kitchen had closed by the time a waiter came by to ask.  I should note the manager was nothing but gracious about the situation and shouldn\u2019t be held to blame.he was very kind and tried to help, but couldn\u2019t. The food is coming from the restaurant downstairs, instead of their own kitchen. I understand this, but should probably be communicated to guests better.  The drinks are good and the rooftop is beautiful - I hope their menu goes back to what it used to be because it\u2019s a shame to see such a great location wither like this. I can\u2019t recommend it until then - there\u2019s a lot of amazing restaurants and bars in the are. Go somewhere that actually wants your business",

Justin, the bartender, yelled at me \u201cdon\u2019t grab napkins from my bar\u201d. I\u2019m not a child! DO NOT talk to clients like they are children. I\u2019m a grown man. I ignored him and walked away, as I am a general manager myself in the industry.  The food I ordered was super late and the manager never apologized when he brought it to me . The whole experience was overall unprofessional . It reminded me of a college \u201cpregame\u201d bar . The way the bartender spoke to its customers shows their is no training nor standards and the company has an audacity to charge $16 drinks!",

It rained a bit earlier that day but the sun came out strong so we decided to give the rooftop a try. After exiting the elevator we were welcomed into a modern cozy indoor rooftop space with a stage and the bar. We grabbed two drinks and headed to the outdoor rooftop area.  The outside area is sort of like a large balcony with several large table and chair sets. A few seemed to be marked as reserved but we were reassured by another party that we could could just grab w/e was open. To our dismay the chairs were still a bit damp luckily we were able to find some dry ones. After finishing our first glass of wine we started to feel a bit peckish. After chatting with the host and server we were able to get table service outdoor to avoid walking back and forth for drinks and food.  We ordered the kalbi tacos and the chicken tacos. The kalbi tacos were amazing completely outshining the chicken tacos which weren\u2019t all that good. The wine opened up our appetites obviously because we made another order of kalbi tacos for a total of 2 by the end of the night! Lol  As the sun started to set, the indoor comedy show was starting. We shuffled inside to watch. The acts were mildly funny. The overall experience of wildays was perfect. It\u2019s a bit pricey but definitely a good vibe.",

They have vegan food and gluten free as well. You can sit inside or out. Outside is open air so smoking is allowed. Bartenders are polite and generally pretty quick. Servers helpful. If it's a really sunny day, there isn't much for shade, so wear sunscreen, or sit inside. It's my understanding that the benches outside aren't always necessarily reserved as they say, but you just must order from the server instead of bartender. There are a few high top tables at each end of outside rooftop which you can stand at and grab your drinks from the inside bar. The restroom is located inside past the hostess stand and then past the elevators. Their are two restrooms and they're unisex. The door is big so be careful, as I've run it over my toes before- ouch. Overall, nice rooftop, though not the classiest of crowds.",

We had a larger group and no reservation but also arrived at 4pm and there were plenty of seats. We were willing to be flexible on seating or even stand at the bar but the manager was extremely unpleasant and unprofessional. Our server was nice and even apologized for her managers behavior but I will be taking my business elsewhere. The views are not worth the unfriendly.",

On a street traditionally known as the lobbying capital of the world, Wild Days speaks to a new era for K Street NW- one that is defined by activists and creatives.  Once you enter Eaton, a new lifestyle hotel, take the elevators to the right (near the coffee shop) to the top floor. Once you step off the elevator, you'll be welcomed by a beautifully decorated lobby. Enter through the doors and you'll be in a gorgeous space decorated in mosaic art. There's a large bar and plenty of seats in the room to listen to the live music from the stage by the main mosaic. If it's warm outside, go outside to their rooftop seating. During winter, they have a fireplace for one of the circular tables.  They sell food (tacos!) and have a large drink menu. They have happy hour wine, beer, and a $9 punch (it's usually sweeter).  If you want a great happy hour spot in downtown DC, go here!",

Too bad then the food is forgettable at best. But there is little excuse about the drinks program. Get this \u2014 all of the cocktails on the menu are prebatched so the bartenders just have to shake them and serve them in appropriate glassware.
