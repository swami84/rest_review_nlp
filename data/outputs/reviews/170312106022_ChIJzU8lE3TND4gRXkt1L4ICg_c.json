The last few times I have ordered take out I have arrived when I was told the food would be ready only to wait another 20 minutes. Tonight I ordered my go to dish there and it just wasn't the same. Lower quality, less food, same price.  Not sure if I'll eat there again. At least not for a while.  Update: I recently ordered delivery from Friendship Chinese based on a recommendation from a friend. I told them about what I had experienced and they ensured me that things had improved.  He was right.  We ordered a shrimp noodle dish that was delicious. It was delivered quickly and all of the food was very good. I will be adding this place back into our rotation.",

I truly believe this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Chicago and to be close enough to get impeccable dining delivered on those snowy or exhausting days is such a treat. We got the Crab Ragoon and Egg Rolls for our starters. Having actual crab in a crab ragoon is nearly unheard of, and it's done in a way that the little purses are delicately done. The Egg Roll, light and crispy, chicken rather than the traditional deep friend pork. I choose Eggplant for my entree, the sauce was a subtle addition to this veg filled and friendly dish. My husband enjoyed his Sesame Chicken dish, all white meat, freshly prepared with great flavor. We missed dining-in but with the amount of time we spent with the gen pop with this pandemic going on, it was really nice to  be able to experience this meal at home and we only lost out on ambience, not quality.",

We were told that the mushrooms in the mushrooms tofu soup would be the same as in the Wild mushroom entree but there were only wedges of button mushrooms! They are not wild mushrooms. The waitress checked with the chef who said that they are wild but I don't know if any wild mushrooms resemble button mushrooms. 3. The soup also tasted like a simple Lipton broth with tofu and button mushrooms yet it was $7.95! Even the waitress said that the owner changed the menu not for the better and didn't update the website so entree items are prices are not the same as listed online.",

Barbarian steak had good flavor , was a nice cut of meat, we prefer more veggies which you get with the Hong Kong steak, which had good taste and good quality meat. it came with all the veggies and mushrooms wife likes. I liked the honey walnut shrimp, good sized and not excessive batter to make shrimp look bigger. tried the barbarian steak which was good and a good cut of meat. tried a chicken dish that was below average but even in the best places the kitchen will have an off night. Food is consistently above average. I with  disagree with negative comments about quality of food. Comments about service being slow are correct.

But now, oh man this place is bad. The food was subpar, overpriced for the quality, and the service was atrocious. Our waitress was clueless and unattenitive. There was a man that kept running back and forth when a private party arrived whom I assume was the owner and he displayed the same attitude. We weren't greeted when we arrived just asked how many. The place was practically empty when we showed up. There was only one couple seated in the restaurant when we arrived. We constantly had to keep asking the waitress for water, she would never come back to ask how everything was or if we needed anything more We had to clear our own plates and put them on a table next to us because the waitresses and owner were too busy tending to the private party and could care less about the 2 other tables that were dining there as well. A few of the appetizers were good but the mains were horrible. When we ordered our steak we were not asked how we wanted it cooked which I though was odd. We regretted  not saying anything because the Honk Kong steak was rare but the Barbarian steak or whatever it was called was charred and a little burnt. After being in the restaurant for a while, almost finished with our meal, the owner finally decided to greet us and ask us how everything was. I found this insulting considering the restaurant was pratically EMPTY and now he decided was the  time to acknowledge us. I can keep going on and on about how bad this place is but it will take me forever. We finally asked our waitress for our check when she decided to finally come out from wherever it was that she was hiding and it took her 20 minutes to bring it to us and then dissapeared again. I had to actually get up from my seat and say HELLO loudly for her to come out of hiding and take our credit card to charge us. Save yourself the time and aggravation and avoid this place at all costs. Chinatown has a lot better Chinese food than this. I would also reccomend New Star over this place anytime. We will never return to this place again.",

I literally ordered from Friendship at 4:30pm, hoping to treat myself to some overpriced Beef Chow Fun and some nice appetizers as I was solo this Christmas.  At 5:30pm the food was not delivered.  At 6pm I called the restaurant inquiring on my order, May asked for my name and said it was on its way, no more than 20 minutes away.  Given that the restaurant is literally 10 minutes from my house it was believable.  30 minutes later I called back saying it still hadn't arrived, she asked for my name again, it was still May who answered the phone, and she said, not to worry it was on its way.  10 minutes later, I decided to place a complaint with the online site i had ordered from, as it was now an hour past when it was supposed to be delivered, while chatting with the customer service agent, she said that the order had never been processed and would need to be canceled and reordered.  Meaning, that May over two phone calls had lied.  I was shocked. Having waited since 4:30pm for my food, expecting it at 5:30pm and it was now 7pm.  I then called the restaurant directly, and May was not apologetic, she was defensive saying she never lied and that she would have no idea what food or order was being delivered and what wasn't.  I explained to her, had i known that the issue an hour ago, I could have reordered and not still been waiting.  I was visibly upset, and she could not care less. I asked to speak with the owner, and he refused to get on the phone. As someone who likes to support neighborhood business and restaurants, i am shocked by this complete lack of care especially on Christmas.  I will not be ordering from Friendship again, and am going to look for a business that actually cares about my patronage and cares about customer service as the treatment I got from May on the phone was downright rude.  If you want overpriced, late delivery chinese food that doesn't care about your business...then this is your joint.,  Otherwise, I would recommend finding neighborhood places that care about their neighbors.",

The food was very bland. 5 spice colimari was more like salt and pepper and that's about it some slight sauce smeared on the plate riddled with a handful of burnt dry red chilies. No sauce on the actual colimari. The fire in the bird's nest is a $17+ dish and they use FAKE crab... And what I can only describe as frozen scallops... Seriously?!. It's not the place I knew 5-6 years ago. I took a picture at 7pm... Completely dead empty. And over the coarse of an hour and a half 3 pick up orders. Service was horrible. Waitress/hostess was more interested in sitting in the back of the restaurant than helping us with our experience. I asked for to go boxes, signifying we were finished eating. She didn't offer deserts. She brought boxes and sat down. I had to get up and flag her down to get my check.",

They turned their crab rangoons into almost 100% cream cheese and onion. Little to no crab meat, disgusting.  Then we hoped that the main course would be a saving grace. Wow were we surprised. Have you ever eaten muscle-y, hard to chew chicken? If you havent, this place has it, both of our dishes had this nasty low grade chicken. Also had cartilege in it. The dishes go for 12-15 dollars. The manager was nice when I asked him to take my dish off my tab as I only took one bite out of it. The aesthetics and atmosphere is nice. This place used to be moderately priced, small portions and pretty good food. Now it's small portions and still high prices, hence the 1 star. Do not know what happened but we won't ever come back there. Ruined Valentine's Dinner.",

The chicken was perfectly tender and the mix of vegetables was great. I can not wait to go back and get it again along with trying other things on the menu.  The only reason that it is not a full 5 stars is because the service was good but slow. The fish entree came out first and then we waited for the chicken for a good 5 minutes.  I will also say that if we were paying the full price (Tuesday is $10.95 entrees) I would have felt that the portions were a little light. I would have liked to have more veggies with the Honey Chicken (chicken portion seemed reasonable) and more fish (vegetable portion seemed reasonable).

Tried calling 10 times and no answer then I tried my other phone and the guy picks up then promptly mumbles something before hanging up. Tried calling a couple more times before leaving a voicemail (it takes about 3 minutes before their voicemail kicks in) stating that I will be declining this charge unless someone gives me status on things. Still no response 30 minutes later so going to have to cancel the charge.  Edit: Now 30 minutes after I post the review they call me and say if I want the order, it will be there in 45 minutes. An hour later the order comes. They offered no apologies, no comp, no discount for a 3+ hour late order.  The food is AVERAGE and it cost $52 in total for barely any food. Literally at any other Chinese place what I ordered would've been a \"Lunch or Dinner Special\" for $5.95-$8.95 yet I paid $52 for this supposedly high-end garbage? No drinks thrown in, no specials, no coupons. For a Dragon Bao I expected a kick, but it was just a plain bao. Orange Chicken is sponge like and even though they threw oranges in the mix you don't taste them at all! 3 bite sized Egg rolls for $6.95? Ironically they threw in more dipping sauce than egg rolls and there's  hardly any Peking duck in them?  The teriyaki chicken fried rice was plain chicken fried rice. There was no hint of teriyaki in it at all. So they messed up my order as well.  To top it all off my fortune cookie read \"Good things come to those that wait.\" What kind of madness is this? This goes on my do not recommend list.",

Over these nearly 20 year it has become my favorite restaurant in the city, even though it is a long haul from where i live. Initially I read a review in the Reader which intrigued me. Allen, the owner and chef, had come back to relaunch the family place. He transformed the cuisine by providing a cosmopolitan, and truly delicious re-imagining of Canton cuisine. I am a foody, but this place beats them all with its consistency and intimate atmosphere. Try the remarkable Long beans, the eggplant and bok choy, the peppercorn beef, and the whole snapper. I have held parties there for birthdays, as well as after conference dinners. Always a pleasure to go there. Try it, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",

This meal was for 3 people and was shocked when we received the $59.00 bill. I was in shock  of how expensive the little meal was. I normally order Chinese and can feed a family of 4 for 40.00 and still have left overs. The last thing I was told they charged extra for Chinese broccoli. Ok but when I receive my order there was no Chinese broccoli. So I called the owner not only to tell him how bad the food was and believe me the shrimp rice was light in color with a grassy taste. The orange honey chicken had no flavor and the chicken taste old. If you are picky on where you dine and this is your first time here just beware.

They had a lame excuse of \"the Lake St Location is closed until spring\". So the food came cold from the Logan Square location. They forgot my rice and crab rangoon. When I asked for a refund they told me I had to call a third party vendor managing their website. I shouldn't have to talk to a third party vendor to get my money back. My credit card company took care of the refund for me. The lady on the phone was rude. I will not be giving this place anymore of my business in the future.  [2014.05.18] Ordered again and same thing happened. I'm done with this place. 2 hours for food sitting and getting delivered is unacceptable business. I don't recommend ordering delivery from here.",

(nothing against older white people, my parents are older white people).  Back to the restaurant. The decor is the best thing about this place - lots of Buddha heads. The only reason we went here is Groupon (thanks for nothing, G). Got the roll to start - meh, had better, but not horrible. Don't remember what hubby got, but I got a vegetarian eggplant dish. I LOVE eggplant, I grow it in my garden, I buy it, I roast it, I bake it, I mix it with other veggies etc. This eggplant was so bad, I could not eat it. The worst eggplant that has ever came out of my kitchen would blow FCR's eggplant away. Not only was it so undercooked, I had to question whether they actually applied temperature to it or was the sauce the only thing warming it up. And speaking of the sauce - what sauce? Normally, a \"Chinese Eggplant\" dish is succulent, swimming in delicious brown sauce, soft and spicy. This was hard, dry and bland.  My husband forgot his credit card, so we had to come back and figured since a few reviews mention their crab rangoon as being good, we won't waste the drive up here and order some - FAIL, too rich, yet still tasteless. Never. Again. Oh, and they don't have a sweet-and-sour soup on the menu. What kind of Chinese place does not have s'n's soup?!",

Barely acknowledged, we were led to our seats.  The service was terrible, we never had the same person come up to us, always different, so we didn't know who our server was.  Nobody came to get our order in the 20 minutes we were sitting there until we mentioned it to the hostess, receiving another dirty look.  Our appetizer (crab rangoon) was amazing and things started to look up... until it didn't.  We had been in the restaurant a full hour and didn't have our entrees.  The food was horrible.  The website and menu present an upgraded chinese experience but seemed more of a rip off.  Fancy titles and ingredients for dishes that would be better at Panda Express.  No offense to anyone, but the fact that there were no asians or chinese patrons should have been the first red flag.  Americans who are not used to authentic asian food may be fooled, but I will never go there again.  I've had better chinese from the corner, storefront chinese restaurants where you can get a full meals worth for less than $10.",
