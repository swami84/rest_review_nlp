The place was atmospheric and romantic to me. But one member of my party said it was old-fashioned and tacky. The owner was welcoming us. The service was professional and quick. The staff was helpful when it came time to order our food. I ordered the Shrimp Linguini with anchovies and my party got Grilled Salmon Dijon and Chicken Meal. My choice was the best because the other foods were mediocre. The saltiness of the anchovies and capers went well with the other ingredients and pasta was cooked perfectly. It was worth every penny. So if you come here, I recommend this item strongly. Overall, it wasn't too bad, but it was nothing special. IMO, it was overpriced for the quality and quantity. I think one-time is enough for me.",

Bad management, terrible treatment and deception included, taking advantage of the large influx of tourists and its privileged location at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge.  Those who have time and want more detail: I was there with my husband in November 2017. We stopped at that place with the idea of \u200b\u200bconsuming something quick before returning to Manhattan and being able to use the services. At the door was an employee in charge of picking up customers and arranging them inside. We expressly told him that we were just going to have a coffee at the bar and he said it was perfect. Once inside, the woman who attended us was friendly until she heard the request. Then he changed his face and told us in very bad ways that an impossible coffee because in the kitchen (they really don't have a coffee machine in the bar?) They were overflowing. He literally said \"they are crazy in the back\" - They are crazy back there. (Thank you, Madam, for sharing with the clients the weight of your ineptitude). The fact is that between one thing and another it was my husband at the service and then me. There was a queue to enter the bathroom, for both men and women, and then the bathroom itself (there was one) was also clogged. I do not know if I explain. While waiting, I chatted with an Italian in our same situation and he said something that my husband had already agreed to buy two coffees to go. The waitress serving the bar in no way wanted us to \"run away\" without consuming and agreed to prepare those coffees when we saw that we were using the service. By the way, they were so bad that we threw them out after taking two sips. Worse than a vending machine. Of course, at $ 4 each.  Anyway, the poor Italians had worse luck than us, they were with two children and in the end they ended up consuming beer, sweets and whatever it was that they let them go to the bathroom. They just wanted a coffee ...  Clear expression of a place exclusively oriented to get the bitches out of the client (tourists, mostly) at the cost of treating him like cattle and giving him an unpresentable service.  (Original) Le doy una estrella porque no hay opci\u00f3n de dejarlo en blanco. Para hacer el cuento corto: trampa mortal para turistas. Mala gesti\u00f3n, p\u00e9simo trato y enga\u00f1o incluido, aprovech\u00e1ndose de la gran afluencia de turistas y de su localizaci\u00f3n privilegiada al pie del puente de Brooklyn.  Quienes tengan tiempo y ganas de m\u00e1s detalle: estuve all\u00ed con mi marido en noviembre de 2017. Paramos en ese local con la idea de consumir algo r\u00e1pido antes de volver a Manhattan y poder usar los servicios. En la puerta hab\u00eda un empleado encargado de recoger a los clientes y acomodarlos en el interior. Nosotros le dijimos expresamente que \u00edbamos solo a tomar un caf\u00e9 en la barra y nos dijo que perfecto. Una vez dentro, la mujer que nos atendi\u00f3 fue amable hasta que oy\u00f3 el pedido. Entonces cambi\u00f3 la cara y nos dijo de muy malos modos que un caf\u00e9 imposible porque en la cocina (de verdad no tienen m\u00e1quina de caf\u00e9 en la barra?) estaban desbordados. Literalmente dijo: \"they are crazy in the back\" - Est\u00e1n como locos all\u00e1 atr\u00e1s. (Gracias se\u00f1ora por compartir con los clientes el peso de su ineptitud). El caso es que entre una cosa y otra fue mi marido al servicio y luego yo. Hab\u00eda cola para entrar al ba\u00f1o, tanto de hombres como de mujeres, y luego el ba\u00f1o en s\u00ed (hab\u00eda uno) estaba tambi\u00e9n atascado. No s\u00e9 si me explico. En la espera, charl\u00e9 con un italiano en nuestra misma situaci\u00f3n y me dijo algo de que mi marido ya hab\u00eda acordado comprar dos caf\u00e9s para llevar. La camarera que atend\u00eda la barra no quer\u00eda de ning\u00fan modo que nos \"escap\u00e1semos\" sin consumir y accedi\u00f3 a preparar esos caf\u00e9s al ver que us\u00e1bamos el servicio. Por cierto, estaban tan malos que los tiramos despu\u00e9s de dar dos sorbos. Peor que de una m\u00e1quina de vending. Eso s\u00ed, a $4 cada uno.  En fin, los pobres italianos tuvieron peor suerte que nosotros, iban con dos ni\u00f1os y al final acabaron consumiendo cerveza, dulces y lo que fuera para que les dejasen ir al ba\u00f1o. Solo quer\u00edan un caf\u00e9...  Clara expresi\u00f3n de un local orientado exclusivamente a sacarle las perras al cliente (turistas, en su mayor\u00eda) a costa de tratarlo como ganado y darle un servicio impresentable.",

We were desperate to eat & in a hurry!  The staff were rude & incompetent, the food took for ever to arrive & when it did it was poor to put it very politely  We walked out in the end but had to pay for the rubbish they served!!!!!  This was the WORST RESTAURANT I\u2019ve eaten in for ages - GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE !!!! Even our tour guide warned us away !!!!! But sadly desperation & hunger foolishly lead us to this revolution :((((((",

The place looked cozy inside. The EXPERIENCE: The waiter had attitude and was arrogant so much that he cared more for striding with importance between tables, than to actually care for the them. Once food arrived, I could not grab his attention anymore, so had to ask his coworker to get the check after about 30 minutes. No refills, no check-ups if all was good, nothing. The bar has a joke of a selection of hard liquors, and since they didn't have anything that I liked, the bartender suggested an awful digestif, only allowing me to sniff at it, no samples. I could barely drink it. The person sitting behind at the table appeared to be the owner or manager. Was yelling loudly all the time and listening to music on his phone, and pestering waiters passing by with loud comments. Just AVOID this place, until a better one comes to its place.",

Timmy on the other hand, had Spaghetti and meatball,  The service was bad.   The tap water came in room temperature.  I had to ask for ice and the waiter did not know whom/ where to obtain them.  After seeing her run back and forth the reatuatuant twice.  she finally brought us a glass of ice.   They were cheap on the bread and butter as well == We had to ask again.. The place was very inattentive.   Timmy got sick from the spaghetti all night,  I had a feeling it was either the  meatballs that look processed since you can cut it like butter  OR the gradated cheese they gave him from a canister and not freshly gradated by hand..  I called 311 and filed a report  4:35AM   ==     DO NOT EAT THERE.  I should have seen the sign since the place was empty to begin with and all the other place were crowded and people waiting in line.  There was an old man and a young lady who were wearing RED t- shirts.  I asked  one of the waiters who it was , he old me that he is a waiter.  First of all, He was on the phone carrying on for the duration of our stay, Why would any establishment would let their waiter  eat and talk in public on his cell phone in view of the public.  Also his female companion seems like she was running the restaurant .  She was running around changing the climate control in the restaurant and helping our waiter  our bill.  Their staffs are unequipped   and were not giving the necessary training / tool to run this place.   This place is a F===ing joke and so is the owner.",

        "caption": "The bread basket said it all - cheap tasteless bread, served with 2 butter containers, except there was no butter - it was marinara sauce (yep!) in one and olive oil with  two olives in the other container. The soup was watered down, the parmesean cheese was old and on top of it the waitress claimed it was fresh, no apologies there. The service was chaotic, had to get up from the table to go ask for service. Wait staff only cared to ask for more orders of  wine/ beer/ other alcohol.  Overheard the waiter telling the young group at the next table that people from all over the world eat there - tourists visiting the bridge, lured in like us by the decor and the cheerful welcome. Avoid this place, run a mile from it.",
