The macaroni was StoveTop and it was decent had a bit of flavor but it definitely didn\u2019t leave me wanting more.. The Yams were pretty good as well besides the fact that it looked like baby food.. Now Last But Least That Muffin was so Hard I was left feeling a tad bit Disrespected lol but seriously it was Beyond Dry and Hard Like it had been deep fried & Sat under a light for hours. Everyone tastebuds are different so this place may be a Hit for others but for me its on my Probably never try again list.",

The green beans taste as if they were fresh out of a can. I sometimes use canned green beans but no one knows it. The macaroni and cheese, let\u2019s just say kraft taste better. I gave it two starts because the place was clean and the young lady that waited on me was somewhat friendly. I have no plans to return.",
