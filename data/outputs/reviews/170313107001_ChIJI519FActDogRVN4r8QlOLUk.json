Luckily, my boyfriend is not to make a big fuss about situations like these, but considering we\u2019re in COVID times, I think the waitress should\u2019ve informed us and apologized for having brought him eaten food as nowadays, you can never be too safe. I\u2019m very thankful for the other patrons who pointed this out as we would\u2019ve never known otherwise. During these crazy times, no strangers should be sharing food as you can never be too safe. That was my only concern here and the food took a while to arrive although it was not busy.

I told the waitress that we completely disliked the skillet and I was told that if I had said something right away that they would have done something. I really dont see the diffirence between saying something right away or later on. If my waitress would have come to our table and asked if everything was ok, I would have not had to wait to tell them how bad the skillet was. Needless to say, I still had to pay for the skillet even though we didnt eat it at all. I will not be going back to this place nor do I recommend it.

The whole aesthetic of the bar is very beautiful, the ambiance of it is truly peaceful and chill, but the main focus of the bar/restaurant is of course their drinks and food. Honestly, I've been to almost every single bar on 18th Street and I can say that no other bar's cocktails are as good as the ones that are served here. The bartenders Juan and Adrianna are super sweet, friendly, and just great workers who know exactly how to make you feel at home. I love this bar so much that I have become a regular here, as soon as I walk thru the door, Juan (the bartender) greets me by name and already knows what I'm going to order and serves it to me before I could respond. I truly love this place and I recommend it to everyone looking for a simple, chill place to unwind and have a great drink.",

I figured I should give it another shot. So my girlfriend and I made our way over there on a Sunday evening. We arrive at 10:15pm on Sunday, open the door, and walk in. The place is a ghost town. There's a couple at the table closest to the door and a lady sitting behind them tells me and my girlfriend that they are closed. I wondered how they were closed when their hours on Google said they closed at 11pm. Perhaps Google made a mistake? I didn't know. Then we left and curiosity got the better of us. We turned around and looked at the hours posted on the door.  The large sign showed that they close on Sundays at 11pm.  Checked Google again. Closing time on Sunday is posted as 11pm.  Checked Yelp. 11pm.  So, I can't help but feel a tad miffed and disappointed. All signs show me that the restaurant should've been open for another 45 minutes and that my girlfriend and I should have been able to enjoy the drink that we set out on purchasing. Instead, I type this from another bar that actually is open during the hours that are posted on their door. Crazy idea, right?  In order to avoid this type of confusion in the future, i've decided to simply patronize any of the other establishments in Pilsen. No hard feelings.",

Questioned her about it, and she bold faced lied to my face that it was bison, as she's the one who orders for the kitchen. Like I don't know what beef is?! Have we all not been eating beef our whole lives?! She could've simply said they were out and I would've ordered something else. Instead, they chose to be shady, and I will not be returning.

There are plenty of other delicious places in Pilsen who will treat you with the respect every customer deserves. So the sorry behind this is that the last time I went there with a friend from out of town, I had to send a drink back but we were never checked on for a solid 20 minutes which is when I flagged someone over, which I hate doing. So then apparently the manager, who we found out is also the owner, came over, thinking she was coming over to apologize that no one checked on us for so long, but instead she was incredibly disrespectful and scolded me like a child because \"I waited so long,\" which she wouldn't let me explain why (which was that no waiter came over to check on us and I had to wave someone over to get their attention), she would just in interrupt me. Mind you, we had THREE servers that night because things were slow, and not ONE of them came to check on us after we tried our food. We will never go back again because of the poor experience. It is not worth feeling such disrespect and lack of understanding from a business, most notably from its staff, manager AND owner.",

For $12 bucks an appetizer, I know this place can do better! But ill be back, usually amazing experience and this was my first bad time in 5 years here",

The chicken chilaquiles with mole were good, but definitely not almost $30 good--the chicken was kind of bland, and just sliced and plopped on top of the chips. Maybe more seasoned shredded chicken would have gone better with the chips and mole? Or chilaquiles are just not the right dish for a place with these prices--El Milagro makes a mean chicken mole taco and nice and mushy chilaquiles for like $5, . I'd like to go back and try something else, though, next time I really want a cocktail.",

There's enough burger places with the exact same burgers that you can shop around. But they had nice paintings.  So, second try was also good. I got the Parmesan fries. It said truffle oil on the menu, but I guess I took for granted that they wouldn't use it like salt; I was wrong, and those fries didn't come off the bill but the truffle oil came out through my pores for days. And no, the chef doesn't think it's too much and no you can't just have Parmesan fries next time because it's all together.  Gave it a final go. Apparently kobe beef looks like tartar when it's medium rare. It wasn't good in any case (the ketchup style sauce was), and my partner's drink wasn't either (that did come off the bill).  I don't quibble about bills normally; you try it, maybe you don't like it, provide feedback, but suck it up because you ordered it. But when you provide feedback and then you're told that you're wrong, that's when you don't suck it up.  I know that if they read this review they'll say they're glad and they don't want my business anyway, and I know that because they told us as much when we provided feedback.",

I've eaten here about 3 times and each meal I've had was great.  It's a little Mexican with a twist of gentrification.  So it you hate that word, maybe you may want to chose a different place.

        "caption": "The place is very cute and trendy! Our server was very nice. We were the first to get seated and the last to get our food. I thought it was odd that everyone around us was getting their food before us as we were the first to put our order in. Our waiter recognized the wait and comped one of our drinks.   45min after ordering our dishes finally came out. I ordered the braised beef with the side of risotto.But instead of the risotto what came out was the mash potato. I was disappointed because the waiter was raving about how delicious the side of risotto was and out came mash potato. The price point of the menu is pretty pricey for the area. Despite the wait, overall the food was good. I would give this place another chance for redemption.",

The atmosphere is chill and relaxed with a beautiful interior.  Wood finishes are a nice touch!  I love that one of the servers recognizes me each time I come in, even if a week or two goes by!",
