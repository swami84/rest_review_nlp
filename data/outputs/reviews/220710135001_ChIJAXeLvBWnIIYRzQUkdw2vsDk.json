We got the Irish coffee which tasted amazing. I've also had their bloody mary and mimosa before. Once seated we had already checked out the menu and knew what to order. We had a crab omelet and the French toast banana foster. Both were amazing and very filling. The service was good but nothing to talk about. But the food and drinks make it worth it.

My significant other and I checked in on Yelp, and we still had to wait for a while. I understand why. The location had a fun vibe, and the food was incredible. The coffee was fresh and tasted great. As a pancake lover--with cinnamon roll pancakes being my all-time favorite food--I naturally was ecstatic to see cinnamon swirl pancakes on the menu. That is why we choose to go here. They had excellent flavor and were not too sweet. I did not even need any syrup because of the great taste. I decided to be \"healthy\" and substitute fresh fruit as my side. This was also a good choice. My significant other ordered the bananas foster pain perdu, and this was also an extremely tasty meal. The next time I am back in New Orleans, I am 100% coming back here!",

My husband tried their spanish omelet, which was pretty tasty as well. Waiter was attentive and really appreciated that very much.

Once we were seated, the service was really good and food ordered was quickly delivered. I had biscuits with one having fried chicken and sauce and the other with pork and gravy... And an egg on top of both. Just wow and there was a lot of food. I ate half of each and then the remainder for dinner later. This was a nice change to the normal fare in New Orleans but still different and delicious.",

I had a hot cocoa and banana French Toast, which was a great choice. I would highly recommend visiting the Ruby slippers cafe. A suggestion I would have for them is to make space and add  a few more tables so the wait is not too long. However you should definitely visit.  *reviewed by my 10 year old.",

Our waitress was nice, but a couple small things: no cream for the coffee when we sat down and being asked to give her our syrup for the next table was a little tacky. I came for breakfast, not to work. The eggs cochon was a pulled pork version of eggs Benedict, the eggs were great and the meat was tender. The biscuits were amazing and gigantic.

I haven't had a good breakfast of eggs and grits in a minute. Also the biskets are soo dense they could be a meal all by themselves hahaha. My girl had the Egg's Benedict, can't remember which ones but we went there two mornings and she had a different one each time. I stuck to the eggs and grits. Mmmm so good. Will be back in NOLA soon and will return to this spot. Depending on the time you may have to put your name on a list and wait. But so worth it. Day one we had a 20 min wait but day two we got right in. Good luck.",

Of all the restaurants we've tried during our visit, they had the best catfish (not so salty as to spike your cholesterol, but not bland either). Their grits came unseasoned, but I prefer it that way so I can add the metric ton of salt and pepper I want. And the biscuit was amazing. I truly wished I could've finished it, but they just give you so much food. I'd recommend the Ruby mimosa, it was great as well. Service was great, especially considering how packed the place was.",

The food was really good. The presentation was awesome & the prices were perfect. Service was fast, attentive & friendly. Our visit went smooth for a party of 6. Cant wait to come back! Please note!!! Several parties walked in thinking they had a reservation, but they were at the wrong location which is apparently only a few blocks away! Just be aware so you don't make the same error.",

She also asked my friend what was she looking for when she was looking around. Her tone was off putting. Just plain old rude.  She also laid our tickets down while we were still eating stating that she needed to close out her tickets. BTW my friend had her hand out to receive her ticket and ahe laid it on the table. You can do better . I ordered the bacon praline pancake it was delicious. However the bread pudding pancake had a texture that was unpleasant, borderlining on being rubbery. I was able to exchange for an egg.  The atmosphere was nice the other servers were nice.",

I have given you the best places to eat for breakfast from San Jose to Anaheim, Memphis to Myrtle Beach, the Windy City to Bean Town, and a Ron of places in between, so now we stop in the Big Easy for breakfast at Ruby\u2019s Red Slipper!  The name derives not from Dorothy and Kansas, but from the notion of homecoming and it\u2019s revival after Hurricane Katrina. Now this particular location is just off of Canal St. on Decatur, not to be confused with the location in the Business District. This is a small, more quaint, location with a \u201cblink and you might miss it\u201d door.  My son and I had no wait and were sat immediately. Unfortunately our waiter who was awesome, forfeited his right for a shout out by not introducing himself, but he doubled as the bartender so he was pretty busy in his defense.  If you have read any of my reviews on breakfast, you know that it all starts with the coffee. It must be in a decent size mug, hot, and be kept full. This was some of the best tasting coffee I have EVER HAD, grown right here in NOLA.  There is something to be said about eating in New Orleans. As one of the culinary capitals of the world you will find classic dishes and ingredients jumbled together in a Mad Scientist style manner. Such was the case with my sons Eggs Benedict which he usually is a traditionalist. In this case they used a fluffy buttermilk biscuit, with poached eggs, glazed bacon, and hollandaise sauce. He left absolutely nothing but the plate.  As for me, I was the big winner! Going completely off book, I took the waiters advise on the daily special and was sooo glad I did. It was a Chicken Viera that started with a base of goat cheese grits ( I know I know I had to contemplate that one too) with a homemade salsa at one end of the banana bowl and a green chili sauce at the other end. In the center was a pulled chicken and scrambled egg. Again the ingredients on their own would cause for pause, but together it was outstanding! The dish was complimented with a buttermilk biscuit of my own, with a tasty brown sugar cinnamon spread.  At the end of the day when in NOLA you have to expand your palate and try new things that don\u2019t sound like they should go together. I don\u2019t give away five stars for just any restaurant but the Ruby Slipper will now be on my can\u2019t miss list when visiting the Big Easy to start my day!",
