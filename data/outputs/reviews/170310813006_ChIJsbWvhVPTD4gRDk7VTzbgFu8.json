I have been here before even after my fellow coworkers warned me how HORRIBLE this place is! Don\u2019t let the name fool you, food is not fresh AT ALL, I tried the salad and it was okay not the best, but I wanted to give this place another try and I regret it so so much. I ordered the lemon grass soup and it TASTED LIKE MICROWAVED WATER WITH RAW VEGETABLES!!! That\u2019s literally what it was, so I went back to the place NOT ASKING FOR MY MONEY BACK but to ask if they can simply remake it because I literally thought it was a mistake they made on the water soup, but very rudely the man got defensive and started treating me really horrible and told me \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t don\u2019t buy from here\u201d after that I respectfully told him I didn\u2019t like the way he talked to me so I asked to speak to someone else and he told me he was the manager and he was the owner and kept saying \u201clet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go\u201d very unnecessary, so I just walked away. I don\u2019t recommend this place at all! Very poor service and disrespectful I should\u2019ve listen to my coworkers and not come here, there is another place down Chestnut st called Cafecito and I totally recommend that place rather than coming here trust me you will save time money and the food is way better than here. If that man is really the owner he should really learn manners and customers service.",

I\u2019ve had Freshii several times before and the rice or grain is always on the bottom and veggies are stacked on top, right to the top of the bowl. I feel like they did this to save money on veggies. For $10.99 I expected way more than this. Now I did enjoy my meal, just wish I got the full size I ordered, I didn\u2019t order a half size.",

He said if I wanted to ensure they got my order, I should have come in and placed it myself.  We were at a tournament all day, that was not an option.

I am a BIG fan of Freshii but this location just left a bad vibe and we didn't even give them our business. They were skeptical and narrow minded about what we were trying to communicate to them in regards to a project we did for a local business in the area. I would not recommend supporting this location of Freshii and the man who runs it. If you do, you may be contributing to an establishment that does not allow innovation and compassionate communication to live.",
