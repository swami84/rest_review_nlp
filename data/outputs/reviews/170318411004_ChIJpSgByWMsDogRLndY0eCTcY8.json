I can see how some customers find their customer service a bit lacking, especially in comparison to American dine-in's. They are a family trying to make a living and serve the community with distinct cuisine, unlike restaurant group corps with invested training in hospitality.  Delicious dishes, especially drunken rib, so flavorful.  I would recommend!",

Waitress served other customers, took a very long time to take my order, and I was given no water. After receiving my order and trying to get the waitress' attention, she gave me a crazy look, took awhile, wiped tables, and tried finding other things to do before coming. I asked her for onions and it felt and looked like everyone in the restaurant (all Chinese by the way) stopped and starred at me (African American by the way) like something unbelievable just happened. A man came out from the back, turned on and watched the tv a bit, and gave me more unfriendly looks. Neither staff, at any time, simply mannerably spoke, saying hello, how are you, or any of that! IMMEDIATELY, after I finished eating, the waitress rushed my check to me. And, she never came to the table to get my money, although she saw I was ready to pay. She just found things to do and stood behind the register. I simply walked to the register, paid her (of course without tipping), and left.  Later, I saw a young man in Chinatown, who had been sitting at the table next to me in the restaurant. I asked him if he had noticed the horrible service in the restaurant. He (who is, by the way, Chinese), with an attitude, said ALL KINDS of awful excuses like, \"She don't speak English. She was the only one working in the restaurant. What did you expect\", etc. The waitress understood and spoke English well with me. The restaurant was not crowded or busy. And, she many times (as I said before) was finding things to do or look busy and just standing behind the register. Needless to say, I will not go back there. Judging by other reviews, New Restaurant doesn't seem to care about good customer service and bad reviews, which I find quite arrogant if that is the case.  It has also been difficult finding a restaurant in Chinatown which I find to have a good combination of good food, clean facility, affordable / reasonable prices, and good service.",
