They have many options with more mixed types of foods from diffrent cultures. And this would be my first time seeing a large icecream and dessert bar that had more that 2 or 3 options. The sushi was well cut and the food had well seasoned that didn't taste like it was from some box. Most of it was fairly warm which was fine by a good amout was really hot. They had very good service and once  you were done with something they were quick to take it. It very spacious and large enough so it will be easy to walk thru and was very cleaned and neat. The only problem was were the televison was and the prices which is more of a personal problem.",

I wouldve probably still given the place a 4 if the waitress didn't demand a tip, and then once a tip was given whined about how it wasn't big enough. Personally, I feel like if I'm collecting the food myself and all you really do is pick up used plates it isn't really deserving of a $60 tip as you aren't really \"serving\" me.  It's also not a good look to chat in a foreign language in an obviously negative way about customers in front of the customers to your coworkers; seems quite unprofessional to me.

I read some reviews before going, and after reading some of the negative reviews that I did see, I was completely shocked.  The food was absolutely delicious. A lot of reviews were saying that flavor was absent, but on the contrary, the food was perfectly seasoned, for the most part. Their was 2 or 3 items that were under seasoned, but that\u2019s nothing considering there\u2019s SOOOOOOO much to choose from.  The staff was friendly and very professional. And again for 14$ per person, it\u2019s probably the cheapest priced buffet I\u2019ve ever been to with some of the best food I\u2019ve ever eaten. It is mostly seafood, but they do have American food items as well, such as chicken wings and fries and other items.  They have a salad bar, fruits, veggies, and a hibachi section in the back.  All in all, I was more than pleased with the price, food, and service. To anybody who wrote a negative review, you lost ya mind lol.  100% me and my fianc\u00e9e will be back, no questions asked.  P.S.   it was so good I alone ate like 4 whole plates and left 10lbs heavier and barley able to walk lol :)",

The overall appearance reminded me of a buffet I visited in Hagerstown,  MD.  Lunch is $10, $12 with a drink. The location is clean and well maintained. The staff is polite and attentive. I will note here that while waiting at the hibachi station, my third plate of food, someone cleared my drink and they seated someone else at my table. I grabbed another table and informed the staff. They apologized and brought me a new drink. No harm, no foul.  I found the food to be fresh looking and tasting. A good variety of seafood with other Asian and American choices mixed in. I am pretty sure nothing here is going to be non-GMO, wild caught or identifiable as sustainable or not.  The salmon was definitely fresh tasting and nicely seasoned. They have a salad bar with about a dozen ingredients plus dressings. The hibachi station had a limited number of ingredients but all also were fresh. I did not try the Pho but noted several customers were happy with it.  I enjoyed the cold steamed shrimp,  a few were overcooked but that did not matter as it's a buffet. They put some type of large mussels out, also cold and cooked.  There were a number of sushi offerings, I did not try any. Tons of desserts and fresh fruit.  I give them five stars as a buffet that meets expectations for the price point.",

Most seafood items like snow crab legs, lobster, mussels, etc were super salty. It tasted like they were soaked in salt water for a long time before cooking.

We came in today for lunch and the host just had this really straight face, and he kept looking at me very weirdly. The food looked good, but taste-wise, was mediocre at best. The crab legs were small and drenched in grease, the shrimp tasted like rubber, everything else tasted either undercooked or lukewarm, nothing tasted or felt freshly prepared in my mouth. I am, as I'm writing this, partially scared that I will contract something from the oysters I ate, because I had eaten 3 oysters and those did not taste the freshest either. I did not try the korean grill or the hibachi, but I hear that's no showoff either. The only part that's holding me back from giving this place a 1 star rating, was the ice cream. That stuff was good but the freezer was just a little bit warm. Overall I do not recommend this place, I wish this newly opened restaurant the best of luck and endeavors on improving their style.",

The only dessert they have with the most options is the flavored icecream. I think they need to work on bringing a variety of desserts so that people can choose what they like.

Hostess was not happy when we asked not to be seated in the party room section since the restaurant was not busy when we got there at 5 : 30 pm on Saturday and we are a family of 3 and not a large party of 10.  Waitresses are very nice , provided good service.  They have crab legs for dinner and we wanted to come and try it out, the crab legs are on ice instead of steamy hot,  they are broken into individual leg,  not in clusters.  They are very salty to eat and they do not smell fresh at all.  Don't come to this buffet for the crab legs. Sushi was decent and the bowl of beef pho was not bad for a buffet. Overall, very average food, nothing special, this is my first visit and probably the last,  much better buffet less than a mile away .  The restaurant is brand new, very clean, but the quality of the food is lacking,  need to improve to stay in business.",

I cannot share my opinion about every type of food, but the seafood was not fresh (as evidenced by taste), and crab had a strange, old flavor (not old bay, 'old') and was of poor quality. In retrospect, I'm glad I didn't attempt their oysters.  Won't be going back anytime soon. Outside the seafood, there may be some decent selections of food in the cooked entrees; the spread of food was decent, if exceptionally normal. I added a star because the staff seemed friendly and professional, and overall the restaurant was clean.",

Besides the staples of an Asian buffet (fried rice, beef and broccoli, lo mein, pizza, French fries, etc), the food is usually some kind of seafood (fish, shrimp, crab, oyster, etc). Surprisingly, they have snow crab legs. For someone who prefers chicken and beef to seafood, this is not the buffet for me. However, the quality of the seafood seems to vary, with some pieces verging on spoiled. The sushi offerings are pretty good for a buffet. They also have hibachi, Korean bbq, and two types of pho.  The chocolate fountain is pretty good for a buffet, drying to a smooth and consistent solid. They have a good variety of ice creams: strawberry cheesecake, mint chocolate chip, moose tracks (with fudge and peanut butter), cookies and cream, graham central station, butter pecan, superman, chocolate, vanilla, cotton candy, and raspberry sorbet. For people who like jello, note that the jello here has peach in it.  The way the seating spaces are arranged is interesting. When you enter, there are two seating rooms on the right (one big divided in two and one small), one on the left, and one in the back behind the pho and hibachi. All of the rooms except for the small one on the right have good ventilation and air conditioning. That one room is very hot, probably a combination of bad ventilation and being stuck between the kitchen and the fountain drink and ice machines.  The bathrooms are a bit wet but otherwise fine. Interestingly, the flush handle in the women's bathroom is on the right. Usually it's on the left. I'm told the handle is on the left in the men's bathroom.  Lastly, they have this fountain in the corner by the exit that honestly seems out of place. I think they're going to work more on it later, but now it's just a fountain with dirty water and a strong chlorine scent.  Overall, it's a bit better than the average Asian buffet but I wish they had more non-seafood options.",

On an absolute scale, it was very average in quality and taste but had a large selection. Compared to other local Asian buffets, it was a little better. Things I enjoyed: stir fry with spicy sauce, braised sirloin?, chocolate fountain, some of the sushi rolls. Things I disliked from my plate and the kids': anything non-Asian such as mac 'n cheese, fried head-on shrimp that deteriorated as I tried to peel it, veggie lomein and fried rice, cheesecake-like dessert items. Overall, I noticed that items were generally under seasoned, which made several of the dishes very blah.  Location was nicely decorated and very spacious. Wish the staff had uniforms to identify themselves (Video uploaded showing the grill cook in baseball cap, t-shirt, and jeans). Get a second paper towel dispenser in men's restroom or put the single dispenser in way out the room. The dispenser is unreachable for the patron using the right sink.  Lastly, one of few buffets that makes banana pudding with vanilla yogurt, not French vanilla. Thank you. Please add more Nilla wafers.",

He was right because it was open within a few days. We went on Mother's Day and I thought it was way better than our other local Hibachi restaurants. Coming from someone who's real picky I thought the food was delicious. The place is gorgeous and I hope it remains like that. If it doesn't blame the customers who probably treat their home the same way. My only recommendation is that the crab legs are kept warm and not over ice. I hope they change that real soon. I wanted some so bad but I'm not eating cold crab legs. I saw kids dipping their own ice cream who can barely reach it. Someone was nice enough to help my son. The customer service was also great. As for paying separate for a soda like someone wrote that's mostly everywhere nowadays. $1 and some change for unlimited drinks is nothing.",
