Make sure you get hot pizza for best flavor. It might be a hole in the wall, but the best pizza I've ever had!",

        "caption": "I went all the way from the south side to this low, poor quality pizza shop because my mom brought pizza here once, really liked it, and was in the mood to have some so I walked there after calling and verifying they do not deliver. When I get there there are men smoking near the establishment, kids playing and trying to scare a bird that flew into the shop, and the man behind the counter taking the orders does not even pay attention or acknowledge the order in which the customers are lined up. It's horrible that they didnt make this business a real restaurant where customers can wait inside instead of having to smell second hand smoke while waiting your turn outside. This establishment only fits about 5 people standing up near the counter; there is no area to sit. To make matters worse, a man skips in front of me and the man behind the counter takes his order like nothing happened because he has no clue what is happening in the shop. When I complained the man behind the counter basically shushed me like this was normal for him. I decided to leave and spend my money in another restaurant that was clean and comfortable to eat in. The man behind the counter kept calling out for me to wait and come back. Little does he know that I was the person who called to ask if they deliver. It's a shame, the guy who skipped me in the line probably spent $3. However, I was planning to spend much more than the imbecile who decided to sneak in front of me. I will not step foot or spend my money in this shop. Do not recommend this place to anyone who lives in Williamsburg!",
