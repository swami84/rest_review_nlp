I have returned upwards of 10 times in the past 2 years, and it would be way more if I hadn't moved to Utah randomly for 6 months.  I can confidently say I have had basically every dish they offer at the restaurant, mostly because I had my birthday dinner there once with my family and we ordered literally one of everything on the menu (except the cheese plate) during the course of that dinner. My dad still talks about the time he ordered 14/15 items at a restaurant.  They just do seafood perfectly. Everything is fresh, no flavor overpowers the other, and the prices are incredible. The portion sizes are fair, and the service is friendly. My only complaint about upstate is that it doesn't comply better with my work schedule, because I would go far more often if I could hit the happy hour timing during the week.  On my last visit (yesterday, first time back from Utah yay!), I split with the boyfriend a dozen oysters, salmon tartare, crab cakes, lobster ceviche, fettuccine with clams and that deeeelicious whiskey cake. It was the best meal I've had in a long time, and I'm looking to replicate it soon to make up for the lost months (as I will now refer to them).  Thanks for being you, upstate. See you VERY soon!",
