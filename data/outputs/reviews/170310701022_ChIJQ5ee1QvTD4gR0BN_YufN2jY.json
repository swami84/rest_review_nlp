We both shared the cheese combo plate. The cheeses we picked were good but literally we only had a bite or 2 each. It had to be the smallest cheese plate I have ever had. Next we had the suya beef because the written description sounded so good. The taste was awful!! It tasted like leather and we both took a bite and could not eat it. I asked to return it immediately. Lastly, we tried the angus beef sliders. No flavor or sauce to add. It was the driest slider I have ever had. My friend actually joked that it didn't taste like beef but tasted like horse. We had a nice laugh though over our meal. We ended up having to spend more money elsewhere to eat as we were still super hungry after our poor choices and did not want to pay more to them for bad food. Also they do not have any type of risotto!! Huge disappointment since it is on their online menu.  The plus parts would be the server, he was super smily and friendly and the 3oz wine pours. Still pricey but they have a good selection of wines. For that 2 stars is given instead of 1.",

They have a large variety of ramen options and are also reasonably priced (not like many other places that charge around $16 a bowl).  Tip: Try the gyoza appetizer.",
