Each came with fried rice and a spring roll.  (The menu offered either plus a can of soda, but they gave us both since we didn't want the soda.)  Everything was well-prepared with just the right amount of spicing.  The tofu came well-dehydrated in a wonderful, thick soy sauce; this suggests that the tofu was fried very quickly at high temperature with soy sauce.  I've never seen tofu, included that which I cook myself, turn out so well.  The three meals were served in rigid (not foam) clam-shell containers that could be washed and re-used.  Total cost for pickup and before tip was $21.52. Their delivery charge would have been $1.50.",

I had called in for delivery  and the driver instead of coming straight up to the suite after delivering it after my lunch break told me to go downstairs to get it from the curb. I told him I was at work and my lunch break was over. Then driver came up and went to wrong door and call me on my cell phone yelling at me to come out that he had my food and didn't want to get a ticket since it was going to be my fault. I should of listened to my co workers who vowed never to order from them again since it also had made them sick and they even told me that they serve old rice (that's how it tasted) Made me sick not even 2 hours later it sent me to the bathroom. My other co worker who ordered it lost her appetite since we got it late took it home to eat and the next day told me that it also made her sick.",
