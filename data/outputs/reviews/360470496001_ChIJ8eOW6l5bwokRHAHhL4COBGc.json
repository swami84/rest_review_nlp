Well let me tell you folks, Halal xpress IS great, and the food came XPRESSS. I ordered the exotic Hakka chili chicken, and it had the perfect amount of spice, meat to rice ratio, and an exquisite texture. I also ordered the pepper onion beef fried rice, which pleasantly satiated my appetite. Having halal options is hard to find. Having good halal options is even harder. I am so happy that I discovered this fine establishment and I look forward to ordering from here in the very near future.",

I ordered a basil chicken with fried rice, and two other orders. When I inquired about if they include broccoli with the chicken they said no but they could add it for an extra dollar. So I said yes to that. 3-4 other people came in after us, ordered their food and left before we got ours even though we ordered before, and I kept making excuses in my head. We didn\u2019t complain or rush them and they apologized about the long wait. I noticed one of the workers in the kitchen holding the frozen dumplings in his bare hands instead of with gloves on. Still made an excuse for that in my head. (!) Anyway we FINALLY get our order, check if the boxes are the right amount and went home and then I see that I have white rice with my basil chicken with just three pieces of the broccoli that they wanted an extra dollar for. Majority of that dish was onion and water chestnuts. And NO fried rice like ordered. Given that I was patient and didn\u2019t rush them to hurry with the order, I can\u2019t understand why they\u2019d mess up our order under no pressure. It didn\u2019t taste good either because it was very dry.  Unfortunately this is the FOURTH time something like this happened with their business and that\u2019s why I\u2019m actually commenting like this today. Not only did I waste a lot of time waiting but you guys couldnt even give me the correct order when I\u2019m paying you for the service.  You guys lost a real customer cause I eat a lot\ud83d\ude15 and my whole family gave up on this business a long while ago because of your  negligence.",

When they're overwhelmed with customer orders they can't handle it. Ordered chicken broccoli and the chicken was disgusting and rubbery-not cooked obviously/Raw! This is wrong, just don't take the orders or give customers a reasonable pickup time when there are a lot of orders to fill! Also, ever since they hired the Chinese people to run their restaurant the food has just changed in general and so has the service. You don't get the same amount of rice when you order rice like you did when the place first opened (containers have downgraded a size so you might have to order more rice) Smh. It was better before. Now I think people just come here cause its 'halal'.  Beside that the food isn't worth the hype. It was flavorful before.  ------------------------------------------- Initial review::  First off- this is not Bangladeshi style Chinese food. It's regular style Chinese food that is halal. Just tried this place & got my food to go! I ordered a large chicken broccoli, Chicken Corn Soup, chicken rolls and shrimp rolls. The portion is generous, lots of rice! The chicken was well done (no 'bad pieces' of chicken-we're very picky about that!). They listened to all my requests about how I like my food. If your ordering here for the first time and want your food a specific way-make sure to tell them when ordering so you leave no room for disappointment. (Btw we only waited 10 or so minutes for our food after we ordered).  They just opened they're restaurant last week- so give them a chance to become \"Perfect\". Their doing great so far seeing that it has only been one week!  I've added pictures of their menu! Prices are fair like any other Chinese spot- but best of all it's halal, and this place rolled out just in time for Ramadan. Will be visiting this place often!  *they have an ATM inside *Minimum $12 on card *Minimum $12 for free delivery *HALAL *Parking street directly in front of restaurant is metered, but if you go around the surrounding blocks you can find free street parking.",

And that something hard to come by for an American Chinese restaurant on my list. I loved ordering my chicken wing and fries from the nearby Chinese restaurant once a month. The quality at this place is something out of the world. I have not seem chicken wing the size they have. I hated container they use thou which is not recyclable. Where are the old days when they use paper bag for the wings? Anyway I plan to go back again next day to make sure.  I have not tried other food here yet but one day I will order a lunch special with maybe egg roll. Price is a bit higher than other places by like one dollar and they charge tax. This place is brightly lite unlike other places. You can feel it's clean here and so will be the food.  Service is decent. I cant complain. If it's busy, you need to expect a line and some what lesser friendly staff. To be honest, I will rate them friendly than 99 percent of the Chinese service staffs.",
