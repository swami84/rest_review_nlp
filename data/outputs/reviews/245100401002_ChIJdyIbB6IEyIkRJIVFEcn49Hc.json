I called out serveal times before someone came and they said they needed 8 more minutes until it was ready. I went to sit in my car and came back in 15 minutes later. No one has greeted me yet, they just keep peeping at me and saying nothing. This is the absolute WORST! Mind you, I'm 7 months pregnant and waiting on them to finally bring out the food. The order was supposed to be ready at 3:17pm, it is now 3:43pm. Smh.",

I was amazed at ease of getting in line has become of this feature by Yelp! Kudos to the Yelp team !!!  We had a bit of a wait but it was a Saturday night dinner and that was to be expected.  Well we started off our dinner with sharing a Sambussa which was served with a spicy chili sauce. It was completely different from either the Indian or the Burmese samosa and having it with the chili sauce was ah-mazing!!! Fresh warm, not too oily or heavy on the spices. We both loved it and it was gone with a flash!  There was a nip in the air and we were looking for some warm to drink. So my better half ordered the Spiced Ethiopian Tea - another fantastic find!! And perfect for the weather. We both loved the taste of all spices that come through with each sip. We will come back for this itself. And next time try the Ethiopian coffee and the honey wine!  Finally we ordered the vegetarian combo platter. Photos will tell the rest of the story. But in summary, fresh , wholesome and enough for more than two!!! And the Injeera bread was to die for!!!  Now about the service , all of them from our usher to the order taker to the server , all were very very friendly, attentive. They create this inviting atmosphere that is a sure draw for customers like me .  And then We met Zuru, the owner is his mother and he himself is the ever smiling, soft spoken and looking for ways to please his customers. He only adds to the charm of this restaurant and I would love to meet him again, the next I am here!  And that will be real soon !!",
