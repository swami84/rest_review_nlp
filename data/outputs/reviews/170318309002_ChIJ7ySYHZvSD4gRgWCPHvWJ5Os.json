You can\u2019t talk or order from the sushi chefs!!!!  This restaurant doesn\u2019t understand how to serve people. The person that takes your order it\u2019s not the same person that brings your order. If they get busy it\u2019s chaos.  My order went to a different table because they just dropped it off without any questions so the people that sat at the table ate it without any questions   I had to actually walk to the front of the restaurant get up off of my seat \u2014do that and say where is my salad she was busy taking orders that were coming in the door why wasn\u2019t the manager doing that lazy person -pre-Madonna.  There\u2019s a manager there that just walks around and asks people how they\u2019re doing but he\u2019s not helping the servers\u2014-/that\u2019s a pre-Madonna get rid of that person and redo the whole situation. Chef Ramsey would\u2019ve Had a real problem with the operation  If someone else wasn\u2019t going to be paying for my dinner I would\u2019ve walked out 6:55 minutes past my order of a glass of wine and a glass of green tea iced tea that never got delivered until 10 minutes later",

I\u2019m from the east coast and have eaten sushi all over the country (including both coasts for the sushi snobs reading this) and the sushi here is very fresh and very flavorful (and also inventive?) My favorite is the p\u2019dodo. I\u2019ve also had the mini egg rolls-very light and crispy with a good, slightly spicy sauce. The house salad was very fresh with the typical Japanese house salad dressing. My boyfriend who is very very picky about food in general (especially sushi) loved this place even though we have completely different tastes. He liked the dragon roll best. He loves spicy food but also said that although this roll wasn\u2019t the spiciest, the flavor was so so good that he\u2019s get it again(never heard him say that before). He also really loved the spicy edamame (he gets edamame everywhere) and enjoyed the spicy miso soup.",

The food was amazing, the waiter was very relaxed and knew to give us space but was also attentive. The rolls were delicious and the wait time was minimal. However, with almost nobody else in the restaurant, we were finishing off our drinks before heading out, and all we could hear was the (what we assume) cook talking about pushing us out and we aren\u2019t making them anymore money. The waiter who was very cool told him to be quiet and be nice, but the cook just kept going at it. Trust me, we got up and left. However, what a crappy way to wrap up what was otherwise a fantastic meal. We both agreed we would want the food again but we wouldn\u2019t want to deal with that guy, and living 40 minutes away it was unlikely we\u2019d would be ordering take out. It\u2019s unfortunate but customers typically remember the beginning and end of their experience the most vividly, and this was definitely an negative end to our experience.",

This seemed like a good enough place to try out after I looked at the reviews. Ordered a couple Rainbow Rolls, octopus, salmon, etc. Food came rather quick. It was good, but most of it tasted like it had been in a refrigerator for a rather long time making them either chewy or tough. The sauce the threw in was a bonus and helped give me a better experience. At the time I ordered delivery it didn't state that they already threw in some sauce with the order so I ended up ordering extra sauce for no reason then dumped it all after I was done.  You get about 2-3 pieces of meat per order so it might seem pricey, but its good nonetheless. If I can't find a better sushi place this'll be my go to spot.",
