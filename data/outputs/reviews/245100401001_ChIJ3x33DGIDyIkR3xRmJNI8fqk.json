Paid $75 for the disgusting food and literally the worse customer service. The person (Tony) was nice. Then the food, My stomach started hurting after I ate because my pizza and the chicken I ordered was burned and I will post that so that the manager can see and tell his chef to cook the food instead of burning it since I ate my stomach has been hurting. Never going there again seriously! Very disappointed with the lady at the main counter and the food. I was so excited to try this place and I regret going there and spending so much money for nothing.",

Has great views of the harbor out the 5th story window and views of the \"mall\" over the balcony. That just-for-fun classy stop had a good port and a great deep chocolate desert with the youthful/nonclassy name Chocolate Revenge. The sight of the quiet bar added to the classy dessert stop experience. Every once in a while, you gotta go somewhere classy, and you can still have fun.",

Steak was chewy and did not taste the way local farm to table meat should taste.  Crabcake was burnt and surrounded by more burnt stuff. Flavor of the crab was terrible considering location. I mean nothing crab related should be bad in Baltimore. Crab cakes at Ruby Tuesday are much better and their crab comes out of cans.

Also I don't think I saw the waitress smile more then once.  Update: after an hour and a half, we finally got our salads and soups. They won me over. Crab soup is fantastic. It did however come luke warm, but it's great.  Double update: I have no words. Back down to 1 star, if I could do zero I would. Finally after 2 and a half hours we get our food. I got the flank steak with a side of pasta. The pasta was like mush, literally tasted like canned spaghetti. The steak was completely over cooked and felt like a leather shoe. The balsamic vinigar they put on it tasted of acid and sourness. Maybe if we weren't a big party, it would be somewhat better, but our experience was terrible, and we left unsaticfied and hungry because barely anyone ate there food.

Everyone is very polite and it has a friendly mood. You ca  tell that their food is well made and not cheap. The only thing I would say is that it is a bit expensive.",

        "caption": "Located on the 5th floor of the Renaissance Marriott with fantastic views of the inner harbor and a great breakfast buffet with a made to order omelette station plus great house coffee. What more could you ask for.  The buffet, with coffee (included in the price) was about $20.00 a person. Not bad for downtown area hotel restaurant and for the convenience and quality - very good! The fruit section was great with very fresh tasting and visually appealing produce. The scrambled eggs were light and fluffy and all the meats (bacon, Turkey bacon, chicken and regular sausage) were moist and juicy with  an adequate selection of breads and pastries.  They have a chef station to build your own omelette so you can always customize it to the way you want it.  We ate here on two separate occasions and both times the service was phenomenal. Our server was so friendly, helpful and courteous, most of all it was genuine, she deserves to be recognized (De'Zsa & Timothy) . I would definitely eat here again.",
