Our server was a true professional and helped us understand an extensive wine list with some unfamiliar terms (for me, a novice). He did not guide us wrong. We ordered off the salami menu, got two pastas, and shared a main dish. This was a perfect amount of food. The tagliatelli dish with lamb was the highlight for me. Just awesome down to the last detail. For dessert, our server brought us a Panna cotta - which i didn't expect to enjoy - but it was fantastic!! A great way to close out a meal (and settle the stomach). I don't write a ton of reviews, but this restaurant left an impression!.. and took every precaution for covid which is greatly appreciated. Highly recommend. Enjoy.",

Both cooked to perfection. I loved the wine reduction sauce with my venison and swiss shard. I don't like shard but loved it tonight.  Tonight's front expertise was outstanding as well. Parrish recommended a Italian Cab that was so outstanding we asked where we can buy another for our own collection.  Highly recommend and will return again in the future.  Delaneys",

Service was ok but not up to par for this restaurant. The wrong dish was delivered to one of my guests but no one noticed. We had all started eating and they brought out another dish that apparently was the right one. They swapped her meal but without much apology or acknowledgement  of the mistake. It was handled poorly and in my experience if a service driven establishment makes a mistake they typically offer a verbal apology at a minimum. Might try again but with a lower stakes scenario.",

I also asked a woman who wasn't our server for salt (because our server was serving a bottle of wine to another table and I didn't want my food getting cold) and she gave me a rude look as if I should be asking my server that. As for the food, I ordered the seafood squid ink spaghetti and while the flavor was delicious, the shellfish was rubbery and I was only given about 5 pieces of it, 2 shrimp and 3 calamari rings. The desserts were pretty lazy as well. I think they used restaurant week as an excuse to cut corners when this is a time to attract new clients.",

We normally sit at the bar and chat with the staff, but we normally just get wine and light fare (not even a full meal). I suppose we tip pretty well, but it must be comparatively low to couples who get dinner. So based on all of that, I can't imagine why we get such special treatment.  And then it hit me.  We don't.  That's just how exceptional Tony and his staff are.  You don't normally expect a high end restaurant to have the welcoming ambiance of a corner bar.  But that's the culture here. I can't name many restaurants in the city that get it all right. Cinghiale is one for sure.",

We werena party of 4 (with a birthday guest) and every dish was just incredible and perfectly paired with the right wine. The evening seemed to go by fast, but we did not feel rushed at all.

My group started with the bruschetta as our appetizer; it had no flavour.  Their twist on the dish added goat cheese which was utterly bland.  The tomato and zucchini topping also had no flavour.  A dash of salt, some fresh basil or even some balsamic vinegar would have made a world of difference.  The main dishes were ok.  I will grant that we were a later dinner party, but still plenty of time before closing.  The dish I had, duck ragu if I remember, the noodles were undercooked to the point they were chewy.",

In my opinion, duck is way better than steak. Although I was not a fan of the side of mushrooms in a balsamic reduction, everything else turned out fantastic. Not to mention their deserts are out of this world. Over all AMAZING food, great service and lovely atmosphere. I definitely will be a returning guest. I absolutely loved my experience! Cingahiale is an outstanding, one of a kind restaurant and I highly recommend making this place your next date night.",

We've dined in both the formal dining room and the enoteca and enjoy the enoteca a lot more; you get the same level of service, but it feels a little more laid back. The menu consists of two prix fixe menus - a slightly smaller ~$30 option, and a full-blown $60+ option; however, you can also order dishes a la carte. Obviously pasta is going to be what a lot of people focus on for an Italian restaurant (and it is quite good) but don't sleep on some of the other options, including the charcuterie and the bronzino. I also recommend brushing up on your wine if you're so inclined, since the wine list is extensive. For the level of service and the quality of the food and drink, I think I Cinghiale is an absolute steal.",

Accommodating of all dietary restrictions, even gluten on a menu with tons of pasta! all things can be made with a vegetarian stock, very little dairy is used as a staple in a dish, and the food is phenomenal. pasta is made fresh daily and the menu changes every day as well. the wine list is an extensive homage to Italian wine, moving through the entire country, region by region. Tuesdays are 12 price wine nights and you can try some stellar bottles that might be daunting at full price, but feel accessible at a discount (time to try that new wine that you don't know and not your tried and true) Amazing Salumeria which is charcuterie, and it is located between the 2 dining rooms so you can stop by and ask questions and taste a few things, it's encouraged! there are 2 pre fixe menu options so you can dine in courses and try something from each part of the menu. the nonna menu is 3 courses with classic dishes and a homey, family feel (it's literally grandma's menu) and the other is a 4 course menu that allows you to try some of the large plate options on the menu like the Hudson valley magret of duck or the crispy skin on rockfish, as well as a small portion of pasta, antipasti and dessert. Or you can order a la carte. great place to spend an evening and not just a fine dining establishment, the service will always be top notch, but it's accessible, just as great for a regular Tuesday night dinner as it is for an amazing anniversary celebration.",

Recommend the price set menu to get a full complement of the menu. Prices are higher than other places, but are on par with the neighborhood.
