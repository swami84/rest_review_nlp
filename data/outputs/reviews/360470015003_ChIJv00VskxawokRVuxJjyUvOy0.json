Forward many many years later, I have beenfortunate enough to receive at least two gift packages from my brother for me and my daughter. I have also sent gift packages to dear friends as a very special gift. Katz's Deli offers different packages with classic Jewish offerings. I have had their matzo ball soup which will cure anything from the common cold to the flu.The matzo balls are fluffy and flavorful. My daughter even liked them better than mine. The pastrami was wonderful. Sliced perfectly against the grain, thick and flavorful, makes the perfect sandwich topped with the epic mustard from the deli. The pickles were amazing. Crunchy and boosting that perfect sour flavor are the perfect compliment to the luscious pastrami. The knishes are so tasty and filling. Baked to a crisp crust, they are just fantastic. And of course you must have dessert. The babka was just outstanding. Layers of flaky pastry with chocolate swirls were just melt in your mouth deliciousness. I also loved the apron that comes in this gift package. I have sent gift packages and the tee shirts are wonderful.Any gift package that you order from Katz's Deli comes straight from Kat's Deli. They do not go through any 3rd party organization.  When a company has been in business since 1888, there are many reasons. Location to a community that services their type of cuisine is very important. Secondly the food must be superb and consistently superb, which of course is Katz's Deli. And lastly it must have wonderful customer service. This is Katz's Deli to the max. They go to the sky to make sure every order is perfect and if not, correct it without hesitation. This is how Katz's Deli has been around since 1888 and I hope for many many more years to come.",

She acknowledged I was friendly too and knew I must be from out of town, LOL. The sandwich is expensive but worth it since I'm not in NYC often and the quality of pastrami with the fatty cuts are the best I've had. Watching the cutters slice the meat and lay it out on the bread like a spread out deck of cards was satisfying. Since it was around the corner from my hotel it was easier for me to go here than the regular spot.",

Dam now i have to find my father's pastrami spot in Manhattan around 50 th st on the west side. There they pull out the pastrami from a hot steamy bath and cut it on the slicer and it be nice and tender and hot. The only thing i enjoy was the 12oz pepsi and the green pickle with the mustard.

And I know that if I was at the counter at the original location, speaking to the person making my sandwich, maybe even getting a couple of slices as a pre-game taste, may be even tipping that person at the counter, there is NO CHANCE I would have received the same sub-par pastrami that I got in the food court location.

Also, they ask you for a tip of either 5, 10 or 15 percent as you are placing your order, so you might wonder if not tipping means a 'sad' sandwich. I'll gladly tip well in a restaurant and, of course, after a meal not before, so I find this whole setup strange, but that's just me.",
