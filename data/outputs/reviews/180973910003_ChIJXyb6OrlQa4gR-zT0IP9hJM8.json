The food, without question, stole the show.  If you are reading this, the restaurant is usually available to members only.  I\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019ll be open to the public, so take advantage of this while you can.  View \u2013 Best in the city Atmosphere \u2013 Elegant, up to date Service \u2013 Topnotch, start to finish.  Chef came out, GM checked on us and our waitress was fantastic Drinks \u2013 Nice selection, started with champaign and then each had a cocktail \u2013 I went with a Manhattan and my wife enjoyed a Peach Cosmo FOOD \u2013 Skyline Brussels Sprouts, Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Asian Grilled Lamb Chops, Crushed Potatoes.  The brussels sprouts were quite possibly the best I\u2019ve ever had\u2026and when on any menu, I order.  Cooked to perfection with a chili honey glaze spread over goat cheese.  The crushed potatoes were delicious but as the only basic item ordered, got lost in the shuffle.  We brought most of the potatoes home as leftovers and created a breakfast dish the next day that was phenomenal.  As far as the main courses, we haven\u2019t stopped talking about them.  The Pan Seared Sea Scallops dish was incredible and the thoughtfulness of the plating and pairings with corn puree, risotto, bacon and blackberry reduction made it memorable.  The surprise of the night came with the Asian Grilled Lamb Chops.  No words can do this justice and I thank the waitress for introducing this as a popular selection.  Soy glazed with stir fried veggies and a cilantro mint sauce.  3 lamb chop lollipops, which can\u2019t be an easy item to properly cook, were handled by the chef with perfection.  I\u2019ve ordered this dish from a few high-end restaurants and have never left a review or raved to friends about the experience.  We\u2019ve been fortunate to dine at some great restaurants and we both agree, this is now a favorite.  Do yourself a favor and take in the views of the city, enjoy a cocktail and trust the Chef and his team to handle the rest.",

The ambience inside the restaurant was average. If you go during closing time the servers near your table might talk too loud about how they are not their to make friends but to make money making you uncomfortable or probably wanting to leave early thinking you probably might be getting in their way or stopping them from leaving to home sweet home. Our waitress was very sweet though. She got the chef to make custom made vegetarian risotto for me and kept a good check on how we were doing during the entire evening.",

Received a phone call ~3pm Saturday afternoon informing me they had \"no more slots available for 7, but they would do 8\" even though my reservation was confirmed on Friday for 7pm Saturday. Upon arrival at 8pm, the hostess paraded my son and I through the entire dining room, only to laugh and say she had no idea where to seat us since she did not see a table reserved in our name (even though I saw our name written in the book for 8pm). After finding someone to seat us, she simply walked away without apology. Our meals were another letdown... we both ordered the herbed tenderloin cooked Medium Rare (cool red center), but both were served Medium (warm, barely pink center). I requested my meal replaced, cooked as ordered; the plate that returned was less than appetizing. The meat was correct, but the presentation was horrendous. Both my son and I ordered creme brulee... just as disappointing as the rest of the meal, the curdled consistency and chemical taste was unpalatable. When I brought it to our server's attention, she simply removed the offensive dishes and left our bill. I was surprised to see a 20% \"Service Fee\" already figured into the total, but downright offended when there was a place to add an additional amount. The view and our server, Kyla, are the only decent take-aways from a $120+ meal. Severely disappointed. Will NOT return.",

Initially the customer service was great all emails were answered very timely and all questions answered. I got slammed at work so my fianc\u00e9 went to tour alone where the person was over 20 minutes late and stated they called the number on file, I never received one call. Secondly, we never got a follow up call or email thanking us or discussing how we pay so we emailed thanking them for the tour and to move forward. Never got a follow up call or email after a week went by realized they were never going to follow up. I hate saying this, but having attended several events there, it\u2019s hard not feeling discriminated against. We have friends and families who are ClubCorp members and we will continue to share are experience, because this is not okay. We were paying customers just like everyone else ready to write a check that day and were immediately dismissed. Very disappointed in Skyline Club and have no plans of returning.",

I was in Indy this past week at a convention and figured I would just see if there was anything around having some time to kill. I was really pleased to see The Skyline Club and ventured into town last night. It was a little late but figured a glass of wine or two and check out the view. When I got to the club, I realized that I didn't have my card with me. The staff was very helpful and didn't even flintch. Me and my guest were served immediately and despite in the process of closing, didn't rush us out either. Very professional staff and wish I had the bartenders name to thank him publicly here for an exceptional experience.",

Looking into sunset as our choices were to look out a filthy window or close the curtains completely.  Such a shame windows so dirty as would have been a nice view.

We got off the elevator and were greeted by a friendly hostess. It was a clear night and we were very happy to be given a table near the window, overlooking the city. What a great view! The food was delicious, the service was prompt, the place was clean. Overall, a very nice place, although the atmosphere reminded me more of a wedding hall than a fine dining establishment. However, not to be a restaurant snob, but for the price, there was one major expectation that fell short. When we've eaten at other places, for example Ocean Club or St. Elmo's, (similar in price), the waiter was very knowledgeable of the items included on the menu as well as being able to recommend potential wine pairings. Wait staff at other places have allowed my wife and I enjoy the creations of the chefs, and learn about foods or preparation methods we hadn't known about previously. At other nice restaurants and clubs, it's not uncommon for the owner or chef to personally visit our table to ask how we are doing.  This adds to the overall experience of dining out (not eating out). Although Skyline Club wait staff were very prompt and the food came on time, one course right after another, the lack of interaction and menu knowledge of the wait staff prior to the meal left me feeling like I was just \"eating out\" and my perceived value was lower than the level that would allow me to recommend going back or recommend Skyline Club to my friends.",
