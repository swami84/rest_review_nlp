I was given chicken with broccoli.  they rectified it rather quickly (why the one star) but then after we were essentially almost done with our meal, there was a nasty and large cockroach in the chicken and mixed vegetables.  It was nasty.  I immediately contacted the restaurant, told them to pick up the food, and demanded $$ back.  The guy came back, took the food, but was only willing to reimburse us for the chicken and broccoli.  So not only do they give us a dish with a cockroach (which means that the place is infested), but they refuse to reimburse us.  Never, ever going back there.  Recommend no one else does as well.  Will be reporting them to the NYC DOH and will dispute the charge on my card.",
