Enjoyed how strong the drinks were, but maybe avoid them if you\u2019re a lightweight and don\u2019t want to get drunk after one. They had cute little bags to put your mask in and had a QR code for their menu on it though they still had paper menus they\u2019d give out.  Also it was funny that it was about 7 degrees out so they had a heater near the door pointed into the restaurant to keep the draftiness down and one patron decided she wanted the heater only on her so everyone else got bursts of arctic air which provided another topic of conversation, thanks lady!",

This is unacceptable.  In addition, my attempts to reach someone in regards to this personal breech of information has been ignored. So I then attempted.to contact upper management and found Suzi Craft had made a comment on the main facebook page. So I sent her a private message to please call me. Instead, she.chose to block me. They are also deleting my reviews on their facebook page. So, now i am.choosing to go public with this. Its not so much about the bad experience it happens and its water under the bridge,  its absolutely about the fact that they shared my full name to a employee Christopher Lee who then contacts me.on facebook under false pretense.

The staff was so nice and accommodating and I really enjoyed the typical French, romantic atmosphere--it did  remind me of being back in Paris. I had the Goat Cheese Tart and the Beef tartare -- both were delicious and a generous portion. For dessert I had the Floating Island with an Americano (big points for having an espresso machine on hand!). Cocktails I tried were the Parisian, a perfect aperitif and the Brasserie Old Fashioned which was a nice twist on a classic. I honestly felt like the prices were on the cheaper side for what I was getting. Definitely  a great value. Gina was my server and did a wonderful job and although I didn't catch the manager's name, she was on point. I will definitely be back and bring my husband along next time. This is the perfect spot for date night--even if it's just yourself!",

I got an iron-skillet roast/seared chicken dish that was absolutely amazing and will definitely order again in the future. Their complementary bread is addictive, and their bacon salad is sublime. The staff here was very good and did an excellent job making sure our dining experience was one to remember. A bit expensive compared to other St. Louis offerings (salad was $14, entree was $26) Brasserie makes for a great special occasion venue. Highly recommended.",

I got the Beignets Which comes with dried plums and lemon curd. For the sides I got frites which comes with the garlic aioli. Beignets were really good, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Frites were very crispy and I love the garlic aioli. The Beignets size could be smaller it's a lot for 1 person to eat. Overall everything was really good.",

The staff are impeccable, the menu is quite French and a nice indulgent change of pace, and the food preparation is a bit hit-or-miss, in my limited experience.

On NYE (they may have been overwhelmed) the braised beef was in an overpoweringly salty sauce, the trout was a bit underwhelming, the mousse was ok with a rather bitter biscuit in it. The bread, sourced from a local bakery, was fantastic. Crowding can be an issue, it's so popular. If people don't clear out after eating it can interfere with later  reservations.",

The cocktails were not properly balanced and with the normal \u201crestaurant ice\u201d added, it was a diluted muddled practically undrinkable experience.  We left our table after dinner and went to the bar for a different experience and upon inquiry for the rye used in the Sazarec, I was told dewar\u2019s....I don\u2019t even know how to respond to that.  I would contemplate going back because the food, ambience and service were good but just avoid the cocktail list entirely.",

It's a truly special restaurant, and my favorite for good reason. I tend to go alone, but when I don't, I only bring very close friends, and enjoy watching their eyes light up when they sample any of the breathtaking items on the menu. The short answer: go to Brasserie.",

First of all I love the beer selection, it had plenty of different types of beers and some I've never heard of so I tried the Civil Life The Angel and the Sword (I love all things Civil Life), and the Octoberfest.  For Starter we ordered the Fromage which is a tray of various breads and cheeses. I've never had tasted anything quite like the cheese, but it tasted very rich and tangy, we loved the unique flavors.  For mains, my girlfriend had ordered the Scallop dish that came with potatoes and I ordered the Steak with fries plus an order of Mac and Cheese.  All of the dishes were amazing but the Mac and Cheese knocked my socks off. wow.  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and her scallops were top notch.  We loved our experience here.  It was a perfect way to celebrate our anniversary. Thank you Brasserie!",

The menu had a lot of options & the food was excellent -- as was the service.  My wine-by-the-glass was a red blend that had a silken mouth feel and was absolutely delicious (Grenache-Mourv\u00e8dre-Syrah).  My daughter had the grapefruit mocktail and it was quite good as well.  And the desserts were wonderful.  Word to the wise:  Do NOT miss the goug\u00e8res -- if I lived anywhere near this restaurant, I would be ordering them to go at least once a week!",

Last night we began with the fris\u00e9e salad, which was beautifully presented with a perfectly cooked poached egg atop. I had the sea scallops, which were also cooked to perfection and paired with citrus and shallots - magnificent. My hubs had his go-to: the chicken, which is arguably the best chicken dish you will ever have. We had the chocolate mousse (with the house\u2019s compliments) and a scoop of homemade ice cream for dessert. Magical from start to finish!  What separates Brasserie from the rest is the service that the team delivers. Jennifer, the GM, treats us like family every time we come in. Melinda, the bar GM, is equally warm, hospitable, and a lot of fun to converse with when we are at the bar with her. The waiters and waitresses take pride in the work they do, and they operate as one unified team - an indicator of great leadership at the helm.  Go to Brasserie, and you will never be disappointed!",

Not typical beignet)Brioche french toast - (8 of 10. Another great dish. It is very moist. Long bath? I prefer my French toast on the crispy crunch side but this is not it. But still well done taste. But the whipped lemon curd pushed this to the top not even needing syrup.) French breakfast- looks like cheese board but was told very good (7 of 10)Brisket tartine (10 of 10 if they could make this better I do not know how. Brisket is better than most bbq joints so moist and flavorful. Bread gives it texture. Arugula amazing pepper flavor. Plus everything else. Amazing dish)Onion soup - 9 of 10 it's done to perfection only mark down is size options lil small.",

Well, Gerard Kraft's Brasserie by Niche deserves 6 stars! Kraft is an award-winning chef and has created other outstanding restaurants in the St. Louis area, so it should surprise no one that his new Brasserie continues the trend. But Brasserie by Niche is not just \"echt\" French cuisine; they have captured the ambience and the attitude as well. If you have dined in Paris brasseries in the past, you'll probably be snobby and say this isn't quite authentic. But from fresh pat\u00e9s, smooth gratin\u00e9e (soupe \u00e0 l'oignon) and fresh locally sourced meats, vegetables and cheeses, Brasserie is the best St. Louis/French cooking on this side of the Atlantic. Wines are great too--nothing out of reach, but still top-notch reds and whites. Didn't have room for dessert (next time), but the mousse au chocolat and the profit\u00e9roles looked beautiful. All in all, a stellar meal.",

The food was extremely fresh and tasted amazing. The server was very kind, professional, and encouraged us to take our time. There is not a parking structure but street parking is available. Outside looks very charming but can be easily missed. Overall, I had a great experience.",

The food is a bit too buttery and I think the menu could be more interesting, especially for a \"French\" restaurant. It seems very \"wannabe nice restaurant\" and if you've been to good restaurant in NYC, Chicago or even Cleveland you'll be disappointed.  Most people won't notice this, and maybe I got unlucky, but the dishes had a terrible smell.  The glasses, the utensils and the plates all had this smell.  I noticed this it during he meal but figured it was something in the air until I got a good wiff of the silverware during dessert, so if you've got a sensitive noise I would be wary of this place.

There were so many nuances like plush bench seats to small creamer holders. The staff seem to really enjoy working where they do which is always comforting.  Now, this is not some where I could afford as student to numerous mimosas or turn up on a Sunday. The price range is higher but its worth it because of the quality.
