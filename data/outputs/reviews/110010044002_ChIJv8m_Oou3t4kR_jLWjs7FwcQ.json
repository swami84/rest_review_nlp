Food is ordered via the app and payment is made after each order is placed, so pay after each round of drinks etc...  Servers just come out and drop off the food and leave.  The first time we went was in November and my crew thought the hostess was  unfriendly because of how strict she was when explaining the rules, but I wrote it off to early stages of cold weather pandemic, so just cautious. I went  this month with 2 friends and same structure and I think the same hostess.  They have a 2 hour dining limit and they warn you 20 minutes before your time is up.  We had a 6pm-8pm reservation and she approached us at  7:50pm and said \"I need you to leave the table now\" because she seated the first person at 5:50pm.  We left what food was on our plate and half full glasses of wine.  When I approached her on the way out that we still had 10 minutes and could have finished our food and wine she stuck to her rule that 2 hours started at 5:5pm and gave a flippant sorry and would you like to us pour your wine back in the bottle and take it with you. She then  turned towards the bar and rolled her eyes. We probably spent $200 and walked out pretty ticked off that we couldn't finish the wine and she wouldn't reseat us at one of the other patio tables that were empty.  Food is pretty good, but not enough to warrant the treatment from the hostess.  That type of treatment of customers can only be achieved at the best restaurants in DC.",

The ambiance is unique-- you feel like you've left the city and entered a private garden- which I assume is what they're going for. The only thing that I would say is that I wish they had more food options for vegans. The mushroom toast was good, but if it's the only option that I can order, I'm not going to hurry back considering ordering food is mandatory. I also wish we had more personalized service as everything is done through an app due to COVID, so I couldn't express this to anyone when I was there. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my visit and understand we are living in difficult times.",

The chicken sandwich and avocado lime caesar salad are also great. If you want a cocktail instead wine, I highly recommend the Est. 1930! We've been a handful of times and also gotten takeout, and they have exceeded our expectations every time.",
