Everyone of the employees here that I have encountered have been professional. They greet. Take your order. And wham...your order is ready in exactly 15 (wait time).

But then things got weird...  Last weekend, and today I've received calls from Pizza Hut delivery drivers letting me know they were on their way to my hotel (I stayed at the Hilton Atlanta for Dragon Con).  I called at 7PM, and spoke with the manager (Eric). He seemed perplexed by what was going on, and called the driver to cancel the delivery. He also mentioned refunding my credit card.  He stated another Pizza Hut must have placed the order, but I verified the number before calling and asking to speak with a manager. This was the only Pizza Hut I called in Atlanta.  I'm now working through all of my credit cards to find fraudulent charges for pizza because it was late when I placed the order on the 27th and I don't remember which card I used. This whole thing is surreal and leads to a slew of questions. - who's placing the order - how do they have my cell #, and hotel delivery information - how many other people is this happening to  Depending on what I find will determine who contacts Pizza Hut corporate (me, or my atrorneys).  It may be a glitch, or it may be more nefarious. But I urge everyone to reconsider using a credit card.",

One hour and 15 minutes later, we called to check on the pizza. We couldn\u2019t get anyone to answer the phone. At 11:30 we talked to a guy through the call center. They continuously transferred us, but no one would ever answer the phone. I never received my order. How do you take someone\u2019s order and money and not deliver the pizza? Corporate needs to look closely at this store. It\u2019s damaging to the brand. I tried calling corporate, but I hung up after waiting 20+ minutes. I\u2019ll think twice about ordering ordering from Pizza Hut. Very, very disappointing! Edited to add >> The automated response below is a joke! It\u2019s clear these problems have been an ongoing issues, and no one is aiming to resolve them. Pizza Hut, you can do better. Get these reoccurring problems resolved if you really care, and reach out to your customers to make it right. I\u2019m now even more offended.",

I paid for the pizza by phone and asked to be refunded.  The manager apologized insincerely and said she would void the transaction.  You can't void a transaction for which you have already received payment.  Now I need to contact my bank. I asked for a refund and requested a receipt as proof of refund. The manager stated  that she can only void the payment and would not be able to email a receipt.  She offered no kind of accommodation other than having the pizzas made and delivered by 11:30 A.M. Ummmm.....my students will no longer be in class at that time thus my reason for having a delivery time of 10:30 A.M.  The manager's false sense of care and lack of knowledge of how to treat a customer (for instance offering coupons or a percent off a future order) was off putting.",

My girlfriend submitted a big order for an event for her work at 9 AM (same day) online, and set the pick up time for carry out for 5:15 PM (later the same day). We arrive at the Pizza Hut location for pick up around 5:05 PM, my girlfriend pays for the order, and then we wait... for over 50 minutes!!! The manager explains to us that because it\u2019s a big order, it takes longer to complete. Ummm... what\u2019s the point of ordering in advance if the order is going to be 50+ minutes late?! In the meantime, like 4-5 other patrons come in, get their orders on time, and leave happy, while my girlfriend and I are seating there waiting and waiting and waiting. Will NEVER order from Pizza Hut again, and the manager at this location should be ashamed of himself for not keeping his workers on time. RIDICULOUS!!!",

The cook from the back came up and made sure we had all our condiments such as ranch, blue cheese and etc.  The food was hot and delicious.  Will definitely be returning.  THANKS!!!",

I called 4 times to simply place a delivery order and i was put on hold 3 different time for every person that came on the phone to ask me what my issue was after telling every single one of them what the problem was. Finally when i got that issue solved i was treated very rudely by the woman marie or something like that. Then she trlls me it will be 40 min. And here it is 1130 and im just getting my food and to ads on my food is cold and mt breadsticks are burnt. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!! The people are ignorrant and treat their customers terribly. And also when they finally arrived i was told i told them i was paying with cash and for the record i never was asked what i would be paying with. This is by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced!",

The first pizza that was sent had NO sauce at all. I called and asked for them to resend it. The next pizza they sent me was a thin crust cheese pizza with bbq sauce. I called AGAIN and they sent me a thrown together, sloppy and cold version of what I had originally asked for. After speaking with corporate online I received a pizza exactly like the first one I received, NO sauce. The manager claimed that the order said easy on the sauce, which is correct. HOWEVER. Easy on the sauce does not equate to NO SAUCE. In total I received 4 pizzas all of which were incorrect, when I asked for a refund they were not willing to do so and said they would need all of the pizzas back. In addition the manager TOLD me that the pizzas were made correctly. If you know ANYTHING about customer service you NEVER tell the customer that they are wrong and they they're pizzas were made right when they clearly were not made how they were supposed to be made. I would NEVER recommend this location and quite frankly it should be closed down completely.",

I work down the street at the hospital and we ordered food for someone's birthday at 8:00 they said that the pizza won't be delivered not even a full mile away at 10:45 we called to see where the pizza was and they said that the driver called and nobody answered. I work in the emergency room come on what do you mean nobody answered the emergency room never closes someone is always there. So we went down to the Pizza Hut and the manager and person working up front looked dumbfounded as to the order. The manager barely had anything to say but that they couldn't walk into the emergency room to see who the order was for. What the hell kind of sense does that make. The desk is all of 5 feet away from the door so you couldn't walk in and ask and walk right back out? Is someone gonna get you while you walk in the hospital where there is security and officers?? Oh ok. Then after waiting for the pizza to be remade the dumbfounded manager walks back to the front to tell me they ran out of everything they only have thin crust. It was not even 11:40 and you ran out of pizza?? You don't close until 1 am. So what are you gonna serve until then?? Right. How ridiculously unprofessional and rude and didn't even offer any type of exchange for what was initially ordered. Multiple people that I work with order from here because we work right down the street but don't worry they will hear about this nonsense and I notably other people will be ordering from here again! Y'all need to be shut down because y'all don't know how to treat people nor accommodate what is going on around them in downtown Atlanta. While your at it make sure you fix the fact that the person answering phones was yelling at customers telling them she won't give them their drink because she didn't believe he was who he said he was and let the phone ring for atleast 5 mins. Disgusting!!!!",

I called to check the status after 2 hours of placing the order. Waited 25 minutes for someone to answer. Person that answer must have just finished hitting the pipe because I saw no sign of intelligence. Long story short, I gave the guy my last name and he said the driver left with it 10 minutes ago. 1 hour later, still no pizza. I attempted to call again, waited 12 minutes and gave up. I went out to get food. Pizza never showed up. No call. No email. No refund (yet). Stay far away from this place, unless you like to gamble. This is the kind of place that will drop you food on the floor or spit in it and serve it to you.",

Whoever the manager that is in charge of this location apparently isn't doing their job. If they were, their employees wouldn't suck so bad. My fiance and I had our family members visiting us from out of town. They were here for the entire weekend and this was just one of those nights that we were too tired from our fun and eventful day. So we decided to order pizza! We ordered 4 pizzas, the delivery guy only brought us 3. The delivery guy mentioned that he would go back to the store and bring us our last pizza back. He did not! So we waited a few hours...no stupid delivery guy. We called the store at this point only to be put on hold or hung up on several times.  Eventually they stopped answering the phone and we ended up speaking to a representative at a call center. It was a MESS!!! It has been about a week and we still have not received a refund or an anything. I don't know if it was because it was the weekend and they may have been crazy busy...but our experience with this location was unprofessional. We won't be working with this location again! I wouldn't post any stars if I didn't have to. But the post requires at least one so...there you go.",

About 20 minutes after I went in, a different cashier came up, and when I asked him about the pizza, he handed it to me immediately because it turned out it was ready the whole time. I probably wouldn't recommend going there unless you enjoy dying of starvation while waiting for your food.",
