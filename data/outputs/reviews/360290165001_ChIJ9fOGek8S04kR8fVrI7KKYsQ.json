We ordered  1 x FRIDAYS\u2122 Signature Whiskey-Glazed Burger(1 x $12.29)=$12.29 1 x Medium Well 1 x Gluten-Free Bun 1 x No Cheddar 1 x Onion Rings (1 x $1.49)=$1.49 1 x Extra American Cheese (1 x $0.49)=$0.49  This order was cooked fully well done. No bacon was put on the burger even though this burger comes with bacon. and it had cheddar cheese on it instead of the American cheese we paid extra for.  we also ordered  1 x NEW! Philly Cheesesteak Burger(1 x $13.59)=$13.59 1 x Medium Well 1 x Regular Bun 1 x Seasoned Fries 1 x Bacon (1 x $1.49)=$1.49  Again, this contained no bacon even though I specifically paid extra for this.  Also, my experience picking up was not that great. I walked in and waited at the host stand for about 10 minutes, multiple servers walked by and did not even acknowledge me. eventually, I saw a sign that said pickup and take-out and proceeded to the table where food was set up for take-out services ie GrubHub, uber eats, etc. I found a bag with my name on it and grabbed it and left. a very awkward experience as anyone off the street could have come in and grabbed food. only upon exiting was I acknowledged briefly. This is confusing as there may have been like 5 guests, not exactly an overwhelmingly busy night.  after getting home and being disappointed with my meal, I immediately reached out to your restaurant and after multiple rings, I was routed to a call center, I explained my situation and was assured that the general manager would reach out to me within 48 hours to remedy the situation. a week later I called back and got the same information  If I was dining in I would have been able to resolve this issue immediately, but this situation has gone on for way longer than I should have had to endure  Finally was reached out to by the GM and told that I would receive some Discount vouchers from corporate instead of offering to refund me. I replied and have not heard back for days. I will be reaching out to corporate and see if they can take a close look at this location based on other's recent experience's I think things need to be addressed here. I do not plan on returning to this location anytime soon.",

I had a salad with steak well done (came out bloody) and my husbands pasta was cold, no appetizer came, not to mention we waited as long as we did. We gave up red flags everywhere!!! Said we would pay for our drinks that we barely drank and wanted to leave. Just expected better service all the way around.

Finally we decided to sit at the bar. The whole bar was covered in dirty glasses trash and fresh and dried sticky substances. Mind you we again we two of four people sitting at the bar at the time and the bartender couldn\u2019t be bothered to clean his bar. He didn\u2019t offer us specials or was he very friendly or attentive. We ordered and our appetizer came out after half an hour of waiting and the combo classic was all dried and over cooked like it sat under the lamp a little to long and forgotten about. Our main meal came and we were sadden to discover one meal was like warm cold in parts and the other was missing half of its ingredients now i understand being out of certain ingredients but at least inform people of that fact not just play it off like nothing. When we informed the bartender which i had to flag him down to get his attention he didn\u2019t seem to care at all and stated he knew they were out of peppers. We were asked if i we wanted to \u201ctry again\u201d we stayed no just a refund he printed a new bill said here ya go not even offering an apology about our situation and even told us to calm down when we spoke up about our disappointment  in our meals",

We then ordered 3 appetizers and a salad for me. 2 of the appetizers came out around 10 minutes after ordering which was fine. Then an additional 20 minutes for the other appetizer. Keep in mind that we were the only table there as well as another table of 3 behind us. Our waiteess went to retrieve my salad and took an additional 20 minutes. So I got it in a box to go. It took another 10 minutes to get change, that we had to hunt her down to get said change. The two waitresses are clueless and the management staff must be too in order to let this go on.",

I say only because we ended up cutting it close. Normally that would have been plenty of time at a chain restaurant. Not this time. We started off with two Cokes. Ever have straight Coke syrup? Well, now I have. It wasn't actually pure syrup, it had flat water in it too. So we had flat, sickly sweet Coke.  Delicious. I ordered their Cajun pasta, she ordered a cheeseburger. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. All of a sudden, we went from having an hour, to having 30 minutes. After waiting half an hour, in a TGI Fridays that had maybe a half dozen other people in it, the food came. Cajun pasta. Looked tasty. Its fettuccini in a creamy sauce, with res peppers, a little spicy, with chicken, and shrimp. It should be pink. It was not pink. It was brown. It looked like beef stroganoff served at a homeless shelter. The chicken was rubbery.  The dish tasted burnt. The chicken, the shrimp, the peppers, the sauce, even the pasta itself, they all had the flavor of char. How the he'll can you make pasta taste like an ashtray? The breadstick it comes with was not burned however. Probably because it came out five minute minutes after the food. I'm guessing it was the second one they cooked.  The first is probably being used to draw a picture. Her cheeseburger, ordered medium well, was well burned. Blackened. Chared. It was tough, and looked like charcoal. Her fries tasted like they were cooked hours before and reheated. It was disgusting overall. I usually don't mind these places. TGI Fridays, Ruby Tuesdays etc. Ill be avoiding this one from now on though.",

We waited for a solid 10 minutes to be seen to. The way after waving down a waitress who was stood in the back, saw me look at her to take my order. She then moved to the side to get out of view of me, as if trying to hide after I have clearly made eye contact with her. A gentleman then came to over to the table after I had to actually ask to order. However, he didn't take me order. Instead he dragged a guy who was on his break to take our order. The service was a shambles at this restaurant. I will not be returning to the place again. I have never been treated with such terrible service, and never felt so unwanted to be there.",

The 2 bartenders neither acknowledged us, offered us a drink or a menu for 45 minutes. There was a male and a female, slamming things, complaining about how the people at the door must be sending everyone to the bar, and how they didn't sign up for this. 45+ minutes for a Sprite and a draft beer, which never was offered to refill. When they did finally take our food order and it was delivered the food was good and hot, of course at that point hot food was not good because we only had 15 minutes left to eat it and get to the show on time.

We then also noticed that one of the plates was missing 2 items. We get the utensils and the food was ice cold. Had obviously been sitting for more then 20 mins. Asked to speak to manager when we told him all that was wrong he just stood there staring at us no apology no attempt to offer to make it right nothing. We walked out starving. Fiancee and I both have worked in food service for years and have never ever seen anything like this restaurant before. I would understand if the place was busy but literally there was only 3 other tables there . 2 waitresses plus manager. If they cant handle that they need some serious help at this location.",

We were okay with that so we waited. Upon seated, we haven\u2019t had a waiter/waitress for maybe another 10 minutes. Our server was nice, we can see that she was trying her best, so did every other staff on the floor, but the food was extremely slow, and they really seemed understaffed for a Friday evening. They might\u2019ve had 2 servers in the whole restaurant at the time, and they\u2019re trying their best. The food wasn\u2019t bad overall, but took way too long to come. Looks like they might have some management / staffing issue.",

Had to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated despite the restaurant was practically empty and were told there was only 1 server at the time. Took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Appetizers finally arrived at our table at 6 and at 6:30 we asked the hostess and another waiter for our entree. Needless to say we ate so fast and we're still late for the show. The table behind us even had to ask where their food was. My daughter and her boyfriend had a similar incident just before Christmas when they were going to see the Nutcracker. We thought it might have been a one time fluke but as last night proved it was not. The manager did comp us a bit on our meals but it seemed like he didn't really care. I hope they resolve these issues as that used to be a great place to dine when we would go to the theater.",

The $20 sampler came with ribs that had literally zero sauce. The wings were about the size of a quarter. The spinach queso looked so different from the pic on the menu to the plate I didn't know what it was. They served about 3 tablespoons of white queso with three leaves of spinach and 10 chips and luke warm. The table next to us laughed when theirs came out and  sent it back. Weatched frustrated servers seat their  own tables because the oblivious hosts couldn't be bothered. Save your money and go literally any ANYWHERE ELSE. Should be zero stars.

Asked to see the manager again. He came to the table and appear nonchalant about our concerns. He did say he would take the drinks off. We requested separate bills, it came on one. We then asked for separate bills again and were given the wrong ones. We arrived 2 hours before the show started and barely got out of there in time! We do not plan to go back to that location. They might have been having a bad night but there are many other restaurants nearby we could have gone to prior to a show. It was a bad pick all the way around.",

The waiters and waitresses whoever is serving you they disappear for long period at a time even when the place is empty. This thing goes when it's time to pay long waiting for the payment to be processed. It is by far one of the worst places to go when you are hungry or in a group.",

She didn't know the menu, she did not check on us, she didn't even do the post check after she served to see if everything was satisfactory. She did NOT clear our plates, even when they were set aside, clearly marked as finished and she was at our table. Again, it was not busy. After all was said and done, she never offered desert and did not run the bill properly so points could be applied.
