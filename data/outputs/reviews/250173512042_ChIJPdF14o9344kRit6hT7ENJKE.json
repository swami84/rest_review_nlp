As a real chilanga, born and raised in Mexico City, one of the largest cities in the world with a rich culinary culture, I can tell you that this place made me feel like I was back in Coyoacan, one of the most hip places in Mexico City, with the best places to hang out and eat. @barra.unionsquare  you can find real tacos, salsas,  and some creative dishes like Tetela, that I tried for the first time, and a good selection of mezcal and non commercial tequila brands, tamales and tostadas that feel home made. In a cozy and secluded patio to chill and enjoy great food and great service. You can\u2019t go wrong. We will be back!",

I got the ceviche which was fresh and bright and I highly recommend the chips and salsa and grasshopper on the side. As an entre I got the Gringa which was phenomenal. The drinks here were also next level. We tried the Mezcal margarita, Sotol flight, Sotol cocktail and the Agualoca. The hosts here were so incredibly hospitable and even offered us a dessert drink at the end. I can't recommend this place enough.",
