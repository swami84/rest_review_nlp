First of all, we were the only guests dining from 3:00 till 4:00; however, they had been busy up until then. There was the bartender doing the bar, serving and placing orders so for us it worked very well. We shared an order for Fried Green Tomatoes which were excellent! Followed by a Summer Berry Salad and a KY Salad. Shrimp N' Grits for my friend and I had the Veggie Burger and House Made Chips. Everything was delicious. We had no idea what to expect and were very happy with our dining choices.",

The meals start with bread service, which are biscuits and cornbread with honey butter.  These are the perfect little biscuit if you\u2019re that biscuit lover like me.  The staff is super friendly!  Say hi to Kennedy, Kelly, and Katra for me!  Sway is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I\u2019m usually go for dinner.  They have a great outdoor patio when the weather is nice.

First of all, we were the only guests dining from 3:00 till 4:00; however, they had been busy up until then. There was the bartender doing the bar, serving and placing orders so for us it worked very well. We shared an order for Fried Green Tomatoes which were excellent! Followed by a Summer Berry Salad and a KY Salad. Shrimp N' Grits for my husband and I had the Veggie Burger and House Made Chips. Everything was delicious.

I ordered KY BURGOO which was a stew, but more like a soup that consists of shredded meats, beans, onions and okra. It was very good and reminded me of a Minestrone soup in taste with all of the individual ingredients cooked properly and flavorful in their own right. My entree was SPICY SHRIMP & GRITS which redeemed grits for me. The sausage was also a highlight and added quite a bit of heat to the dish. The sauce was a creamy barbecue that reminded me of the Barbecue  Shrimp sauce at Ruth Chris. Overall experience was excellent and I would go back again.",

The Mac and cheese had a nice flavor but I would have liked a higher ratio of noodles to meat. There was a lot of meat in it. I really liked the Black Forest cake. It was delicious.

My husband ordered the fried chicken and he loved it although I thought it was a bit on the salty side. His sides were cold and my soup was bland and taste like vegetable soup the alphabet soup u ate as a child. Me and my sisters ceasar salad was good although the croutons were stale! My chicken wings (rub) not good. Just wasn't a good dining experience at all. Nice place visually.",

The set up was really impressive. I felt like I was eating at a really up scale type of restaurant.The place does not have it's own parking so you will have to park at a meter, or a parking garage. And I will say that it's handicap accessible. The food was pretty good. I give it a 7 and a half out of 10. Although this might take away from the classiness of the restaurant, I kinda wish they had a few pictures on the menu so a individual can have a idea of what some of the item look like before you order them. Also I hate using cloth towels. I would have preferred paper napkins on the tables. Overall I would love to go back and try some of the other different things that they have. As far as the prices: I have no idea because I didn't pay for the food. Someone treated me out to eat. I definitely would recommend this place to others to go try out. It is a really nice restaurant, and I will be back.",

The food is well prepared, the drink offerings are good, and the service has always been friendly and superb. Important to me is the fact that within one single location, there are about five different areas with different moods (check my pictures): eating on the sidewalk among the bustle of the crowd walking to and fro but at a good distance away, open air looking out into the street but within the building, at a bar with a hotel lobby as a backdrop, a private and quiet dining area with minimal disruption, or a bungalow style exquisite dining table near to a community of happy guests with a massive indoor ceiling of the hotel to look up to for inspiration. Will definitely return to again.",

I'm  glad no one lost a filling in our party. $35 for a \"ribeye\" steak that was not grilled at all, just warmed up and gray on the outside. $30 for ribs that were probably cooked 4 days ago, just warmed up and dry. We should have left after we saw how unorganized they were, and when we saw the restaurant was mostly empty at 7pm on a Saturday night in the heart of Louisville. I'm willing to deal with poor, slow service, but with overpriced, poor quality food, I'm so disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Talked to the manager too, she had nothing to say or to help. It's pretty bad when the best part of your $180 meal was the mashed potatoes.",

It's NYE and we made reservations for 8:30, got there early, we live over an hour away from BIG city) and asked if it was ok to be seated. The restaurant was barely busy, had maybe 4 tables. As the hostess sat us, we asked to be switched to a \"dirty\" half booth, due to long drive. Plus, it gave us a little more privacy. The hostess response was, as long as it's ok with her and pointed in the direction of the bar. I looked at my husband and said I'm going to the bathroom, I want that table. I don't care what \"she\" says..... .we just drove more than an hour and I had to use the restroom, so I went ahead to the restroom. Actually we all went to the restrooms in the lobby since the restaurant did not have any. We got back, the half booth was cleaned and our menus were still on the other table.  We sat down and waited for our server after grabbing our menus ourselves.  Finally, almost fifteen minutes later, we get the server, I say THE because she was the only one serving and that is fine because there's only a few tables. Takes our drink order, does not write it down and then we wait. We watched as the waitress disappeared and the reappeared to server another tables food, go back and get them condiments and then go back and get a manager because they had a complaint about their food, get a different entree ordered from the other table and disappear again and then serve the other entree before we are served our drinks two at a time, because I guess they don't use serving trays for parties of 4? Drinks came and ordered food, it was 8:30 by now we realized 45 for drinks and to get food ordered.....but its NYE and we drove over an hour to get away!!! Patience Right??  Well another half hour goes by and our appetizers come out, two orders of dried green tomatoes and one beer cheese fries. Food was excellent!!!! Um, our first drinks were way gone by now and we need more!!! Half hour later entrees come out and by that time we are thirsty for another drink, full and tired of being here. All of us had not a drop to drink, but had to ask the server as she walked away for some water please and a couple of sodas. No one wants to eat, food is delicious but our appetites are ruined. My friend was served the wrong sandwich, he ordered shrimp, not chicken......we ask for boxes and had our coats on standing up by the time they returned, we couldn't sit any longer!  Food is great, if you have the patience, however management is NOT doing anything. There were two managers at the restaurant and neither of them addressed any of the problems in the restaurant other than they guy who didn't like the taste of his food and got a different entree. Any real restaurant manager would have seen how bad the service was and would have corrected it by now. The review I read before going were the same, good food bad service. Still true. Even on NYE and no one being there.",

Once we were seated they were very unorganized and got increasing upset when we asked to order drinks. After waiting for half our meal to arrive and asking 3 seperate times to order drinks we finally went the bar and got charge $20 for two vodka cranberries on draft. This was by far the most overpriced and over reacted restaurant I have ever dined in. The waitress mean mugged and griped at every request we made and made zero effort to accommodate our experience. When we asked for our checks they refused to seperate them even though we were guaranteed seperate checks, after arguing and causing a scene they finally followed through with their word.  WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!! If there was an option for zero stars I would have selected it.",

We had a reservation for 5pm on valentines day, which is early for us, but our show was at 7:30.  It was very quite at this time, since it was too early for most customers.  It was still quite when we left about 6:30pm, even though there were quite a few more patrons.  They have a nice wine selection, which is available in 5oz, 8oz and the bottle.  My wife had the Salmon with roasted vegetables & potatoes.  It was cook exactly how she likes it and it was very favorable. The roasted vegetables must have had 10 different vegetables in it and was very good.  I had their famous fried chicken with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  It was a 1/2 chicken (leg, thigh, wing & breast).  Enough for 2 people!  Everything was hot and fresh and tasted great!  It was a little pricy, but on par for a downtown hotel restaurant.  Wish they would have a 1/4 chicken instead @ maybe $17 instead of the 1/2 @ $24.  The salmon was $26.  We will definitely be back.",

Only con would be the $$4 they charged for soda.  This is the highest priced soda I have ever had outside of an arena.",

The second day I had the fried buttermilk chicken (which is a half of a chicken) and it was OUTSTANDING. The food is 5 stars, the service 4 ( it was a little slow but they looked understaffed). We had to wait too long for refills and one day 1 we never got the mango smoothie we ordered until we were leaving. Price is standard for a hotel restaurant but if you have a chance to eat here, I highly recommend it.",
