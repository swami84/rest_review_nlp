I recommend the tandoori chicken (I prefer tikka because it\u2019s boneless) and the naan, of course. If you can\u2019t get here, they do deliver and it\u2019s great then too \u2014 but if you can stop by it\u2019s a great small spot. The lunch special is very fairly priced and a good opportunity to get used to the offerings.  PREVIOUS 2017: Absolutely wonderful new Indian restaurant in Park Slope. It\u2019s in the space that housed a former good Indian spot, and it\u2019s awfully tiny, but it\u2019s really good. The chicken soup is lentil-based and excellent. The chicken tikka salad is very good. The naan is soft and crusty. I\u2019m looking forward to trying it again.",
