Soon after we got seated, our server came over, introduced herself and asked us if we wanted to order now or start with our drinks first. Right after she got us our drinks, somebody else came over and took our order. We had: chicken wrap, chicken shawarma, shakshuka, arabic flat bread and lamb burger.  Moments later all the order except mine which was the lam burger arrived. But my lamb burger also arrived few minutes later. With the exception of the shakshuka, the portions of the others are huge. As for my lamb burger, it was worth the wait. It is by far the best lamb burger I have had in my entire life and highly recommend it. It is very juicy and tasty and makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I can't wait till I go back and have it again. Anyone who likes lamb or wants to try lamb burger, then this is the place to go. Guaranteed you will be satisfied.",

The place is small but beautiful, really liked the decor and the second floor balcony area. The corner location gives a nice view of Michigan ave.  We ordered some drinks and appetizers. My first choice of drink, which had jalape\u00f1o in it they didn\u2019t have. Bad sign there, ordered an old fashion and a blood orange Manhattan. Both drinks were weak, the garnish on the old fashion was what looked like an eaten orange slice, my Manhattan used regular oranges. Both drinks didn\u2019t taste good, almost no liquor.  The appetizer was the Lebanese dish, the bacon wrapped dates were excellent, though they were quickly overshadowed by the dry hard falafel.  Our dishes came out, and although they tasted good the outer edges of the dish was cold. The center was hot and even steam was coming off it, but the food on the edge of the dish was starting to cool off.  I notified the manager, I asked if the food was pre-prepared and then microwaved, said no all is made from scratch. The only thing I could think was that our food was ready and sat on the counter until our waiter brought it out. I asked if they had warming lights to keep dishes warm, he said no.  Now the actual food had a good taste and seasoned well, it was just cold.  They did make it up to us, by giving us an extra side of saut\u00e9ed veggies and a baclava on the house, which again was delicious.  But I don\u2019t think we are going back, nor do I recommend the place.",

As a response to Kurah upon their comments: Thanks for your response. The way your restaurant served did not at all reflect Mediterranean hospitality. As you must well know, food is almost sacred in our cultures and how you serve people indicates respect or the opposite. I speak for my table and we all felt disrespected by the way your restaurant treated us. Just because we came as a big group doesn't give you the right to treat us differently (in the end you're not doing it as a favor). I hope you learn a lesson from this experience.  For your comments, 1) I didn't complain about the seating but specifically your serving everyone at different times (15 minutes is the minimum. Some students at the table next to us were served half an hour after we were served! This is unacceptable in any restaurant no matter how many people are served. 2) You didn't offer bread when we first asked (as I said the server said it wasn't included) but only after I brought the food back to the owner and complained. then (of course!) he said he'd bring it and offered another food: these two instances are not the same! 3) I'm not sure whom you mean by the host; as I said my students at my table were all dissatisfied and they said they had to eat because they were extremely hungry.",

It\u2019s rare to have so many choices when about half the menu or better is labeled GF or GF* with mild modifications.  Their kebab is fantastic but dishes like the biryani (butter and brown sugar fried rice) and crispy baked potatoes with Brie cheese are out of this world.

The atmosphere is nice, the host and waiters check up occasionally as well. The initial impression when walking in is that there is fantastic decor and it gives a unique feel because of the adjacent upper floor. At first I thought it might be cramped, but there is plenty of room around the area.  The Brunch menu was interesting, it wasn't too overwhelming either. Plenty of choices but not enough to leave you confused. My girlfriend and I chose the Egg Benedict with Smoked Salmon and Steak Omelet respectively. Both of our dishes came prepared with Rosemary Potatoes. Plenty of food for two people. What I liked about my Steak Omelet dish is that the steak had a rich Mediterranean flavor that I really wasn't expecting. The Smoked Salmon paired with the egg really melts in your mouth too. I would definitely recommend both dishes to first time brunch-goers.  It was overall an excellent experience and I give my compliments to the waiters, host, staff, and of course, the chefs.",

Everything we ordered were very good, especially the seafood cerviche, babaganosh, and biryani. They were very accommodating on taking certain ingredients out or serve on the side, and were able to turn vegetarian dish to vegan.  Really enjoyed the atmosphere, decor, and the music. It was a nice experience on top of the good food.  Since it was getting late, I didn't get to try their coffee or coffee cocktail. I would have to go back during that day for dessert and coffee only.  Update: went for brunch 2 weeks later. Kid got chocolate chip pancake. There's quite a few kids friendly items in the menu. The butter that came with the pancakes was so good! I was stealing pancakes just to eat the butter!! Smoked salmon Benedict was done perfectly, couldn't ask for anything better.  The skillet cookie wasn't so good though. I think you would like it if you like to eat warm cookie dough. I'm not sure was it supposed to be like that or was ours undercooked?! The cooked and crunchy edges of the cookie was really good though, just not a fan of cookie dough.  Cinnamon rolls were very good. I think rarely there are good vegan pastries out there. This is so good you won't even know the difference.  Oh yeah don't forget their outdoor seatings!!! It's on a side street with big side walk, so it's not even dusty or right next to the cars.",

Started with the triple z (zhatar spice, olive oil and olives), very yummy but apparently they think 6 or 7 olives is enough (hint it's definitely not). Also did the spread sampler (baba ganoush, hummus and garlic spread) and loved it! They certainly could have included more pita though. Their soups are TO DIE FOR!! Had both of their cream based soups (a potato and a leek one and a creamy veggie one) and I could have eaten a tub of each! Finally ordered a beef kabob lunch, tasty but lacked salt big time (which I had to request) and really needed extra sauce (a minuscule little cup will not suffice!). Overall great with potential to be outstanding with some tweaks!",
