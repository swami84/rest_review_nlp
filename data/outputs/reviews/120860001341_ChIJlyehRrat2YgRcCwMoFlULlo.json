This was around lunch time today my friend and I decided to get something to eat and noticed this little restaurant serving crepes and other things. My friend is Hispanic and I am African American  and the two ladies serving us were Hispanic, I presume ,since they were speaking Spanish to one another. I placed my order first and paid 14$ for a bubble waffle with fruits and ice cream with a side of Scrambled egg.I waited awhile for them to tell me that they don\u2019t have ice cream \ud83d\ude11. If I would\u2019ve known that prior too, I probably would not have gotten it.I checked out and it was a quick checkout. When my friend checked out, they asked her would you like anything else? Would you want something to drink? I was like, they did not ask me. That was strike one. Strike two was when we got our purchases. She had one box and I had two. They asked her if she wants a bag . I waited a while to see if they would off me a bag since I had two plates and they did not say one word ,so I had to request my own bag and place it inside. To me , this bothers me because it should be equal treatment all around. They will not be getting my services again.",

        "caption": "First let me say the food is spot on amazing. I took a friend of mine here while we were shopping in the Aventura mall and decided to try it. We were blown away by the taste. Top notch. Unfortunately, the service not so much. First time I went , I waited at least 15 minutes before I got my food but to be fair, it was a little busy.  The second time I went ,which was a few weeks later was a nightmare. Some of the staff seemed visibly annoyed and not interested in attending to the customers. One guy had his EarPods in while making the food and blatantly ignored patrons while they were trying to talk to him about their order. The  cashier was nice but she was overwhelmed as people started getting visibly annoyed it was taking a while to get their food and when it came it wasn\u2019t what they ordered. I myself waited more than 10 minutes and was getting annoyed that they made part of my order which was getting cold because they started making someone else\u2019s order before completing mine. The lack of professionalism by their front line staff needs to be addressed . You shouldn\u2019t have EarPods playing while you are dealing with customers. It\u2019s rude ,and when you mess up, try to act like you care since you are charging people for the food! You fix that and you will be 5 star.",

They were, however, very understaffed and had only one person working as both the cashier and the chief which meant a much longer wait for the food. Even when more staff came, it still wasn't any faster. Regardless, it was still very good and I would recommend.",
