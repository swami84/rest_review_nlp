Stick with the spicy!  We got the spicy wontons, water spinach, Dongpo pork belly, and Dongpo fish. The wontons was the most well-made. The fish tasted fresh but the pork was a bit greasy and lacking flavor imo. Veggies were great. The portions were quite large and we ended up taking a lot of food home, however, the bill came out to be a lot pricier than expected.  Service was quite slow since there were a couple of other customers, and only one server (the lady was suuuper nice). We had to wait for quite some time for our food to come and to get the check. I also felt awkward speaking during the meal because it was so quiet in the restaurant. Not anyone's fault--the other customers just happened to not talk.  I think the food here is okay, and the menu items are hit or miss. The restaurant is a tiny bit out of the way of most Chinatown restaurants.",

Unfortunately, the food did not live up to my expectations of a restaurant specializing in Sichuan cuisine.  I had the boiled fish, twice cooked pork, and Dan Dan Noodle. The quality was average and the taste being merely authentic. I felt each dish was very underwhelming for a Sichuan dish, as it lacked spiciness, but mostly the complexity of spices that remains to be a signature of Sichuan cuisine.  The Dan Dan Noodle was the most underwhelming because it reminded me more of beef lo mein than Dan Dan Noodle. It was served with one tbsp of beef and some sauce at the bottom, nothing else. Other than that, the food is average and moderately priced for a quick bite with larger parties.",

However, they offer 2 free little appetizers (peanuts and bamboo salad, I think?) while you look at the menu, plus a free pot of tea. The Kung Pao Chicken was nice, no Panda Express-style dish. It had plenty of celery, chicken, peanuts and hot red peppers nicely prepared and cooked. You could taste the garlic and the ginger in the sauce. I also ordered a cucumber salad, which was delicious and prepared with an entire cucumber. Portions are not skimpy, which is greatly appreciated. The decor and ambiance of the place are a little outdated, definitely not as hip as the rest of the restaurants around in Chinatown, but I believe this place is worth a try.",
