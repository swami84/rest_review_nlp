My mom claimed several times it was the best saltimbocca she's ever had and it's one of my favorite meals. We shared a pitcher of their red sangria which was good, but I wish it had some rosemary in there to bring a little more life to it. We were very satisfied with the meal and had a wonderful time.

The service is delightful, with a special regard to House Manager Regina, who greeted our table with sincerity and even made my mother, who frequented Mario's often in the past, with familiarity. Excellent touch to service. Here is the thing, the courses we ordered were very miss. Let's start with the Escargot which was soaked in butter and olive oil. If you are a connoisseur of snails, you'd prolly be better off eating warm bread and margarine. The Branzino which though was pretty delightful in taste, was alil sparse on size and be careful to find the occasional bone in the bite. It was accompanied as requested with spinach that laid on a small plate drenched in liquid that did nothing to present delectable. And the taste, well, heavenly consumed with garlic. The lasagna which I presumed to be a staple especially on Arthur, I found to be lacking in substance, namely, ground beef. Each bite was more noodles with an air of ricotta than anything else and lastly the Creme Brulee cheesecake, is just cheesecake. If you are hoping for a creamy caramelized fusion, you may be disappointed as we were. The only dish that I could truly recommend from our order is the calamari though that's not saying much to diversity. These days good pizza spots can knock that one out the park. I think perhaps, a spruce of the menu is in order.",

We shared some appetizers which were decent, no complaints, but they weren't extraordinary, especially given the reputation for this place. I ordered the chicken cacciatore and it was absolutely the worst I've ever had. They used old, poor quality prosciutto which ruined the whole dish. If anyone has ever had the unfortunate experience of tasting stale prosciutto, you'll know it's very unpleasant and overpowering. The entire dish was overwhelmed with that horrid flavor. I didn't send it back, even though I most definitely should have, because that's not something I could do without my mind being stuck on the thought of my food possibly being tampered with for the rest of the meal. Either way, my dinner was ruined and I won't be coming back here. They should be ensuring their ingredients are fresh before serving a meal",

The calamari was good, very crispy, and not oily or soggy. The anchovy sauce that came with the spiedini is what made the dish great. The baked clams were delicious, not chewy with a delicious  filling. For my main course, I ordered the salmon Regina. The topping on the salmon was delicious, and the fish was fresh. For our table, we ordered rigatoni, which had a delicious vodka sauce with peas, shallots, and prosciutto. This was outstanding, and quite possible the best pasta I have ever eaten. However, the best part of the meal was how all the deserts were nut free. My sister and I both have but allergies, and it was great that we could eat dessert, which is not something we usually can do. For dessert, I ordered a cannoli, which was delicious. The shell was light and crispy, and the filling was smooth and creamy. Hope I can come back soon.",

In the 1980's and 90's, the security around the city became poor and Italian immigrants formed a Self-Defense Force to protect the Italian town. Since it has been operating almost after isolation, even the Italians retain their nostalgic taste. There are also many famous Italian mafia, so if you talk to an old clerk, you will find amazing mafia stories. It seems that Benjamin Siegel, a buggy, was at this restaurant when he was at the bottom.

It has been around for 100+ years and I hope it stays around for 100 more and that my kids get to share the gnocchi and other deliciousness with their kids and their kids kids.",

I had never eaten at Mario's, but apparently every doctor had, and when I read their choices included Mario's Salmon Regina, every single doctor ordered the Salmon Regina, they didn't even want to hear the other choices so I ordered the Salmon Regina too! Mario serves the salmon Regina with the most delicious Dijon cream sauce I've ever tasted! Not only is it delicious, but it pairs beautifully with salmon! Mario's has hit their sweet spot with their Salmon Regina! Considering that was 20 years ago and I am STILL raving about it, you can be confident in dining at Mario's! So take it from me and 20+ doctors, order the Salmon Regina!",

This treasure opened in 1919 and has been serving large portioned meals with warm traditional hospitable service on the block for what feels like forever. A reservation is recommended to get a table in the classically decorated old school dining room . With cozy tables nestled next to each other you'll feel taken back as to what family style dining was, is, and should be. They have great staff that will make recommendations and tell you what they truely think. For our appetizers I ordered a burrata plate which was soft moist and simply over flowing with taste. To go with that we also had a shrimp cocktail and a salad for 2. The fresh super light bread which was amazing was used to sop up anything left on the plate. Then we ordered for the 2 of us a A plate of Noki Sorrentina. Soften potato noodles with red sauce, ricotta, and mozzarella. Bursting with flavor. My wife ordered the chicken scarpiello which was tasty, well rounded and beautifully done. Chicken was soft tender, and not drowing in sauce. The peppers were so tasty. I had the real sorrentina which was wonderful. Fresh eggplant , and prosciutto and. a light crispy breading that flakes when I ate it. Wow. For desert we had traditional coffee paired with a strawberry covered cheese cake tart, also added a rainbow cake which was epic as well as a chocolate whipped cream cake. My meal was amazing naturally with left overs. All the foods we tasted were freshly made and had material from the neighborhood.  Great staff and a chef that walks around and greets people so he show his passion for cooking. Bring your appetite ,and doggie bag for left overs. A great place where food is made with  love and has been for 100 years strong. MARIOS GOTTA GO..",

The food was excellent, with generous portions (enough to take home!) and perfect pastas from homemade manicotti, to delectable seafood dishes,  pasta in vodka sauce with prosciutto, and a very fine wine selection. Everyone loved the tiramisu and other desserts -- it was the  perfect place to celebrate our successful Concert, and we could not have asked for better service!",

The northern Italians may dominate the contemporary restaurant scene, but for fresh, rich, abundant food, you can't beat Naples. Marios's puts the *red\" in red sauce. There are great antipasti, pasta, and main courses, rounded off with delicious desserts. And their portions are enough for two Manhattanites. Spuzzulare!  Friends from the Fordham neighborhood brought me here, to the Belmont section, on Easter. Maybe people were wearing their Easter Sunday best, but it was great to see a restaurant full of people of all ages in dresses and suits. Every table was multi-generational. And down to the smallest customer, everyone was eating happily, talking, gesturing dramatically, all at the same time.  Get to the Bronx! Mario's is worth the trip.",

I recommend going around 6:30ish before the dinner crowd really gets settled in. For appetizers we had the fresh mozzarella and tomato plate. They also automatically bring freshly baked bread with olive oil and sliced peppers. For my entree, I got the cacciatore. Some of my chicken pieces were slightly rubbery, but those were only a few small pieces. Otherwise, the flavor of the sauce was delicious. While the entree and appetizers were great, the dessert was the most delicious of all. Highly recommend the tiramisu and also get the espresso with a dash of anisette. Perfect ending to a delicious dinner. We will definitely be back.",

I recommend going around 6:30ish before the dinner crowd really gets settled in. For appetizers we had the fresh mozzarella and tomato plate. They also automatically bring freshly baked bread with olive oil and sliced peppers. For my entree, I got the cacciatore. Some of my chicken pieces were slightly rubbery, but those were only a few small pieces. Otherwise, the flavor of the sauce was delicious. While the entree and appetizers were great, the dessert was the most delicious of all. Highly recommend the tiramisu and also get the espresso with a dash of anisette. Perfect ending to a delicious dinner. We will definitely be back.",

The escarole I ordered was under cooked, the Lasagna I had was not heated up enough -  a small portion was reasonably hot, but the rest was luke warm.  I wanted it heated up.   Twice I had to get up from my table to get the attention of and speak to a waiter with my request.  It seemed instead of having my original plate of Lasagna heated up, it was replaced by another order of Lasagna which did not taste nearly as good as the first!!!!  (miscommunication and possibly a cook who resented criticism). I was told a sous chef was in charge of the kitchen that day.  I do not want to see this restaurant with a wonderful Italian-American history and great food go down the tubes because of the carefree staff  and an untalented cook  I experienced that day..",
