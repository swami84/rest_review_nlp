        "caption": "This particular location of 7-Eleven has gone downhill since it was purchased by a franchise owner a few months ago.  All of the friendly staff at night are gone and they are replaced by guys that sigh loudly when you ask for absolutely *anything.* The tall blond guy still has yet to figure out the 7-Eleven Rewards scanner and questions everything the customer says when it comes to sale prices that didn't ring up because he was unable to use the scanner gun correctly to get the rewards number in the register and automatically take off the amounts for the sales prices. My god - the store is the size of a shoebox and he has been there longer than 2 months! How difficult is it to remember a few sale prices?  The microwave was out for over a month, which negates the sales tax, because by NY state law, the food is exempt if it isn't hot (and without the microwave in house, the packaged burritos, sandwiches, etc qualify as exempt.) The customers were told the microwave was broken, but it was still on the counter and one of the customers plugged it in and used it - the cashier got mad about the customer using the \"broken\" microwave successfully.  I asked tonight about when they stopped serving hot food (pizza, roller foods, etc) because it was 12:30am, and the grills were *clean.* They used to have hot food until about 4am, and then would clean up and change the grills over for breakfast for 6am. The cashier (the blond guy again) said they didn't serve hot food after 11:30pm. I just got pizza there Wednesday night last week around 1am, so I am assuming this is part of the \"sigh at everything\" mentality when someone asks for something (anything) he doesn't want to deal with. People in the neighborhood all know the blond guy and are pretty vocal about this is why they don't go in 7-Eleven at night - no one wants to deal with him.  EBT payments have been stopped at this location, and the small sign on the door is see-through, so you can't read it. The change was abrupt, and it was embarrassing for the 3 people in front of me who were going to use their EBT to pay for food. The guy behind the counter pointed to the sign in the door that no one could read and said \"We do not take EBT. Don't you have some other way to pay?\" Poor-shaming at a convenience store that overcharges for everything was a low I never thought I would see from someone in the service industry in NYC in 2019.  The new owner is obviously unconcerned about people frequenting his store, or about giving the customers a good experience and/or quality products anymore. There are two 24 hour grocery stores (Westside Market at Broadway between W.97th and W.98th and Key Foods at W.97th and Amsterdam) plus countless 24 hour delis (like the one almost at the corner of W.96th and Broadway - it is on the south side of W.96th.) The prices are comparable to 7-Eleven, the food is freshly made, when not packaged, and the people working in the deli are professional. Why is this 7-Eleven still in business? Visual connection because it is on Broadway will only get you so far. Skip this store and go to the 24 hour McDonalds between W.96th and W.95th if you want quick, cheap, marginally hot food.",
