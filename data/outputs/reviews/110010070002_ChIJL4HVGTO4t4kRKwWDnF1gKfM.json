We received one appetizer soon after ordering but did not receive anything else for over an hour. Someone finally explained that our ticket was lost and we understand that these things happen but when our meal arrived one was the wrong dish and the other was missing a side. Throughout our entire visit there was a lack of attentiveness even after the screw up was brought to their attention. We asked for the check and we were offered a dessert on the house but didn't get the check for awhile,  until we asked a second time. Overall the food was very good but the service was lacking which made our experience not worth the time OR money. (and a key lime pie was not sufficient)",

While my cocktail did take a moment because the bartender forgot that I had ordered it service was ok. A manager sat at the end of the bar doing business.  Initially the atmosphere looked promising from the outside but unfortunately once I was inside and seated I noticed the seats are made out of cloth I noticed many stains and felt it was very unsanitary.  The roasted calamari was flavorful but the roll it was served with was lacking depth and salt. The herb marinated fish skewers also lacked flavor. I was hoping they would be more herbaceous. I could tell the fish on the skewers were not fresh due to the dry texture and fishy flavor. That\u2019s usually a sign that the fish was frozen. And. While yes the happy hour is only $6 for dishes on another note perhaps that\u2019s just what you get when you pay such low prices.  The cocktail was balanced and perfect.  Scores with 1 being the least and 10 being the greatest:  Service Score: 6 Hospitality Score: 4 Food Score: 6 Management Score: 3 Atmosphere Score: 6  Overall I would not come back to this place at the end of the day.",

Main reason for 3 stars is that the place smelled very badly of fish- which, if you did not know- is not a good sign in a seafood restaurant. A fish smell that strong means their refrigeration system is not cold enough, they've left seafood out, or it did not come in/stayed fresh....will not return",

I am sorry to say that I can\u2019t tell you what the food was like because when we got there we waited over20 minutes to even be greeted.  After that 20 minutes we decided to leave and go to another restaurant down the street. There are a lot of restaurants on that street. We ended up going to Matchbox and it wasn\u2019t the best food I had ever had but at least we were greeted when we came in. Choose another restaurant in DC because there are hundreds that would be happy to have customers to give good customer service to.",

They offer happy hour everyday from 4-7pm with $5 small plates and specials on beer/wine/cocktails.  So we liked this since it was a Saturday!  Brunch is served on Sat/Sun from 10a-3p.  STARTER: We started out with the HH roasted calamari which had a nice Mediterranean twist with capers, sun dried tomatoes, shallots served in a broth with crusty bread.  Highly recommend as a starter and the calamari was cooked perfectly, not chewy at all.  ENTREES: Crab Cake Sandwich ($18) with jumbo lump crab, lettuce tomato, old bay aioli and fries. *Really delicious blue crab meat, very little filler, only complaint was that the crab cake itself wasn't a bit larger.  The fries were surprisingly soggy!  Not sure if they were having an off day, but maybe go with a different side.  Haddock Picatta ($21) served with brown rice and sauteed spinach. *I opted no Picatta sauce and honestly the fish was so delicious by itself, I didn't need the sauce.  The haddock was a fresh and healthy 8 oz-ish portion served over a bed of tasty brown rice with scallions and a huge portion of sauteed spinach.  I found the spinach to be a little too salty and wilted for me but it went well with the rice.  SERVICE: Our server was attentive and came by as needed, no complaints there.  I would definitely be interested in coming back for brunch on the weekend and checking out their desserts.",

The food itself was dope--my date had the seafood pasta (shrimp, scallops, etc) and I had the roasted sea bass. It was delicious. My only 2 notes--the rustic parmesan potatoes is just a baked potato with parmesan on the outside of it. Didn't have much flavor until I added salt, pepper and extra parmesan to the inside of the potato. Probably should be advertised a little differently. Also, the booths were kinda old-looking and not aesthetically pleasing. Other than that, great happy hour, good service, good eats!",

I enjoyed two appetizers from the Happy Hour menu: herb-marinated skewers and mussels ( requested white sauce ) and a main entree: seafood pasta. The skewers were my favorite, although it was only two mini skewers, the taste was burst of flavor...it featured a mix skewer od salmon and swordfish. The mussels melt in your mouth. The seafood pasta was a mouth full, def dancing in my seat too ( as another reviewer described it ). I will be returning to this restaurant with friends and I'm asking for Mark's sections.",

The deserts all had raspberry sauce drizzled on them, though it was not mentioned by the waiter nor requested by us. Otherwise, the coconut cake and salted caramel cheesecake were very good.

No, I didn't complain, I was just grateful any food came at all. Just to be clear,  we arrived at 1:30-1:40pm on a Sunday afternoon, the place was quite and had a nice patio. Our server took 15 minutes to get 4 waters, 2 juices and 2 beers (which she spilled 1 and 2 waters and had to return for more) the beers weren't even brought in the bottles, just poured into a glass, so who knows what we actually got. The food, was hot when it arrived, except for the bacon that I ordered with the pancakes (that was a soggy cold addition). The crab cake, was at best a 2 oz. patty on a massive sized bun (in comparison). Look, I get that crab is expensive, but to serve that, that was just cheap! It all smacked of the attitude that \"we can do whatever we want bc it's DC\". I didn't not tip the server, but I definitely didn't tip what a decent service - meal would have required. I can honestly say that I will never go back, too many other places to go try.",

It is also overly salty and the veg is a bit mushy, making me believe it may be canned. I would have expected chunks of fish, at least a mussel or clam or both, and at least 1 shrimp. Nada.  3 stars for the nice atmosphere, proximity to metro, and pleasant staff.",

Both times we absolutely loved our dinners.  We've ordered the grilled salmon and the Chesapeake stuffed flounder. Both dishes were excellent, cooked perfectly. The presentation and the sides complimented the fish extremely well.  Before Ophelia's we would  go to Matchbox for the salmon and halibut and the dishes we had from Ophelia's were definitely much better. I would say the style is simple, very flavorful, and very well designed dishes from people who know what they are doing.  It doesn't seem as much thought is out into the matchbox dishes. By far our new favorite restaurant in Capitol Hill.",
