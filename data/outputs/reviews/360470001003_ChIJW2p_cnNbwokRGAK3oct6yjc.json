        "caption": "Amazing food, beautiful decor, nicest owners/staff - Brooklyn Heights has needed a spot like Cardinal Mkt, and it's finally here! We are regulars for morning coffee and pastry, breakfast sandwiches (one of the best I've had in my life, truly), happy hour for oysters and drinks, and dinner (the steak is delicious). Everything I've eaten here has been really high quality and great flavors. The outdoor area is great for sitting and grab & go or take out is available too. I'm SO glad Cardinal Mkt has joined the neighborhood, must go!",
