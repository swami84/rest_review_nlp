        "caption": "Very expensive and it was just too plain for the price. The worst was seeing one of the Sushi makers pick out some coins from his personal bag and car keys and then returned the bag to a cabinet behind him and did not wash his hands after. He then proceeded to making an order for a customer. Since we were seated at the bar my wife and I saw the whole thing and were totally shocked. At least we were done eating but it was a total turn off. I'd recommend Sansei on the 3rd floor of the Marriot Hotel just a few blocks down. Its better then Furusato. I wouldn't recommend this place.",
