For god\u2019s sake I make better ramen at home! For starters the chicken had no type of flavor, only flavor it had was the taste of the grill. The broth which they said in the description was supposed to be a spicy curry, turned out to be watery curry with no spice and no FLAVOR. The pork I will say this, was very flavorful and delicious you guys get a thumbs up for that. The disrespect of this entire meal had to be the noodles and the price tag. The noodles were mediocre at best and the price at 23$ I could\u2019ve gotten two bowls of better curry ramen at Naruto ramen! Only reason I gave this place a shot was because my coworker was buying lunch. Needless to say we ended up throwing out our food, it was just that bad.",

I\u2019ve tried four different ramens here, and each one has had completely different flavor profiles and characteristics, delivering a truly diverse variety of (wonderfully delicious) ramen options unlike any of the many, many others ramen places I\u2019ve tried in the city.  Location is pretty small, but they do a good job of serving/seating people pretty quickly, and the atmosphere is enjoyably cozy. Pro tip: join the Yelp waitlist ahead of going.  Love their custom Nakamura ramen bowls featuring drawings of famous NYC sites. The ramen spoons are also more ergonomic than some other ramen places, making for easy portioning & sipping.",

We got shiso fries as a starter (nice!) and the tontoro pork ramen.The ajitsuke tamago doesn't come with the ramen if you don't order it extra. We did and it was perfectly cooked and marinated. Broth was velvety, rich and super delicious, noodles were nice! The best ramen I have tried so far (however I haven't been to Japan!). I will definitely return!",

This place is famous for the tsukemen (limited availability) by chef Nakamura. We ordered pulled pork tsukemen and torigara ramen and fried shishito.  Shishito is perfect, lightly fried, not too oily and the salt is just enough for the flavor. Fresh, and it doesnt overly hit the spicy unbearable level. Tsukemen noodle is a tad too soft to my liking, its not al dente, and cold (winter i guess?). The pulled pork broth is overly salty if consumed by its own, but when mixed, it paired up nicely. Torigara ramen is a clear soup base, with I'd say has more of a chinese flavor to it rather than japanese (perhaps of the spices and ingredients). Noodle is also a tad on the softer side.  First time trying tsukemen, i still prefer the classic style ramen where my noodle is firm and soaked in the goodness of broth. Attentive and friendly service, cozy and relaxing place. Though they messed up my order, ordered the lunch size, and when the bill came it shows up the normal price.",

There is French music playing from a small bose speaker in the corner which is amazing. The avocado uni app is much more flavorful than expected - highly recommended. Same with the wings.

Our waiter came to take our order within a minute but my parents were still looking at the menu. Whoa..slow your roll boy!  We ordered after a few minutes and while we were waiting for our ramen, the waiter was on his phone the entire time. Not very professional.  Our food came and in all honesty it was nothing to write home about.  Jidori chicken ramen Chicken was dry and overcooked. Too much bean sprouts in the noodle and not much else. Flavor was average at best. Noodle was not al dente bordering on the mushy side. I paid an extra $2 for the egg which was not that tasty.  Tontoro ramen My parents had that. Mom said it was too salty. I tried it and indeed it was. They weren't didn't particularly enjoy the paper thin slice of pork either.  For what they charge, I would expect something better. Disappointing..but not as appalling as what I saw next...  While we were still waiting for our food, the couple next to us asked for the check. The waiter gave it to them and they charged it with their credit card. They must have been japanese customers from out of town because the entire time they were speaking japanese. When they got up to leave, the waiter rudely said YOU DIDN'T TIP ME in front of all the patrons.!!! Not acceptable on any level! If you didn't get tipped, you should speak with them in private perhaps outside NOT IN FRONT OF ALL THE CUSTOMERS. My folks and I clearly heard him say it. The Japanese customers were clearly taken aback and didn't really understand what he was saying so he said it again and then they finally realized that he wanted a tip. Ok I get it..maybe the out of towners forgot but the waiter totally EMBARRASSED them and made them look a fool in front of everyone in the restaurant. Not cool at all. And then the customer tipped him and hurriedly left. The waiter looks at me in disbelief and I say well they don't tip in Asia..and he said well this is AMERICA. I get it. But there's really no need to be so rude about it. Maybe they didn't like your service or lack of service. And then he proceeds to tell me that the Asians and Europeans tend to do this. HELLO! I'm Asian and frankly speaking I'm thinking about whether or not I should tip you now that you're so outright rude!!  **a quick scan of the space and there was not one japanese staff there whether it was front of house or in the kitchen. Hmmm maybe that's why!  One done. None shoulda gone.",

Very below average and definitely not worth the $20 I spent. Water tasted like tap water and wasn\u2019t even cold.  Service was kinda bad. Super small place with limited seating on a Saturday evening ~7:30 pm. I waited almost 30 minutes for a seat for 1.  Overall, I should\u2019ve listened to the other reviews and gotten the Torigara ramen. Or even the Tontoro Pork would\u2019ve been better. Ruined my dinner with the Shaki Shaki.",

For an appetizer, I ordered the calamari which was a special that day. $8.95 for 6-8 pieces of tentacles was not worth it. Shaki shaki spicy ramen (\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc broth tasted like bamboo shoots) and the tontoro pork ramen (\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc). My friend ordered the miso ramen (\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc she didn\u2019t enjoy it).  Love the owner of this place but I wouldn\u2019t return to give it another try.",

I had the Jidori Mazemen and while the broth cut through the chill in my bones like a hot knife, the soup was a bit too salty for my taste. I picked at it for a bit and couldn't finish it. When asked if I wanted it to go, I declined. The waiter proceeded to let me know that they were always happy to reserve the dish to my liking. I thanked him and asked for the check. He was nice enough not to charge me for the ramen. Totally unexpected and awesome of him to do that. Dude was super attentive, knowledgeable, and kind.

The Torigara soup was perfect to me with light soy sauce. I was happy to have the chashu pork that was fixed and warmed when it was served. The extra order of marinated egg $2 tasted perfect \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb and not too salty. $10 Yuzu Wings \u67da\u5b50\u306e\u624b\u7fbd\u5148 \u96de\u7ffc/\u96de\u7fc5 This dish looks like coming with 10 wings. Actually each wing was cut in half so that total were 5 wings. The wings were deep fried and then topped with housemade Yuzu sauce. Mmm.... As an appetizer, this dish was okay to me but I was not that excited when I was having them. The sauce was like American yuzu sauce and it was a bit salty and too sweet to me. I will go back there for trying another kind of Ramen menu next time instead of wings. Service: My orders were down in 10 minuets that was great. Two guys at the kitchen and the only waitress were not Japanese. Service was okay \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb as American style. Don\u2019t expect to hear \u201cthank you\u201d when you step out this ramen shop. Remember that here is America. I like that they use an electronic pad for letting me pay tips and sign. I got my receipt by email electronically. Size of the ramen shop: only 20 seats with 8 small tables (one table for 2 people) and 4 counter seats. Restroom: very clean ! I didn\u2019t expect too much but I was surprised to see that clean restroom when I opened the door.",

I\u2019m still a rookie when it comes to trying ramen and exploring the many different offerings in the city, but compared to the places that I have been, this place was the best. The service was good. The ramen was great. The broth? Fantastic. It really made the meal. For reference, I had the \u201cTontoro Pork\u201d which consisted of rich and creamy pork broth, chashu pork, spinach, nori, chewy noodles.  I highly recommend this place for anyone who never had ramen before or people who are looking to try a new place. The smaller places always seem to have the best food.",

We both ordered the smaller bowl, and felt satisfied leaving.  Now, the plan for the day was to enjoy a lot of food in a lot of places, so if you\u2019re hungry and want to be full to the brim, order the larger size.  I did think it was strange that there was an extra cost to add boiled egg to the ramen, as I have typically had that included in the base. There is also an option for extra noodles, which we saw come in handy for a fellow patron who ordered the larger bowl, and wanted to finish the remaining broth with more noodles.  The restaurant is small, so capacity is quite low, which might explain the wait some reviewers mentioned.  The staff is friendly, and the service is really nice without being overbearing. Overall, good place.",

The chashu was very good. Just enough chew in the meat and fatty enough to fill you up. There was only one piece of chashu in the bowl but it was very large, taking up three quarters of the bowl.  The service was exceptional, the server was polite and friendly and the food came quickly.  The environment is understated yet classy.  I recommend this restaurant if you don't have a large group of people and looking for good food and great service.",

The flavor is wonderful, the decor is inviting, the kitchen is busy and hot and ramen here is made with a strong passion and it shows not only in the kitchen but the waitstaff as well.  Highly recommended, pictured is the XO Miso (vegan on the menu, vegetarian because of the added ajitama egg). Not pictured but also highly recommended is the Cauliflower / Crimini Sautee appetizer. If you like your noodles extra thick and chewy, get some extra (i needed them, and don't regret getting them).",
