My friend was impressed with the portion size of the quiche and I felt the same way about my burger - Which has two patties AND a fried egg in it, and comes with fries!! It was delicious. Fries could\u2019ve been better but I\u2019m not complaining. Probably had to wait to get a table outside for 15 minutes after coming around 12:30 but not bad at all. Would definitely recommend this place. And their bellini was great too.",

I've called 5 mins prior to arrival to make sure they have avocado toast. They (super politely) come back with a \"I'm sorry, we are out of avocados\" (no biggie, although upsetting that my earlier call was a waste). Ordered egg Benedict - it looked nice but tasted super blunt and lacked salt (had to ask for salt). That said, my friend got a burrito, it took good 20 minutes AFTER my egg Benedict was served (and yup, they actually suggested a free drink just for the long wait, we've politely said \"we appreciate the gesture but no free drink is necessary\") and *wait for the punchline* fried potato was salty beyond belief. I personally like salty (hence asking for salt for my egg Benedict) and yet when I tried my friend's fried potatoes it was like weirdly salty. I've politely notified them that the potatoes are super salty and they asked if we'd like a new one that has no salt or has less salt. We've agreed. New batch was as salty as first one (SUPER SALTY). My friend (being super hungry) basically ate the burritos and left potatoes after being \"poisoned by the amount of salt in them\". Personnel asked if the new batch is good and I asked if they want an honest answer or a kind one - they got my point. Once again - super nice personnel. Kitchen seems to be a disorganized \"mess\".  P.S. That same kind personnel said they'll give us a break on the bill for all the troubles. Ready? Their applied discount was $1 (ONE DOLLAR). 3-star just went down to 1-star. Are they testing our kindness?  **update:** After I asked \"was $1 the discount you've mentioned earlier\" she realized how comical that $1 discount was and came back with \"I've removed the latte from the bill\" line. Going up to 2-star. Not coming back again.  **RESPONSE TO OWNER RESPONSE** We\u2019ve politely rejected the idea of getting a free croissant or a beer now what\u2019s insulting is that the price of the beer is way more than a buck and upon realizing our kindness of not taking free drinks we\u2019ve been given a $1 break on our bill as 10% off one dish. Seriously? After the whole trifecta of failures the least your polite team could do is either wipe up the bill or cut it to 50% but giving literally a buck break is beyond my understanding of well run hospitality business. Thanks for the invite, but thanks no. Well deserved 1-star after such a weak response.",
