Got an order confirmation by email, but no followup ETA on when to pick it up.  Guessed 30 min and stopped by on a Saturday evening and it was hot and ready. Friendly staff, good packaging (paper bag, no styrofoam, all recyclable plastics and foil containers).  Papadums were little rounds and were excellent. Veggie samosas good, a little salty for my taste. tiffin box with chicken curry and sag paneer was ok, but the mild was spicier than expected. Rice was normal with several cloves and a big leaf. Medium Paneer curry was expected level of heat. Generous paneer portion. Kheer was added to our order on the house, and was good. Garlic naan was decent. I haven't had a lot of Chapati Roti before, so I'm not sure what to compare this to - but this version seemed either dry or undercooked and really wasn't to my taste.  Vegetable momo dumpling looked promising, and 8 dumplings were included - but the filling was crazy dominated by onions, and wasn't to my taste.  This part of Highland really can use good Indian food - and this review is for their second weekend being open - so i'm assuming they're working the kinks out.  I hope to give them another shot because I want to see local businesspeople succeed - but i'll wait til I see some more positive reviews.",

The only weak point was the plain naan bread. Not terrible. Just nothing special. Still, more than good enough for the purpose of cleaning the delicious sauce from your entree off of your plate.
