He did this after I placed my order and was looking for the restroom, the place has an entry around the kitchen that looks as if it might be the bathroom.  He knew exactly what I was looking for and pick the WRONG GUY TO TRY and DISRESPECT.  I asked who he was talking to me on such a rude and barking tone.  He puffs his chest out and and barks \"I'm the owner, what do you want.\"  His feelings were hurt after I responded in the equal manner and walked out leaving the food I had paid for and all.  I'm assuming he spoke down to me because I was somewhat dirty from the construction work that I do. He needs to learn how to approach human beings.  I left the restaurant and went to my work truck as he sat there quietly sobbing and focusing in on me.  After setting him in his place, his little WEASEL feelings were hurt so bad that he acted like a hurt little girl and called building management and  everyone he could since the company I work for was working at his location/building and lied about the whole 30 second issue.  Mind you this CLOWN wasn't man enough to return my 7 bucks as I wouldn't eat anything from man-less trash like him.   I'm happy though my 7 bucks will feed his wife and kids since the business has poor ratings.  Little did he know that I had read him like a book and immediately called my job and told the a LITTLE WEASEL would be calling to complain and BAM, what did he do?  He Called everyone under the sun in Typical butt-hurt WEASEL fashion to lie and complain.  His feelings were truly hurt, I saw his eyes tearing as he couldn't stop looking at me even after I left the establishment and went to my work truck.  HAHAHAHA  This CLOWN needs to Learn how to approach people and not to discriminate or whatever hair was up his butt. This is exactly why he has POOR RATINGS all over the internet and the employees don't stick around.",

The coffee is good, though nothing spectacular. They do have a really nice patio area to soak up some sun while eating your breakfast. On that note, I've found the breakfast sandwiches to be delicious. Try eggs and whatever on a croissant. The servers are reliably fantastic.",
