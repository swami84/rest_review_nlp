To celebrate the Lunar New Year with my husband and 2 kids, I decided to place an order on their website directly instead of seamless so they didn\u2019t have to pay third party fees. HUGE MISTAKE. Placed the order online at 7:33pm, was given an estimated time of 50 mins for delivery, which I thought was reasonable because of the holiday. However, after still waiting for our order at 8:45pm, I emailed AND started calling the restaurant to see where my order was. The line was busy but I finally got through at 9pm. The lady who picked up asked, \u201cAre you calling to see where your order is?\u201d When I answered yes, she then proceeded to say, \u201cAll the seamless orders have been sent out, but the other orders were cancelled.\u201d WHAT?! I understand if they got overwhelmed with holiday orders, but it was an intentional decision on their end to prioritize only the seamless orders and then to essentially ignore/disregard the others. NO PHONE CALL, NO EMAIL, NOTHING to communicate that they couldn\u2019t handle the order 1.5 HOURS AFTER I placed my order. Needless to say, they totally ruined our evening. NEVER EVER ordering from them again and telling everyone we know to STAY AWAY. I don\u2019t care how good their food is, this is totally unprofessional, irresponsible and not the way to run a business.",

Since moving to Brooklyn last year, I could not find a good Wonton Soup, until now.  I also ordered the Vegetable Dumplings/Wontons in Hot Sesame Sauce, and it was delicious. This was recommended by a previous reviewer, and for that, I am very thankful.  Lastly, I ordered their Steamed Shrimp Shumai. This caught me by surprise as I love the small, bite size ones you find in Japanese places. They are bigger here and seasoned differently. They were good, but I do not expect to get them again. Perhaps the chicken version will meet my preferences.  The service was good and the staff was very friendly with everyone that walked in. The bathroom was also clean and well stocked with soap and paper towels.  I will gladly come back and sample more dishes.",

He gets there and they tell him \"nine fifty where?! Go somewhere else!\" He calls me and tells me this.  I asked him \"what? Let me speak to them\" my friend goes \"no, I'm not letting her touch my phone after being nasty with me. We going to order somewhere else.\" I call a few mins after and I ask \"why did you tell me it was $9.50 for the shrimp mixed vegetables and fried rice and tell my friend that it's not and to go somewhere else?\" She argues with me. She talks over me without letting me speak and I say \"okay, I'll write a review for you. Bye\"  I'm clueless on why she was being a disgusting human being? But the other guy was nice over the phone. Whatever, everything happens for my own benefit. I probably would've ate something awful and wasted my money. So thank you, beautiful universe! :)",
