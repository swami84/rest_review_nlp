There are so many great memories made there and mostly because of great THAI foods and friendly staffs, making our experiences exceptional.  Great Pad Thai ever.. and not to mentioned the best Soup Dumplings and affordable. Special thank you to the owner. I like to come here when Toon is working- She goes out of her way to make other guests and I feel welcome and entertained with her friendly hospitality. Despite the frequent turn over in restaurant business happening in Dekalb Market Hall, it has long been established in Downtown Brooklyn. So Salud, cheers .. to many more Pad Thai Shrimp PLS!!!!!",
