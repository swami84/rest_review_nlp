It felt something they had prepared 1 week in advance and only reheated in microwave. My wife ordered Salmon which was rubbery in texture and was tough to cut even with a knife. I ordered vegetarian food. Flafel's, the heart of any mediterranean food and theirs was yucky, it came with some foul smelly gravy on top. we had to ask for some without gravy. We ordered the whole food off of resturant week menu so that they can pace accordingly but sadly all the food arrived in one shot. Their wasn't even place to keep the whole food on table so we had to sent some back. Our server also didn't try to make any effort to serve us adequetly. My friend took Bottomless Drinks and had to repetedly ask for second drink. Eventually he walked up to the bar to order his drink. Usually after a bad expereince I would be willing to give any restaurant another shot but it doesn't feel like that Ankara would be able to make any difference to it.  The only good thing they had was their cocktails. We tried 4-5 different ones and they were all good.",

It was so dry ( hard to cut with fork) and lacked seasoning, and our server told us that \"this is how it is suppose to be.\"  I don't think that is true especially for a tender fish like Salmon.

My fianc\u00e9e and I had recently dined here for dinner and had one of the best experiences the year. Our great server helped guide us through the menu and made some personal recommendations from the cocktails to the dessert... and everything was fantastic.  For drinks, we started off with \"The Spice Trade\" (a Mediterranean twist on the Old Fashioned) and the \"Mediterranean Mule\" (pretty self-explanatory), both of which were perfect. It was then that we knew that we were in for a treat. We went on to some cold and hot mezze - a trio of Hummus Sumac, Muhammara (Roasted red pepper dip), and Mutabbal (Smoked eggplant) along with Halloumi skewers - everything perfectly sized for sharing between 2-4 of your closest friends. We then tried the Sucuklu Pide, which is a boat-shaped flat bread made with Spiced Turkish sausage and mozzarella, as well as Truffled Scallops and Roasted Short Ribs. The short ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and packed with flavor, definitely one of my favorite dishes on the night. We finished with traditional Turkish desserts - Baklava and Kunefe (Shredded wheat pastry, unsalted cheese, pistachio, kaymak). Both desserts were beautifully prepared, well-balanced, and had just enough sweetness.  Overall, a stellar experience with top-notch service and next-level food. With the ambiance, hospitality, and extensive menu, Ankara is a great choice for any occasion from a casual night with friends or date night with that special someone. Pro tip: Leave room for dessert. As someone who's not big on desserts in general, just trust me.",

As I already wrote below, Ankara used to be one of my favorite restaurants in DC & hope they can keep its quality as it used to be.  Ankara resturant used to be one of my favorite restaurants in DC, but I believe today will be the last time to eat in. I don\u2019t know if the management changed or what! They used to be very friendly & used to have a very delicious Turkish food menu. Last year I noticed that they canceled 1of the famous Turkish dishes (Iskander) & today brunch menu was kind of appetizers & light plates!  The most thing made me disappointed today was how staff were un responsible. I booked a table outdoor for 3 ppl @1pm, as I have an important guest visiting from overseas. For very special reasons we arrived early around 12 pm, staff didn\u2019t cooperate to give us a table outdoor & offered us high uncomfortably seats \u201cindoor \u201c however I really care for Covid-19 ! Until 1pm then will move to our table outdoor. At 1:25 I asked them if they still remember us while we have half an hour to leave for our work. It seems that they forgot us then they offered us a small table in a smelly corner (where it used to be smoking area).  I am shocked! I never expected this from such a good restaurant. There are many other Turkish restaurants we can replace it easily.",

The ambience is perfect, they have a beautiful outdoor deck with tables comfortably spaced at a safe distance. We started outdoors then moved inside which is beautifully decorated with a choice of traditional tables and semi circular booths, great for intimate dinners or larger groups. The service was impeccable...I'm scared to mention the servers name in case I get it wrong but Leslie comes to mind and i think she said she's Columbian (we all thought she was Turkish at first!) She was amazing, beyond knowledgeable about both food and drinks, super professional at first but when we made it clear we were chill and enjoyed chatting, she took the time to stay and have a conversation with us which made our experience even better...it's the experience that makes people go back to a restaurant...not to be confused with service...a robot could give you great service but only a truly talented server can give you an experience that you'll remember and write about! The food was outstanding and the chef was kind enough to introduce herself to our table, I think her name is Serap (sorry if I'm wrong). Everything was delicious, I love Mediterranean food, it's so fresh and there are a huge variety of flavors. We tried so many dishes. It was a Thursday and we saw they had a bottomless brunch. That was surprising for a weekday but what was more surprising was that the food was bottomless as well as the booze!! I think we tried everything on the menu, it was so good we kept ordering more, in fact the only bad thing about the restaurant is that you might gain 5lbs from one sitting! The drinks were also great, as well as the usual mimosas etc you also had a choice of unlimited draft beer (including craft selections), wine and mixed drinks. The bottomless lasted I think 2 hours with dessert and coffee as part of the package and was only $39! Unbelievable deal...you could barely get beer and pizza for that price never mind exquisite food, drinks and service in an upscale establishment. If you're in the DuPont circle area of DC you HAVE to try this place, I might actually make the 4hr drive from NYC again just to have another Ankara brunch...Thanks guys - it was the perfect ending to our trip",

The best Turkish food I had in town! Healthy, fresh, delicious, affordable. We ordered ribs, cold Meze platter, Musakka (eggplant with minced meat), Lahmacun (thin, Turkish pizza). They were all amazing. It was the best food I ordered in the last 2 months during the COVID crisis. Will absolutely order again very soon!  Second time: we dined in this time and loved it! Tasty food, very friendly staff, inside is very clean, cute patio, reasonable prices. Try Tandir, ribs, hot and cold mezes, Efes (Turkish Pilsener beer). Will definitely return for more!",

More importantly, they made us feel at home, and we appreciate the cultural pride and sincerity that exude in the dishes. The musakka greeted us well with rich creaminess and zesty seasoning. The eggplant and ground beef were tactile. The chicken kabobs tasted juicy and were expertly charred, while the muhammara stroke us as bright and fresh. The meat pide, perfectly fired, delighted the palate with thin crisp texture that blends well with the lamb and cheese. The fresh ingredients advanced to the very edge of the pide. Last but not least, the manager brought us a plate of carefully crafted baklava, where its gentle sweetness dances with a nutty creamy explosion. Highly recommended! You will first be greeted by the ingredients, surprised by the art behind each bite, and finally confiscated by the wonderful service.",

The manager Asly and the waiter are extremely knowledgeable of the detailed preparations of the dishes. More importantly, they made us feel at home, and we appreciate the cultural pride and sincerity that exude in the dishes. The musakka greeted us well with rich creaminess and zesty seasoning. The eggplant and ground beef were tactile. The chicken kabobs tasted juicy and were expertly charred, while the muhammara stroke us as bright and fresh. The meat pide, perfectly fired, delighted the palate with thin crisp texture that blends well with the lamb and cheese. The fresh ingredients advanced to the very edge of the pide. Last but not least, the manager brought us a plate of carefully crafted baklava, where its gentle sweetness dances with a nutty creamy explosion. Highly recommended! You will first be greeted by the ingredients, surprised by the art behind each bite, and finally confiscated by the wonderful service.",

The spreads are a great way to start, I suggest the babaganush and shakshuka. The pita bread is dense and while it\u2019s amazing, try and eat the spreads with just a spoon so you save room for everything else!  The Brussel sprouts are amazing a good mix of sweet and savory. The stuffed zucchini are also a must order, a good mix of veggie and meat.  The pides are just wonderful. So carby and you can have them vegetarian or with meat!  Although not part of the deal, I\u2019d highly recommend ordering a dessert. The kunefe is truly amazing.  Ankara is a nice open space and can accommodate all age groups, family and friends and especially diets!  I\u2019ll be back soon!!  Best bottomless brunch deal in dc. $34.99 for bottomless Turkish / Mediterranean tapas and brunch drinks!! Menu is extensive and there is something for everyone (all different diets) to enjoy. The overall atmosphere of Ankara is elegant. The staff are very attentive, professional, kind and knowledgeable about each menu item.  Service is prompt and each dish is beautifully plates. I truly felt that each dish was crafted for the customer, it's definitely not a \"mass production\" line in the kitchen. The food came out at the perfect temperature.  From the meze, to the pide. To the meats, cheese platters and desserts, it was a wonderful experience. Mimosas were strong too :)  Can't wait to return!!",

I am huge fans of both! Some of my favorite dishes: the Phillo rolls, the spreads (hummus, etc.) The bread to accompany the spreads is super fresh. \ud83d\ude0b I\u2019m also a huge fan of the flatbreads - I literally dream about the Eggplant Flatbread. The smoked salmon is so fresh, and makes me drool just thinking about it! The food is also very authentic! For both the bottomless brunch and dinner, drinks are included! Nothing compares. You can get wine, cocktails, rail drinks... and it is super affordable! Let\u2019s talk about service. The food is spectacular, and the service is second to none!!! The team at ANKARA gives you all the feels, and it feels like a family!!! The staff are all lovely, and very knowledgeable about the food! They remember you, and you feel like you are truly an important part of their day. The patio dining at Ankara is a dream! It is great for people watching, but you are far enough removed from the sidewalk that you can have a conversation with the person you are with. It is also super convenient for location - in the heart of DuPont, steps from the metro! Great for dining alone or with friends \ud83e\udd17 I love Ankara. I cannot wait to return.",

About 10 minutes later the waitress came to check on us and out of nowhere casually said \u201cDon\u2019t eat too much of the spread next to the chicken kebab, because it contains nuts\u201d. I momentarily freaked out internally but calmly asked what kind of nuts, at which point she said it was walnuts. Crisis was averted thankfully but it may be worth providing some more education on the seriousness of allergies to the waitstaff to avoid potential issues. Otherwise, had a lovely experience here!",

However, I dont know what happened and how it happened but the food was horrible. The dolma (stuffed grape leaves) we ordered were store bought. I thought  that was the worst of it but I was wrong. The meat they served us was frozen, it was fake, processed trash. I couldn't believe my eyes. I was with my wife and a friend and we all got sick from it. On top of the disgusting food they served us, the prices were so jacked up it was just unbelievable. The food is not Turkish, it would be a disgrace to say that its Turkish food. Its not from any country, its unique to them. Do not go there, maybe for drinks but absouletly not for food. You will get sick and be ripped off for sure. There are other decent Turkish restaurants in the city that are 100 times better than Ankara. Worst Turkish food by far. Disgusting and a shame to call it Turkish food.",

Our entres were definitely too small with an average taste ( tiger shrimp, kufte, the taste was average). Our cold appetizer ( seafood risotto) was a decent size but tasted like dill and whole peppercorn,I don'trecommend it. The dessert on the other hand was extremely delicious ( Baklava) highly recommend it... in comparison with other Turkish restaurants the food was average, but the service and ambience were definitely outstanding, hence 4 stars rating",

But my experience with Ankara was very disappointing. Very small portions but still overpriced. Lack of taste. Chewy chicken and lamb. Appetizers were missing the flavor and tasted not fresh. We kept asking for more water and house bread . The entrees  came out cold . Really disappointed for the money we paid . Think twice before choosing this place and (as I did) my mistake do not believe in the reviews. I should have listened my colleagues and gone to our fav Turkish restaurant in McLean.KAZAN. if you want real Turkish and professional service just drive there and there are plenty of parking . We had to park our cars in garages and paid there too just to eat something not tasty,but pricey at Ankara..",

The hostess to the wait staff are very friendly and kind. The food is fantastic. The last time that my girlfriend and I were there was for Valentine's day. The special they had that evening was fantastic and we both enjoyed the meal. I will say the culture of the restaurant is that they definitely want you to enjoy the meal and take it slow. So given that information you may want to allow a little extra time for your meal especially if you're going to order dessert. Overall I highly recommend this spot... It's really great.",

We met at one of those  builders meetings in Baltimore, there she was introducing their BEST doors in universe (as she says) and she also mentioned about her previous restaurant experience and recommended  Ankara to me .  She explained almost all the items in the menu . And some great info about Turkish wines.  I was so impressed that I even imagined myself as if I am sitting somewhere facing the Bosphorus  and she was so good at marketing Ankara ,I even thought should I invest my money to buy this restaurant :-) J/k :-))) Anyway I tried Adana kebab and couple of cold mezes. All tasted very delicious . I have been to Istanbul couple of times. So I love Turkish taste. But still Baklava and Spanakopita belong to us . Don't fight me over those .. Since I am radically from GREECE :))",

We all love Turkish food but never had the chance to try this place. The food was flavorful and yummy!! We ordered bunch of small plates to share so we could taste different things. Sigara borek, dolmasi, zucchini patties were incredible! We also loved their spinach flatbread, it was like a fluffy pizza. My friend who has been to Turkey couple of times suggested to order Adana kabob since it was his favorite Turkish dish and we all loved it! The apricot dessert was one of the best part of entire evening, along with the baklava of course. Our server brought Turkish tea in tiny cups as a compliment with dessert which was really sweet of him. Ankara has become one of our favorite spots with the quality of food and service!",

Very expensive for what they served .  As I looked at some tables they got more attention probably they were friends of the owners or the management.

I went there with my fiancee last week for dinner. We paid everything what we ordered . everythin was so bad. not tasty not fresh . the kebabs were really bad/ lack of flavour and dresiing/ the service was awful maybe because we were not americans so we may not tip them .but we did %18 tip in the end no matter what .  we tried to ask the server some details  about the dishes but he was also so mean to explain. this is really a shame . and we did not like this restaurant and they are misleading people who really want to come here . do not believe those 5 star reviews .we went there and tried .it is not a cheap restaurant so dont spend money here. my fiancee told me not to write this but I could not help it. because this is the real review. sorry guys .",

I was with a very large party and we shared everything we ordered, so I don't remember the names of all the items from the menu, but everything was extremely good.  Our waiters were kind and extremely personable. Additionally, all of our orders were correct and brought out to us quickly. The restaurant itself is very well maintained and clean.

I especially liked their bread & apricot jam, hummus, carrot hummus, m\u00fccver, chocolate cake, baklava, and tea.  The bad: while their menu offers a good variety of items, please beware that they may not have every item on the menu, especially toward the end of the brunch period. This is normally not an issue I care too much about because I understand that food supplies are finite, but I was very put off when servers did not bother to ask if we wanted substitute items when notifying us that they were out of the items we had chosen. On two separate occasions severs told us they were out of a menu item and then they quickly walked away to service others. The most off-putting experience occurred after we ordered Turkish coffee and dessert. You normally want to have coffee and dessert together, ya? I would argue that's a perfectly normal expectation. Well, they brought out the dessert but no Turkish coffee and supplied no information about when it would come. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes, we asked a server if the Turkish coffee was on the way and he said the machine was malfunctioning and that he would try to get it to work. After a couple of minutes, the Turkish coffee came out but another perfectly normal expectation was not met - it was (nearly) ice cold! I've been to Istanbul thrice and have never heard of such a thing! If their quality control falls short when it comes to Turkish coffee preparation, something that a Turkish restaurant should do perfectly, I have to question their entire food production process. Sadly, while I'm a fan of Turkish cuisine, I cannot recommend this eatery. Go somewhere else for Turkish fare!",

We opted to have them select some dishes since we weren't familiar with many of them and they brought out the most delicious assortment of hummus, meats, and other small plates.  Our server was incredibly nice, attentive, and humorous, and made the brunch a delightful experience. The selection of drinks in the bottomless menu was nothing short of expansive and made ordering each new flavor of mimosa a treat (can't go wrong with the pineapple.)

        "caption": "I'm so happy that I finally visited this spot. I've always been a fan of Mediterranean food, Turkish food, Middle Eastern food... Using those terms doesn't really do the wide range justice there are so many cuisines packed into each. Turkish food is technically counted as Mediterranean but there are various differences. For example, who's right by the sea and who isn't matters.  The space at Ankara is good for groups but they also have tables for loan diners or pairs, in addition to the bar. There's a decent selection of cocktails, I tried the Ankara Martini I highly recommend, especially if you like pineapple, rum - you know that combination kind of pina colada but without the coconut. I'm yet to go for their bottomless brunch that's something that they have available.  They recently revamped their menu so it's leaning more towards general Mediterranean and less Turkish, but Turkish elements remain on the menu. An appetizer that I would suggest is the baked hummus. I don't know about you but I've never had that until this visit. It's almost like mac and cheese but then it still tastes like good old hummus which is nice. I would also recommend one of the flatbreads that are quinessentially Turkish. Also known as Pide - basically a baked bread with meat cheese or vegetables such as eggplant. I'll also recommend that dessert aside from Turkish coffee. I myself selected the pistachio cake which again I'd never had before it was almost like a cheesecake. Highly recommend this place, it's right outside the Dupont metro station, get in where you fit in.",

The baba ganoush, ezme, and dolma were incredible. I highly recommend the baba ganoush - it has a nice smokey flavor. The bread was a highlight of the meal. The salmon was simple and delicious, and it came with a side of spinach and pine nuts, with some seasoned raw onions and peppers. My partner is vegan - he had the turlu and was disappointed with the turnout (he said it came out lukewarm). Likewise, I ordered baklava for dessert and it was rock hard. The staff was friendly, but seemed forgetful even though there was a good number of servers. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, and it has a large interior. On a nice day, you can take advantage of the plentiful outdoor seating.",
