They do not clarify the different prices on their menu regarding a splash, a glass, etc. We thought we were paying $8 per glass, but it is $8 per splash and $17 per glass.  Last year, we went for a late night Happy Hour. Our bartender sold us a more expensive wine with the idea we would be getting a \u201cdeal\u201d because it was Happy Hour. We assumed that Happy Hour meant we would be paying less than $10 a glass, and we should have clarified. Happy Hour is only $2 off the original price of $17. For 4 glasses of wine we paid over $60+tax and saved $8. Ridiculous. We might as well buy an incredible bottle of wine and drink at home one block down.  I brought a group of over 20 people here one time with idea of it possibly being a monthly meet-up. The feedback I got was that it was too expensive. The second month 6 people came. We moved the get-together. Not that this really matters, but they didn\u2019t comp me even a \u201csplash\u201d for bringing the group in the first place.  After our $42 bill for two mediocre glasses of wine on Tuesday night (which we stupidly thought were $8 each), we are crossing Tannat off our list.",

I am not a wine connoisseur but I can tell good wine and it was good. The food was an issue for me. I ordered the bread and cheese platter  The cheese was delicious, the bread would have been better if it wasn't so hard. I get that the bread is made of organic ingredients, and I like organic bread, but it shouldn't be so hard to chew. Heating it up would have made it a little softer.  The there were some little drips on the plate that I think were for dipping, but there wasn't enough of the drippings to actually get a decent taste, I think I tasted sort of apple butter, but I'm not sure.  I know these establishments pay a fortune in rent. And I thought the menu was reasonable for the area and reasonable that they are serving homemade farm fresh ingredients  I would rather pay a couple of dollars more and have a decent size portion of the dipping sauces. Maybe it's me, I don't spend a lot of time in wine bars, so perhaps I am ignorant of what a bread and cheese platter should look like. Regardless, I wasn't happy.  I can't really say how I feel about the green soup. I love vegetables, but it didn't have much taste. I think I was expecting something that tasted more savory. It needs something that it's missing.  I want to love this place because it reminds me of the cool, funky places I hung out in in college. The atmosphere is cozy with a decent wine selection. I appreciate what they're trying to offer, butI think the food could be better.",

She made clear that she wanted the $7 glass, and we both assumed it must have been, because it was quite small when it came out. Great. As the drinks were so tiny and it was \"happy-hour,\" my date ordered 3. When the bill came, we were shocked to see that it was $60. I informed our server that we thought we were getting the smaller of the two glasses (the $7), but she said that the 5.5 oz. glass was the large one. I told her that I felt she had misled us, especially by telling us that it was happy hour numerous times. The atmosphere was nice, but the service was deceitful and done with a smile. Furthermore, there was no attempt to remedy the situation by the manager and we were forced to pay $60. You've lost two customers.",

They offer natural wine and genuinely seasonal dining, hence, their menu for both wine and food changes throughout the year, on monthly or even daily bases sometimes. I love that you can get something new every time you visit!  The inside is small, covered with wood from the floor, walls, and furniture, creating cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It has a nice big open door/window at the entrance, looking out to the beautiful greenery. They are across from Fort Tryon Park, and only a short walk from the MET Cloisters museum.  Most of the wines are available by the splash (half the glass), glass, or bottle. They have sparkling, White, Ros\u00e9, Red, and Orange. I love the idea of splash, this way, we get to try more wines without too much commitment. Since there were three of us, we each got to try two different kinds of wine, total of 6 splash of different wines. They were all very good, and the staff was very knowledgeable of the wines, so he gave really good recommendations as well.  When you are having good wines, you have to pair it with a good food companions. They offer farm-to-table, working with small Hudson Valley farms. We got Basil Duck Rillettes, Jacuterie Black Truffle Salami, Persian Cucumber, Smoked Trout Toast, and Wild Mushroom Pate. They were all good high quality, tasty and went great with the wines.  The atmosphere was very comfortable, relaxing, cozy and welcoming. They have great wine (and beer) selections from all over the world. It is a great place to try out new wines that you never had opportunity or even heard of. The staff have great knowledge of the wines, we learned a lot from him. He was nice and attentive, he took a good care of us. It was a very nice first visit, I am sure we will return for more in a near future!",
