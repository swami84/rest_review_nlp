Highlights: - a creamy and flavorful ricotta starter with fresh, crisp bread - my girlfriend's generously-portioned and fall-off-the-bone tender lamb shank - hot and tasty mulled cider  Lowlights: - the restaurant has two outdoor patios, one directly outside the restaurant equipped with large heat lamps, and one under a tent that left much to be desired with small, ineffective heaters (most of which were lacking propane fuel). we were seated at the latter setup, and unfortunately it was no better than if we were eating in the open air in 30 degree weather. - a tasty mushroom soup that unfortunately came plated in a large, shallow dish which meant that it went from piping hot to lukewarm in just a couple of minutes in the cold of patio dining - a duck entree brimming with sauerkraut and mostarda but light on the actual duck and accompanying fingerling potatoes  Hats off to Mintwood for a Restaurant Week menu brimming with choice (n.b. short rib unfortunately was sold out during our dinner), a feat during the current business environment. To offer some constructive feedback, if the outdoor patio seating won't be heated as advertised, please communicate with customers beforehand so they can arrive armed with more blankets and/or gloves.",

The only downside to the burger was that it was dry perhaps from the bun.  I do not like an over saucy burger, but this one just was not so juicy.

Our party ended up being larger than expected. And I will admit this can be frustrating for the restaurant, the way my friend was treated by (who I am going to assume is) the manager, Gene, was very unappealing by a restaurant manager. Gene rudely leaned over our table and all but lectured a group of women trying to get brunch. He didn't check on us at all after the seating fiasco, and refused to budge on giving us another table. As a former server, I watched the tables around us and there was an empty table near us for over an hour after we had ordered. It was obvious he was just unwilling to accommodate the change.  Although the experience with Gene will keep any of us from returning to the restaurant, our server was very lovely and attentive. She was fun, interacted with and checked on us, made sure everyone had drinks, split our bill the way we asked, etc. Jheneal made the experience for us.  If the manager had been more friendly, even without being able to accommodate the change I would give Mintwood Place 5 stars and return. Unfortunately there are too many amazing places to eat in DC that also have great management.",

His recommendations are very honest and trust worthy. So If  he says this is good, please believe it! He let me know this is basically French comfort food. There was nothing I disliked, from the drinks, to the appetizer, my meal, and even dessert. I tried medium well for the first time, and I have now been converted! This is the first time I can say me going to a restaurant was an experience. If u want happy hour, it's strictly at the bar. You have to get there when doors open. We got there at 6/6:30 Fri night, and it was full. The ambiance is nice and cozy, matching the theme of what's served. What I really appreciate is, the service isn't rushed after your meal. Most restaurants will rush you to leave when you finish eating, but not these folks.  They deserve every great review they received in the newspaper. I will definitely go again.",

The stand out was the Charcuterie Board: Selection of Cured Meats & Chicken Liver Mousse also amazing was the White Peach & Balsamic Soup, Goat Cheese, Crouton.  The food was simply fresh and clean, which took American fare to another level.  We pretty much tried the whole menu but the real stand outs of the evening were the Branzino, Pearl Couscous, Tomato and the Tagliatelle Bolognese, Pecorino with an honorable mention to the Wood-Grilled, Dry-Aged Bacon Cheeseburger, Fries.  But for me the Branzino was the superstar of the show.  Light, buttery, and so much flavor, would definitely order that dish again.  Overall the staff was friendly, the atmosphere was lively yet quiet enough to hold a conversation; ideal for a small dinner party or a date night.  This restaurant will definitely be added to our GO TO list whenever we are in the city!  Can't wait to try Brunch ....",

Not filling in the slightest and for the extremely overpriced rate of $19.  2) No bread served with pate. Who wants just spoonfuls of meat?  3) We had to ask for a soup spoon despite numerous employees seeing us futiley try to eat with the spoon provided for coffee.  4) Tea kettles were served about 10 minutes prior to actually getting tea cups.  5) Someone stole my girlfriend's umbrella.  6) A mimosa was missing from the table until just before the meal was finished.  7) One of the loudest restaurants I've ever been. Yelling is necessary for conversations at the same table.  We've been for dinner and we've been for brunch. Will never return for either.",

Some of our party had food allergies and the waitress was very knowledgeable about the food, and asked the kitchen when she wasn't sure about something. All of the food was amazing (try the Mac and Cheese!). Even though it was incredibly busy (we did come on a Saturday night though) the atmosphere was great and we were all taken care of (our waters never went empty).

Ridiculously over-priced eggs dressed up as gourmet experiences (and an $18 hamburger?!?), check. Inattentive and mediocre service (had to ask multiple times for things like cream for coffee, water, and utensils). Super-slow kitchen--we must have spent at least 45 min waiting for food.  Again, I get that brunch is popular, and the place was packed on a cold Sunday.

While it's sometimes hard to find a reservation, I've had surprising luck walking in to a table.  The appetizers are a clear gem on the menu; vegetarians should try the kale and burrata, while carnivores might like the steak tartare.  The entrees change seasonally and with availability, but it's consistently excellent.  There is the rare item that is oversalted, but after years of coming here, it's pretty rare.  One of my favorite restaurants in DC (and was an Obama dinner date once, too). :)",

If you like sweeter drinks, order the Clover Club. My wife ordered the Foggy London Town and loved it as well. As you sip your drinks, they bring out a warm basket of bread with salt butter. AMAZING!  For an appetizer, we ordered the the burrata, kales, hazelnut, apple & tamarind. It was one of the best appetizers I've had in DC and they even equally split it on two dishes for us.  For our main course, we both ordered the cheeseburger and it was one of the best burgers I've had in DC with crisp bacon and a perfectly toasted bun. Two things to note: 1) It's very easy to eat. Some burgers are so messy to eat, but this one perfectly fit together making it easy to eat, and 2) It tasted like a gourmet Big Mac. I don't say that to scare people away, but if McDonald's turned their classic Big Mac into a gourmet burger for the President, this would be it.  Definitely go here next time you want to celebrate an occasion!",

I had made advanced reservations for a special occasion (birthday) at Mintwood Place. Midway through our appetizers an alarm sounded. This alarm was very loud and made conversation near impossible. It sounded another three times before our waiter informed us that they were forced to close for the evening due to kitchen issues. This is understandable and I am not unsympathetic to the issue, but we were handed our bill and treated with very little compassion, having had our plans ruined. Not a single item was comped and the apology seemed much less than genuine. I chalked this up to the panic of the moment and made a mental note to contact a manager later to reconcile the issue. I did so, but the reception I received was more apathetic than the initial experience. The response (from the manager) was that it was \"beyond their control\", and that it is the \"price of doing business\". I'm sorry, but I have now paid full price for items at a restaurant, for a meal I could not converse during large portions of due to your alarm system, was rushed out the door without finishing, given apathetic treatment, then told that this is the \"price of doing business\" with you? Well if that is the case I will certainly not be returning. As an establishment that considers itself to be high-end and aims to deliver a fulfilling experience I did not expect this. You delivered an experience, but it is one I do not care to ever repeat. If you value a business that treats clients with respect then this is not the one for you.",

Apps are well portioned, tasty, and beautifully presented.  Entrees appear hit-or-miss.  Salmon was simple, elegant, masterfully prepared; chicken, while well-prepared, was drab and monotonous.  To much of one thing.  Wine list is extensive, but offers little under $60.  Recommended.  Reservation necessary on weekend.",
