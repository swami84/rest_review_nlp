The downstairs is a bar, and it's always hopping. Go up the stairs, and find the restaurant space which is cozy, nice, and wonderfully quiet! The staff and owner take a personal interest in the guests, and you'll see quite a lot of people at your table. I appreciate this. It never feels intrusive. The food is good. Last time I was there, I didn't think it was as good as previous times, but it's still solid food. The menu changes, and the one online is never the one you get in the restaurant, but that doesn't bother me. They have a huge wine and cocktail list. Anything with gin is good. But, tell them what you're used to when it comes to drinks. They do experimental stuff, but they'll find something that fits your tastes.",

Downstairs bar, had horrible rap music and a bartender that was  a cool, non-welcoming, non-verbal, un-wine educated guy who eventually warmed up to us- we did all the work.  C- Asking him to change his music was laborious. We were one of two couples, almost same age -60\u2019s in the bar.   Hey!!! Look around, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t appreciate the music de jour, it\u2019s just appalling when you\u2019re being bombarded with pounding, awlful lyrics at 4:30 - 5 happy hour!  I asked him to change the pounding rap, but was told it was a play list.   Hmmm... so we spent $50+ 20% tip ( We owned a restaurant).  Upstairs was a joyful, absolutely delightful experience!  Food was exceptional, as was service and the GM in charge. A remarkably engaging man whom we recalled from our earlier visits.  We live close by on Kalorama Rd. Suggestion:  Have upstairs Re-train your bartender to be more welcoming and wine knowledgeable. He is attractive and knows his gin, but takes waaay toooo long to be pleasant and welcoming!  And check out his play list!!! How about Begin with Tony Bennet and Amy or geez just about anyone other than bam, bam, bam loud music  it\u2019s about looking around and seeing who your customers are.   Not that hard!! I won\u2019t come back or recommend until you stand out! Way too much competition!!!",

I complained to the manager, who defended them and stated they were just being \"festive.\"  I responded that their loud screaming was inhibiting our ability to converse.  I asked the manager to speak to them; he refused and proceeded to provide all sorts of excuses for their uncivil behavior (\"once their food comes, they'll quiet down\").  Finally, I had had it and went to the table and asked the women to stop screaming.  One gave me a snarky remark.  They continued screaming throughout their stay.  The management didn't even offer to move my party, despite the fact that there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant.  This is an expensive restaurant for food that is just OK.  This situation speaks volumes about where America is today.  People are becoming more and more uncivil and disrespectful of people around them.  Extreme individualism and political correctness (everyone is right, and no one should be confronted when he/she engages in behavior which disrespects the people in the vicinity).

I get it: this place doesn't look like much from the outside, the decor a little boring, the neighborhood isn't known for having high quality restaurants, and I'm not sure the owners are as attuned to cultivating their reputation as they should be; I don't think anyone walks into N.H. and feels like they're entering a top DC restaurant, there is no detectable \"buzz.\" But I've got to say, for a neighborhood place, it hits way above its weight -- some of the better meals I've had anywhere in town (and the service is good too).",

Waiter took our order, forgot our bread (we had to ask for it too) and when it came, it wasn't even warm. Received my cocktail after ten minutes, the waiter handed us a random \"from the chef\" veggie and creme fraiche thing on spoons that we hated when we looked distraught. The people who refilled water and bused tables were the most responsive people. If only we could have tipped their attentiveness instead...  Food did come. I had the lamb, mother had chicken, father steak. Food cooked to perfection, which is a saving grace, but the annoyance was the wait staff, not the actual food. Fingerling potatoes were great.  Perhaps this is just one problem with one waiter, but it's enough to stop you from wanting to go back for a $200+ meal for three, right? I'd rather go to Palena.",
