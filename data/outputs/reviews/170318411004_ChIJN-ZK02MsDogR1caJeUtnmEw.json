They pretty much just dropped everything onto our table as if they were bothered by us. It also seemed dirty. Although the door was closed and they didn't have windows opened, there was A LOT of flies.   I've been to other places in Chinatown that are way better and cheaper.

The only mark against them is the service, which was slow and error prone. I would have liked to give 5 stars but unfortunately service is part of the experience.  I got the bun bo hue, a spicy seafood noodle soup and this place does not dissapoint! A shrimpy broth with lots of noodles and extra. They also add more stuff than other places like fish cakes and blood cakes. A tasty, filling meal for $10 can be hard to find but this place does it!  The holding them back is service, maybe we came on an off day. It took a long time for them to come take our order and then like 30 minutes for it to come out. And they forgot one persons order. They got his out fast but it all just felt mildly annoying.  Overall great place, give them a try!",

The bowls were huge, and I almost couldn't finish it. The noodles were not overcooked, the tender (non-rare) beef was good, but I think the soup was just okay and the tendon in my bowl didn't taste very fresh. I would come back because the value is pretty great, and the restaurant is conveniently located close to Red Line Chinatown stop, but if you're looking for a quality bowl of pho, you'd have better luck finding it up in Argyle.",

I arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes later and asked about my order and the waiter looked at me dumbfounded. He checked with the kitchen and they had the order, but they hadn't started it. It was a Wednesday afternoon and only somewhat busy. The small restaurant was half full, but most of the people had already received their food. They told me to have a seat and my order will be started.  I ended up waiting for over 30 minutes before I received my food, and I had to ask the waiter whether the takeout bag sitting on the counter was mine since he didn't realize it sitting there over 5 minutes after it came out of the kitchen. So all in all, over 45 minutes for a pickup, in which time I probably could have had it delivered to my house. Funny thing is I received an email asking about my experience ordering from their site before I even received my food.  The pho and spring rolls itself were decent, hence the 2 stars versus 1. The bowls for those dining in at the restaurants were really big, but it doesn't seem the takeout containers contain as much. Overall, I might try them again for dining in, but considering how long it took for them to bring out a bowl of pho on a slow day, I definitely wouldn't come on the weekend.",

Meat and noodle are evenly in the bowl! The owner was really nice and he came to our table to check on us. They open at 11, but the owner said they come in at 8 to start the soup base. No wonder the soup is so flavorful!  We went to Pho Cafe in a group of 12 for dinner. The waitresses were very accommodating and quickly got the tables set up for us. Service was friendly!  We ordered spring rolls, 5 different types of phos, honeymoon soup, 3 different types of dry vermicelli noodle dishes and 2 rice entrees. My family didn\u2019t mind me picking at their foods so I got to try them all and they were all good!

        "caption": "Cafe Hoang was replaced by Pho Cafe in February 2018. I have been coming here for 3 years , almost weekly with my sister. The prices remained the same and the pho bowls got bigger, this is clearly because the ingredient quality is cheaper. The beef in the pho is very chewy, the chicken is slimy, the crab rangoon has less ingredients (like the chives and whatever else they put in there to make it less cream cheesy), EVEN the hoisin sauce at each table is a cheaper brand. Now the broth, the pho broth lacked SO MUCH flavor, I had to drown it in sriracha and hoisin sauce to make it a little edible. I thought maybe we came on a bad day and gave it another chance and NEVER AGAIN will we return. I MISS YOU CAFE HOANG.",

Since the second day of opening, I have already ordered 3 times of this dish. By the way, the #20 pho (pig feet, pork blood with lemongrass pho) was so good too. If you like these ingredients, I suggest you to order and try for yourself.",
