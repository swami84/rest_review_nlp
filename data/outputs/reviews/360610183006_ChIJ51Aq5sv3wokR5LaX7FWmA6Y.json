First time I went there it was a full dish, absolute 5 star meal for me. But the 2nd and 3rd time I went I saw a different cook/server and the portions were considerably smaller. It's still the same plate, but he didnt pack it, it was rather loose as you can see on my photo. Enough for a meal, but I enjoy having leftovers x]",
