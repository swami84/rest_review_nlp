A line is a good sign, right?  -Then I looked Atrium Cafe up on Yelp- 3 stars. Hmmm...  -As I walked in, the coffee smelled good and the sizzling ham on the open grill looked like it was the making of the best breakfast sandwich in the city. The croissant they put it on was large. Did I stumble upon a hidden gem?  -I went to pay and my total for a ham, cheese, and egg breakfast sandwich and a medium coffee came to just under $9. Seems expensive.  -Then I went to sip the coffee. It was decent. It isn't third wave coffee, but alas. It's caffeine. The sandwich looks promising, but tasted a little bland.  I'm still processing my experience and all the mixed messages Atrium Cafe sent me. Who are they really? Age has taught me to not mess around with mixed signals.
