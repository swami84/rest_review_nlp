It is has pleasant d\u00e9cor with Thai influences that really get you into the feel of the place and matches the food.  Very good assortment of Thai classics and a large vegetarian selections for those that are on a plant based diet.  Everything comes beautifully plated when served.  The service is also excellent there.  Everyone is smiling and greet you upon entry.  Their is constant attention to service there and it seems very sincere .  Although being a meat eater, I was in an extra healthy mode the day I went and ordered the Chiang Mai's Evil Tofu with brown Thai rice.  It was excellent.  Didn't even miss not having meat at all.  The dish was perfectly cooked and exploding with flavor.  I really appreciated that when I requested the spice level to be \"Thai Hot\" that they actually did it.  Most places still back off on the spice when they see someone that is Caucasian.  This is a great place for a date or a small group.  It has a really good feel to the place and plan to go back again.  I do recommend trying this place if you are in the area.",

The atmosphere here isn't too formal in spite of the white tablecloths they use. The service at this restaurant was excellent. We ordered the spicy tofu (\u00e0 la carte veggie menu) and fish filet with chili (special menu). We got 1 brown rice and 1 sticky rice to go with these--why not mix it up, right??? The rice came in reasonable, non-gigantic, portions. In particular, the sticky rice they have here is amazing and it comes in a little basket which is cool. I would love to see coconut rice on the menu (someday maybe?). Both of our dishes were spicy and tasted good. I preferred the tofu to the fish filet they had that day. The fish in our chili fish filet did not taste fresh or good to me because it was not firm and had little flavor -- I will definitely order the market price fish when I come back here. A basic selection of wine and beer is available but the better wine is all sold by the bottle and beer is bottle only. I do not think they use the small bar in the dining room for seating customers.  It looks like they have a small parking lot, but you'll mostly be parking on King Street.",
