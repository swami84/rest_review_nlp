We ordered: Chopped Cheese, Philly Cheesesteak, Smashed Potatoes, Mac & Cheese, Tomato Salad, Chili, Corn Chowder, Moroccan Stew, Banana Pudding, Cookies, and a few bags of chips and snacks. We went back to the car and threw down! The chopped cheese was beyond! The smashed potatoes with ranch on the side was bomb! Chilli delish, Mac & Cheese needed just a little something...but it was creamy(we gave it the hook-up back at the house). I can't wait to go back for a pt.2. That tomato salad was the surprise of the night, salty/spicy/umami fresh! I added it to some kale the next day and enjoyed it all over again! He knows what he's doing. May have to head over sooner than I planned, typing this makes me want a chopped cheese right now!!",

But I decided to give Vodega a chance because what do I have to loose. After my first bite of Vodega\u2019s Cuban literal tears rolled down my face, it was that good!! I could go on and on but moral of the story, I HIGHLY recommend the Cuban sandwich.",
