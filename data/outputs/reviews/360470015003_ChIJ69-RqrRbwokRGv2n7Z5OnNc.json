        "caption": "(Translated by Google) Really. Heard about it on TV and thought give it a try. During my New York vacation with my son, we took the subway, 45 minutes on the road and then that. We couldn't find much positive. It is definitely not a Berlin doner kebab. Almost $ 13 + tip for a doner kebab? That is 4 times as much as it costs in Berlin! The meat was thick lumps from the warming container, very little in terms of quantity and the taste had only a little to do with a Berlin doner kebab. The red and white cabbage was completely missing for whatever reason and of course the chilli flakes. Additional spice powder on the kebab? What for? Maybe the makers should try again in Berlin to know how the original can and should taste. Good sauces are also important here. A sharp knife to cut the THIN strips of meat could also help. The only good thing was the bread. For $ 30 for 2 people without drinks, I wouldn't go back. P.S. The lemon juice that you put on it doesn't go well with it and I haven't had it in Berlin yet. No recommendation from me sorry. The review refers to summer 2019, maybe that's better now.  (Original) Also echt mal. Hatte im TV davon geh\u00f6rt und dachte mal probieren. Beim meinem New York Urlaub mit Sohnemann ab in die Subway, 45 Minuten unterwegs und dann das. Viel Positives konnten wir nicht finden. Ein Berliner D\u00f6ner ist das definitiv  nicht. Knapp 13 Dollar +Tip f\u00fcr nen D\u00f6ner? Das ist 4 mal so viel wie er in Berlin kostet! Das Fleisch waren dicke Klumpen aus dem W\u00e4rmebeh\u00e4lter, von der Menge her sehr wenig und der Geschmack hatte nur entfernt etwas mit einem Berliner D\u00f6ner zu tun. Das Rot- und Wei\u00dfkraut fehlte komplett warum auch immer und nat\u00fcrlich die Chilli Flocken. Zus\u00e4tzlich Gew\u00fcrzpulver auf den D\u00f6ner? Wof\u00fcr das denn? Eventuell sollten die Macher mal wieder in Berlin probieren, um zu wissen wie das Original schmecken kann und sollte. Gute Saucen sind auch hier wichtig. Auch ein scharfes Messer zum abschneiden der D\u00dcNNEN Fleischstreifen k\u00f6nnte helfen. Einzig gut war das Brot. F\u00fcr 30 Dollar f\u00fcr 2 Personen ohne Getr\u00e4nke, w\u00fcrde ich hier nicht wieder kommen. P.S. Auch der Zitronensaft den ihr drauf kippt passt so gar nicht dazu und habe ich in Berlin auch noch nicht gehabt. Keine Empfehlung von mir sorry. Die Rezension  bezieht sich auf den Sommer 2019, eventuell ist das jetzt besser.",

Really excellent lunch option especially if you have a big appetite and have time to sit down and eat your meal. The sandwich itself is huge, almost unwieldy, overstuffed with fresh veggies. It's definitely a messy meal no matter how you handle it but it's all worth it. What really makes this \"sandwich\" stand out is the crispy sesame bread. I wouldn't mind having less of everything else to have a better balance of the bread. One thing I have to say that the chicken in the kebab does pale in comparison to the bread, vegetables, and sauce. I found it a little on the bland side if eaten alone (without sauce and vegs).",

The price was a little high, about $11, but the doner kebab was fairly large and stuffed with tender chicken, pickled cabbage, feta cheese and other veggies.  I am a fan of the hot sauce that's included and the doner kebab is made on bread that's got a nice chewy texture.  I would definitely eat here again.",
