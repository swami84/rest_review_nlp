Open Table had confirmed our reservation for 6 at 1:00 pm, but when we arrived we learned that they opened at 3:00!  However, a manager soon appeared and said he would sit us down and serve us shortly.  The menu was blissfully short and very attractive.  Simba took our order and brought us two delicious complimentary starters (guacamole and fried calamari). We ate lobster rolls, hamburger and mussels, with the best French fries this side of the Pond. Each dish was excellent! At the end of our meal we were treated to three large tastings of their desserts of the day! A wonderful restaurant all around! We will be back!",

Apparently, there was a great deal of money spent on this build out but it  looks like someone went crazy with all the fixtures and didn't have a clear vision for what the place should look like or maybe they did? We counted at least eight different lighting fixtures. It feels like a sports bar, a diner, and restaurant hotel rolled into one. The view is so incredible they could have kept it super clean and modern. Doilies and placemats? Seems very dated.  It seems like it should be casual hence the sailor themed outfits of the wait staff that are not flattering (few people can wear horizontal stripes) and the managers are wearing full suits. The food is very safe and general and nicely executed, which is probably a smart move considering they will have a very varied clientele with all the tourists in the park. I wish the space was more appealing to sit in. I found it very distracting.",

The waiter was super nice and went over the whole menu and suggested a few items. We went with the Cheese Plate , which had variety of cheeses with jam. Also had the Grilled Calamari as the appetizer. For the main course we had the roasted Crystal Valley chicken and the painted Hills ribeye , they were both delicious. Presentation was top notch.  Ambiance - 10/10 Service - 10/10 Views - Excellent WiFi- Not Sure Large Groups- Yes Parking - Paid Garage around the corner  Definitely booking a table for July 4th . Best spot to have dinner watching the  fireworks.",

The restaurant has such a nice vibe to it. Very classy and upscale, but very relaxed and cozy feeling at the same time. It\u2019s very beautifully decorated and clean. Food was incredible. Very appealing to look at and eat. The food looked like something Gordon Ramsey would cook; I was quite impressed. They also have a nice drink menu and great options to choose from. I personally loved their soup and their fries. Their pecan pie was honestly the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Another great thing about this restaurant is they are very kid friendly. Overall a really great place to come with family or friends (or both) and enjoy a wonderful meal. Highly recommend!",

Estuary is pleasantly located along Brooklyn waterfront on Bridge Park Dr with a coveted view of the Financial District skyline.  I can\u2019t say much about the inside of the restaurant as we sat outside and soaked up the environment. Chef Danny Brown curated some decadent meals - we had the Caesar Salad, Salmon, Cream of Spinach and Branzino en Cocotte.  The dishes were all presented well, flavorful and very innovative (not surprise). The wine list, however, leave a lot to be desired.  I am very glad Chef Danny Brown is making waves in Brooklyn, but as a Queens residence, I feel the need to say, it all started in Queens. #estuarybrasserieandbar #chefdannybrown #dannybrown",
