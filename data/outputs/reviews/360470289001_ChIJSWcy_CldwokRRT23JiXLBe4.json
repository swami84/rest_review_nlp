Their spiciness is from chili oil, which isn\u2019t really spicy on its own. It was ready in 15 minutes, which came through in lack of flavor. The people are very nice, but sorry, it\u2019s a no from me.",

This is a community landmark! , been a customer for 15 years , never have they disappointed.

The new renovated look only complements the amazing food and people who work here.",
