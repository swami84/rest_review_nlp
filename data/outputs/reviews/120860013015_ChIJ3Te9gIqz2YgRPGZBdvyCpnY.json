Almost every single thing I've ordered is the best, or close to the best version I've had of it.  Great vegetarian options as well.  Staff is friendly, location is convenient, prices are fair.  Keep it up guys!",

Very friendly service, I didn\u2019t feel rushed ordering and they made my customizations without making me feel like it was a huge bother like I feel at other places. It\u2019s very cute inside as well! Food and smoothie was fantastic. The oatmeal cookie smoothie was top notch. This is how every establishment should aim to run their business. Very great experience.",

I know  they have new staff but there is no reason to  send a customer burnt broccoli, over cook and dried edamame and hard rice. They place has gone downhill. This use to be such a great resturant. I really don't know what's up with this place. But I won't be ordering from her again.  I wish I could put pictures in this review so I can show you what they sent me. This isn't the first time my order was made poorly, this is like the 5th or 6th time it's been like this. They don't take pride in  what they send to people. It's unbelievable!",

The food was amazing and you could tell they took there time with the orders, the food was tasty and fruits and vegetables  were fresh. Now the food is horrible! Something changed. The way the vegetables are cut, the avacado are dark green or sometimes  greenish brown. The plating of the food is bad, they forget to give you sauce.   We pretty much order the some thing everyday  and the food has been bad over the last 30 days.",
