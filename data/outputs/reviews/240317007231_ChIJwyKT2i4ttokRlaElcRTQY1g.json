We called them to have them send 2 replacements. Almost an hour later, no pizza had arrived. The person on the phone said she forgot to put in the order. So after the order was put in again, we got a hold of a manager who voided the original transaction and offered us 2 free pizzas for the future, which seemed fine. Except we still wanted the pizzas we'd originally ordered! We assumed he voided the cost of the original pizzas because we had been waiting 2.5 hours for our dinner at this point and they still had not delivered properly cooked pizzas. There had also been previous instance where we ordered a garden salad, and they sent the wrong one, so when we called about it, they asked if we wanted a chicken salad instead. My wife is vegetarian. This is unacceptable. Do not order from this location.",

Then i called again at 11:22 pm and then they said it will be there in 2 minutes. I am  not pressed on time but I hate when i order something and the associate could not give me a straight answer . Then once i had my order they got my pizza wrong.Then i called again and still no answer. So finally i drove to the store and 3 people were working. It took me 1.5 minutes to get there and i asked the driver did you have other delivers when you had my order and he said no. At the store the phone was ringing but only 1 person was working and the other two were standing around just talking. if i could give less than a star i would.",

When i went outside i had to walk all the way around to another building and when i tried to call him to ask where he was, i don't know what he said and i told him that, so he said \"OK\" then hung up. The reason i really rate this one star is cause i walked  around the corner and he automatically assumed it was my pizza when i wasn't even going up to him... he just saw me and handed me my order. then he TOOK the money out of my hand!! HE DID NOT UPDATE THE TRACKER so i had no way to rate the guy on the website.  His name was Julio. I rate him 1 star. He shouldn't work there if he does that again.",

When i called them next day asking why this happen the store manager was just like well wat am looking at the system is the tht driver tht took ur order it had 5 deliveries before yours. He didn't even apologize for the wait time or anything he only said i can't do anything about it i can only give you a 8 pieces of wings free. Wat type of store manager does this.",

This guy then used the same spatula they use to get the pizza out of the oven to pick up the mesh from the floor. I confronted the manager, then he made the unhygienic guy wash the spatula before further use.  So just imagine what's going around in the store when you order your pizza online. I love dominos pizza, but this is unacceptable.",

I didn't give him a tip because they charge you a $2.00 delivery charge& he's asking me if I want change? Took forever to get there, food was cold, and then asks me if I want change? That would have been a 50% gratuity. Don't order delivery from this store.",
