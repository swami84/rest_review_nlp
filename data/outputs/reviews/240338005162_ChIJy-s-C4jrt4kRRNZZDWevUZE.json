Had great service with cashier but when order was called for pickup it was in huge bag so we assumed all was there.  Was disappointed because the person who gave us order had just walked in on his shift and was rushing...Wasnt until we got home that we discovered there was only ONE order in the bag and not three (so two of us didnt eat)...smh. We were livid and I called the restaurant back to speak with the manager as I had just wasted over $25 hoping he would rectify the matter by sending a giftcard, etc or something via email or mail to me to rectify the mistake.  But he did not....instead he just said he was writing it down in \"some\" random notebook so that when ever returned to the store, the staff would somehow know what our food was free....REALLY?  Soo disappointing.  Will never visit this location again.  Sadly my daughter loves this food, but we will go elsewhere.  Owners need to really re-evaluate their staff.",

One of the employees\" Rain\" had such an attitude with every customer coming in to order or pick up their food. It was 11pm and the close at 12. Didn't let us eat in the lounge because it was supposedly close but I think they just didn't want anyone there. We ordered cajun fries and just got regular fries and told them but looked annoyed. Employees need better training on customer service....",

I was psyched to find out there was one close to me now but was sorely disappointed. First, I ordered online and only had the option to get EITHER mild OR garlic parm on each wing but I figured I could just call after placing my order and specify I wanted the 2 sauces mixed. Did so and was told, rudely, that no they couldn't mix the two. Whatever, I was still excited about the fries. Picked up my order and now I'll never go back. The garlic parm wings had no garlic. It was just a plain wing lightly dusted with the parm you put on your pizza. The fries had absolutely no seasoning on them...just plain fried potatoes. Even my tea from a machine, which just requires you to push a button, was wrong. I pushed \"unsweet\" and got \"raspberry.\" Never again!!!",

I ordered online ( order was confirmed) and when I got the store in Bowie, the store was close and the guy in the counter was giving us a sign that they were close... so, he got annoyed and opened the door and ask us why we were there- so we told him we are to pick up the foot we ordered and his reply was (in a very arrogant tone of voice) \u201cwe ran of something...\u201d and then we asked him about but we already paid for it? He responded - \u201cit cancelled\u201d. So, we believed him, guess what, after a few days - he charged us in our credit card. FYI: when you order on-line it takes a while for you to get your orders for pick up. From that point of time - the staff working around that time could have called the customers and let them know what\u2019s going on, especially if there is no ingredients or the order was cancelled... my point is, we ordered online for the convenience of doing it and it\u2019s not our fault that you ran out of ingredients or the staff was just feeling lazy to cook ( around 9pm and food to be picked up by 10pm and your store closes at 1145pm). You should have notified us or called us ahead of time!",

Today I called to place a carry out order during which I was interrupted repeatedly, was spoken to like I was bothering them by calling to place an order and with zero respect whatsoever, at the end of the train wreck of this one sided conversation they spewed out something that I think was how long the order would take and the total- I could barely decipher what they were saying because they mumbled with an attitude the whole time- and then they very quickly hung up the phone on me. For this reason alone I will no longer be calling in carry out orders from this place, it\u2019s a shame, because all it takes is some basic training and management, or someone to supervise, as clearly no one around this person is holding them accountable. I\u2019ve been in customer service for years and what I experienced today is just plain bad business, and as a first time customer it has completely turned me off to ever returning.",

He told her to give me 10% off bc my order wasn\u2019t ready and then proceeded to pull his wingstop shirt off while counting down his register as the \u201cbro\u201d waited for him with his huge bag of free food. The other employee tried to give me a coupon for 6 free wings but I let her know I would still be escalating it. It seems as if Brandon\u2019s behavior is okay\u2019d by upper management because he seemed VERY confident in disregarding paying customers to give free food to a friend/bro and clock out while changing clothes behind the register.",

Upon receiving the food, I realized that I was given this food in such a short timespan because they failed to properly cook the wings. I asked for all flats, and ended up receiving 5 drums and 3 flats. I'm honestly disappointed. It seemed like they were just trying to rush me out so they could close, as I was the last customer. But I feel like I should've been offered the same service as any guest  that came earlier than me. So yeah, a little disappointed.
