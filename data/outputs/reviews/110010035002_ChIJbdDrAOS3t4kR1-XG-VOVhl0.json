I love this place and that's the only reason I waited an extra 45 minutes in the restaurant after waiting 20 minutes at home after calling in my order. I understand it takes time to make the catfish, which is why I asked how long should I wait before coming in, besides that, I always come here and order the same thing (catfish, yams, and mac)  No apology for the wait and none of the servers informed me that my order was never called in and as such I was waiting behind 3 other people who had ordered. Although I declined, I wasn't offered any water until 20 minutes into my stay.  I expected much more and communication from the staff regarding my order would have gone a long way.  All in all, I waited an hour for my food. 20 minutes at home and a little over 40 there. Once I received my order, I was informed I could wait another 3 minutes for the corn muffin. I chose to leave.",

While my order was being made 3 other orders some how got placed, then they decided to hand write a ticket for my friend\u2019s order. The cook then said he had eggs for the other 3 orders but not the ticket that should\u2019ve gone in before those orders. My platter was made, but then the cook forgot the French toast as well. This place isn\u2019t worth the hassle, definitely taking my business elsewhere. Plenty of breakfast spots. This is a combined 1 star rating for the two times I\u2019ve been burned by this place. So 1/2 star per visit.",

        "caption": "I recently had the great displeasure of dining at Florida Avenue Grill. I wanted to like this place. It is no-frills and has historic value, which is often a marker of a good diner. However, due to the unfortunate reality of Florida Avenue Grill being terrible, I am forced to give it a commensurate rating.  Let\u2019s start with the good, which is quite a short list. As noted, Florida Avenue Grill is a historic establishment, and\u2014if you\u2019re lucky\u2014you may be seated in a booth in which MLK once sat. Of course, that is very cool. Additionally, my party was given two free coffees after our incompetent waitress tried to serve them to two toddlers. (Their parents had ordered \u201ccoffees,\u201d but surely did not expect the server to take this to mean that they would be putting coffee into their kids\u2019 sippy cups. If they had ordered beers, would the waitress assume that the kiddos were on the sauce?) The free coffee was undoubtedly a plus\u2014though the joe itself was not particularly good, and I have to assume that this is not the uniform experience of Florida Avenue Grill diners.  Now, upward and onward to the bad! The service at this restaurant is absolutely abysmal. We were actually seated fairly quickly\u2014which is, unsurprisingly, unusual for this place\u2014but it was downhill from there. When we were seated, our waitress slammed menus and water down on the table without a word. It took her a long time to circle back for our orders, and when she did, she was curt, unsmiling, and unhelpful. I attempted to order the biscuits and gravy, to which she replied \u201cwe\u2019re out\u201d in the same tone in which one might address . All in all, my party ordered simple items with no substitutions that the menu claimed were popular. This should have been an easy dining/serving experience for everyone involved. It wasn\u2019t.  My sausage and egg breakfast was supposed to come with a biscuit, which the waitress forgot (and then gave to me in a huff when I asked about it). My friend\u2019s breakfast was supposed to come with pancakes, which she was never served. Another friend ordered a side of corn muffins, which he never received, despite the fact that we could see them on a plate in the kitchen. All the server had to do was bring them over. The food itself\u2014if it actually makes it to your table\u2014is not fantastic, but about what you would expect: greasy and probably good for a hangover. My eggs and sausage were fine; however, the biscuit was like sawdust on the palate.  When it came time for the check, we were charged for the pancakes and muffins, even though we never received them. One of our party asked the server to amend this, and she removed the pancakes from the bill, but not the muffins. We asked if we could just get the muffins in a to-go box (again, we could see them on the plate and ready.) The server simply said \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this\u201d and walked away.  It is a sad, sad state of affairs if a restaurant as bad as this one is considered a neighborhood landmark. Florida Avenue Grill is not the best that breakfast has to offer, and my life is worse for having been there. Could I build a time machine, I would use it to go somewhere else for breakfast.  There are other diners in the area with charm, pleasant and competent staff, and food of equal or better quality. Go to one of those instead.",

Once I ordered my BREAKFAST sandwich on white I then said can you add butter and strawberry jam. My server said the couldn't put the butter and jam on the sandwich I would have to do it myself. I asked for the manager and told him about them not having wheat toast or being able to have the condiments added to my BREAKFAST sandwich. I then was told they did have wheat bread, but I still would have to put the butter and strawberry jam on myself. I asked how much the sandwich would cost. The server said $7 and change. I told them to discontinue my BREAKFAST order. You would think for that price they would have been a little caring and added the condiments to the sandwich. NOT TO MENTION THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER CUSTOMER IN THE STORE SEATED AT A BOTH AT 9:30 AM. I SEE WHY!!!",

Speaking of the wait, that's probably the only thing that I wasn't completely pleased with. If you're going to visit this spot, expect a wait. Plenty of folks are trying to get in to enjoy the food here most days. Once you get in though, you forget all about the wait, as the courteous staff help you get your meals. We had the pork chops with greens and they were very good. We also had the awesome fish and fried chicken (by the way, the chicken breast was so fresh and delicious, probably one of the most juicy I've ever tasted. The lemonade was on point as well. Definitely a spot I'll visit again and would recommend to visitors.",

I love their french toast! This is a breakfast place that I definitely enjoy frequenting. If you are ordering to go I do suggest checking your food. I would give them five starts but too often have I made the mistake of not checking my food and either being hungry because I didn't/couldn't eat it, or being irritated because I had to turn back around because hunger would not let me ket it go. It is definitely a DC treasure, Very homey. It is also very small so please if you are trying to come here, especially on the weekends, that wait can get intense. I normally go during the week when it's more chill. I have only eaten breakfast there but they do have an enticing dinner menu. The price is definitely reasonable and this place is historic, great pictures and stuff to look at. They got smaller cups, I peeped and I don't like that.",

We arrived to the facility early Saturday July 14, 2018 evening excited to visit and to eat. I wished I would have taken names because the 1st lady welcomed us in a pleasant tone and said to sit anywhere we'd like. Where we wanted to sit had dishes still on the table from previous customers.  There was a young man behind the counter and he had no problem clearing the table for us, however, another young lady had an attitude anyone can see and feel. I really wish I gotten her name because when she did approach she tried her best to ask how were doing while handing us the menus. My mom was ready to place her order as the rest of us were also ready, but this no mannered person was in no rush to take our order, yet she was the 1st to tell us to have a great day when we decided to leave without placing an order because my mom was becoming slightly irritated, which turned to agitated and ended with being aggravated. I really HATE that I didn't ask for this individuals name. I may not know her name but her description is short, light skin, and on the plump side.  She need to know her manners and and check the attitude because she doesn't know who maybe coming to patronize a historical institution, not only that but she doesn't know how big of a tip she probably would have received.",

On both trips the food has been great not totally constant in flavor but equally delicious.  I got the Big Bertha's Breakfast. Which is 2 very large hotcakes with cinnamon and sugar, 2 eggs, how you want and bacon with home fries on both days.  First the food.  Amazing on both days but better to me on the second visit. The home fries weren't a spicy and the bacon wasn't done quite as crisp on the second visit. Again great on both days just my personal preference. The rest of the family's food was also raved about.  Service on the two days was very different. The young lady, the shortest of the servers I saw, on our first day which was the busier of the two days was a delight. Checked on us frequently and was always ready for a refill. Took away plates as needed and was fast with the check and even faster with a smile.  The service on the second day from another server was nice but definitely lacking from the prior going lady. She started to bring our food while still not bothering with silverware for the table or napkins with two small kids. Only came around once for refills and then disappeared for the rest of the meal forcing us to ask another server, a taller lady with a beautiful African headscarf, for our bill and who also cleared the table.  I wish she had been for the whole time, as when we paid she was extremely friendly and asking us about our meal and how we found the restaurant which was from Google and Trip advisor reviews.",

I went there on New Year's Day for a traditional New Year's Day lunch of black-eyed peas, collard greens and pork chops, which is supposed to bring you luck for the new year, according to Southern tradition. I also had cornbread muffins, sweet iced tea, sweet potato pie and coffee with a side of mac and cheese. (I had leftovers and took them home for later.) Every bite was heavenly! The restaurant is a small, sometimes crowded, unfancy diner located in a dirt parking lot where you can park your car. I took the Metro, exiting at the U Street African American Civil War Memorial exit and walked three blocks North to the corner of Florida Avenue and 11th. The prices are very reasonable, and be sure to tip well. Those ladies (and gentlemen) work hard to make sure you're well taken care of.",

        "caption": "Last Friday evening, my wife and I googled local restaurants and came across the Florida Avenue Grill in our search. It was close to our hotel and it was a soul food restaurant. A win win situation, right? Wrong! We had the worse waiter EVER! I think his name was Ayinde. He never introduced himself so I'm going by the name on our bill. He took our order and his demeanor was really unpleasant and very unprofessional. We didn't get our drinks until after our meal was served. Speaking of our meal, they were both wrong. We still accepted it because we didn't want to be a bother to the seemingly irritated young man. We finished our meal, stacked our plates, and wiped down our area to let him know that we was ready for our check. He walked by several times ignoring us. The waitress that was fairly new there gave us refills while we waited and she was very warm and friendly. She was the complete opposite of Ayinde( if that was his name). After patiently waiting for our check, my wife overheard him say to the waitresses to give us our bill as if we were carriers of the Ebola virus. My wife had enough and gave our bill, payment, and a tip to the friendly waitress that gave us our refills. I'm sure the Florida Avenue Grill is a great place but our waiter's unprofessional conduct put a damper on this great restaurant's name.",
