My labneh pita sandwich was mouth watering goodness. If you know you enjoy labneh and pickles and Israeli salad omg sooo yummy. I ordered on seamless my delivery came fast and the food was all fresh and aromatic. I also really enjoyed and recommend the meat cigars.  They were delicious.  Great food and fast accurate delivery.  I will definitely be ordering again soon or stopping by.",

The staff is very friendly and welcoming! Backyard takes you to warm chill summer evenings with fresh craft beer and awesome music! Will come in again! Highly recommended!",

Sat socially distanced in back courtyard and dined on delicious shawarma chicken pita.  Will come again. The owner personally greeted us and shared that all items are made fresh daily including the pita bread.  And it showed.  Thank you Josh for making our date night special!",

The staff is so friendly and the chef/owner himself has recommended a few items during my visits. Overall the food is flavorful, savory, and fresh. From their Bites, I've tried the Kubeh, Moroccan Cigars, and Sumac Fries - seasoned with great authentic spices and sauces to die for like the their house hot sauce ('harif'). From their Salads, I loved the Sabich Salad and Schnitzel Salad - fresh and healthy green mixes balanced with tahina and a lemony-tangy dressing on the side. My boyfriend is the biggest sweet tooth so I can't forget to call out their Sweet Chocolate Malawach and Tahina Shakes (try the date one!) - you can't find these anywhere else! This will continue to be my go-to spot in the neighborhood! Lastly, the selection of craft beers and backyard area is perfect to take some time to relax and enjoy the summer.",

My girlfriend and I had the falafel sandwich and the shnitzel salad, I had a beer, and she had a tahina shake (first time I ever heard of such a thing but it was soooooo good). I went to sleep that night just wanting more of those flavors in my mouth. We will probably go back today or tomorrow again, I need more of that freshness. Thanks Josh for the great service and awesome food! Love that awesome Harif sauce!",
