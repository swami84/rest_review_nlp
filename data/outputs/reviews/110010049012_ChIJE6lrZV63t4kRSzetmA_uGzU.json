All i can say is drop everything you are doing now and GO!!!!!!!!!! The owners are soooo kind they recommended the perfect dishes for us. I ordered a veggie platter along with the Tibs , it was great because we tried a little bit of everything. My mouth is actually watering as I type this. The inside of the restaurant was beautiful decorated i actually felt like I was in Ethiopia. This is my new go to spot please do your self a favor and try this amazing amazing place locally owned restaurant. Food is 11/10. Service 11/10. Atmosphere 11/10.  P.S If you're a coffee lover ask about the buna!",

This amount could probably feed about 6 people.  Literally almost all of the dishes we tried were really good. I couldn't tell you exactly what was what (it came in 2 gigantic to-go containers) but my family really enjoyed everything. Especially the injera - amazing.  Compared to other Ethiopian restaurants, the prices are very reasonable, especially considering the amount of food you get. (The owner also gave me a free container of homemade yogurt which was very sweet!)  I highly recommend this place.",

The first place I went to was closed, the second place (the Ambassador) was dimly lit, loud and none of the patrons were wearing masks. So I eventually ended up here hoping for the best and I'm glad I did. It's hands down the best Ethiopian in DC. Not only is the food amazing and well priced, the women who run it are very hospitable, attentive and polite but don't hover and give you space to enjoy your meal and the restaurant itself is quiet, clean and well decorated. There were also outlets and I was able to charge my phone while I ate. Definitely highly recommended.",
