The food came and the presentation was gorgeous, as you will see by the pictures, and it tastes even better than i expected.

The food was great, I came with a party of 4 and we all really liked our meals. it\u2019s a test kitchen so the menu is a little more innovation. We ordered the chicken and waffles, BLT, and the cheesy (egg sandwich). The bacon on the BLT was exceptional, it had chunks of real bacon, not strips, that were cooked beautifully. The fruit sides were also very fresh, and did not include honeydew or cantaloupe (to me this is a positive as I think those fruits never taste good in a fruit salad, are cheap, and are usually underripe). I also got the iced horchata oat milk latte, which was pretty good, though it was $6 and 75% ice so I wouldn\u2019t recommend their iced drinks. It is a little on the higher end of price range for breakfast (expect to pay around $15 or more for an entree, and about $6 or more for any speciality coffee drink), but you can taste the quality difference.",

But when we showed up, the lady told us there was a 40 minute wait for only my husband and I to get a table. We decided to wait it out. As they called group after group (who had come in long after us), we still waited. We were waiting well over an hour and even talked to the hostess a few times, but never were given a table. Finally just grabbed a coffee and walked to chipotle. Disappointing, since this place was well-rated and the place looked nice. \ud83d\ude15  Side note, after walking a few blocks, ordering meals, and eating our food, we walked back to our car and happened to look in the window of the cafe... and a couple who had been seated long before we left STILL had no food!

It had been a while since we've been and after going to the dentist, we needed some sustenance in our tummies and pronto! So we decided to go to the Test Kitchen. Thankfully we didn't have to wait long to be seated and we had a fabulous waitress named Rani to take care of us. We each ordered something different... the hubby chilaquiles, the daughter Nutella crepes and I got their California omelet. (Pictures attached) The hubby ordered an eggnog cold brew and I got the Americano coffee. I have to say that I was VERY impressed with that eggnog cold brew, it was so much better to drink than my Americano! LOL! The Americano was a little too strong for my taste but the hubby liked it. When our food arrived, everything was perfect! The food was nice & hot and beyond tasty! Rani was there to answer questions about the food and even told us about some other items on the menu that we can try. She was a great person to talk to. I haven't had a bad meal there... and I hope that I never do. The first time we went, we have their KFB which is fried pork belly..  OMG, it was amazing!  A side note... when our plates were being picked up, a made a comment to the young man that I wished that they sold their jam. He said that he would ask the manager if they did. He comes back to let us know that they do and asked if we wanted to purchase some! Oh yes!!! Homemade jam is MY JAM!! LOL! We got the jam, paid and left with a \"Happy New Year\" from the barista!  People are just great there... can't wait to go back!",

        "caption": "I have now been to Yolk several times. I get that it's a test kitchen, but it sure seems like the staff are test as well. I have had disinterested to rude service each time I have gone. This last time was the worst though, as I ordered a coffee that never showed. Halfway through the meal I asked again, and got it, with no offer for a refill when it was emptied. We were never given a third silverware wrap for the third person at our table (a table for four mind you). We ended up taking another water off a table near us, when our water ran out. Our server was busy, but seemed disinterested at best. Two of our three meals were brought by a runner, who never returned with the third meal. We had nearly finished our meals when the server finally showed up to check on us, realizing the third meal never arrived. The manager gave us $2.00 off the meal that arrived for our third person, as we finished our other meals, which we didn't even ask for. The food was eh-okay. It's Chicago, there are a thousand other places you could go, I would recommend trying any one of them before coming here. 2-stars for the tasty hot sauce and the red-velvet pancakes I ordered the first time I went. Before you think I am just some jerk who either has too high of standards and/or leaves bad reviews for wanting something in return: 1) This is one of a few bad reviews I have EVER left for a place out of the hundreds I have reviewed. 2) I did 7+ years working in all aspects of restaurants through high school and college. I know what good service is and what bad service is. This one is the latter. The pretty good food definitely does not make up for that in a place like Chicago. I usually give the benefit of the doubt, but several bad experiences tipped me over the edge on this one.",

The staff of wonderful servers and cooks, are artists. Food is an expression of the people cooking it. You can eat anything from \u201cso spicy your mouth will burn,\u201d to \u201cso sweet it will warm you up.\u201d You actually feel the good vibes while eating there. Yolk is a Chicago staple. They have branched off to different states, as well!  Stop in to one of their restaurants, you will not be disappointed. Peace and love, Yolk rules!! \u2014\u2014Jon",

Everyone seemed to enjoy what they were eating, especially as we tried to order off their test kitchen menu and not the standard one. The reason why I only rated it three stars was because there was a bug in my greens. Apparently, it wasn\u2019t the first time that it happened and it had something to do with them not being washed enough. The manager was great about it though, so my experience was saved. Overall, a good concept and I\u2019m glad it was open to the public.",
