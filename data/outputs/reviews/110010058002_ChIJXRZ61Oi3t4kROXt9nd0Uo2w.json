First the interior is bigger than you think it is, sitting a good amount of people even with the COVID restrictions. When it came to the 'revolving' part of the restaurant, there was none, not sure if it is COVID related or not, but there was no sushi going around to the tables, everything had to be ordered touch screen. When it came to ordering, some took a lot longer than others to arrive. There were times we had to get our waiter to check on our order in the back. Coming down to taste, it was really good for the price you're paying, and its a overall fun experience. They have choices (for people like me) who have allergies and can't eat raw fish.",

        "caption": "First review of the New Year, and what do I choose to review?  The dinner I ate on New Year's Eve to celebrate the end of 2020 and welcome 2021! Such an amazing sushi dinner to start off the New Year!  I have been craving good sushi for quite some time.  I usually get my fix annually when I go back home to Hawaii or visit California.  But with the current pandemic we are in, I was not able to travel, so you can only imagine my cravings for delicious sushi was 5/5.  Well you know what?  I also rate Kura Revolving Sushi Bar a 5/5!  Now, Kura is not your high-end sushi establishment.  It is more of an economic-means of enjoying sushi, sushi on a budget, and sushi done right!  Finally DC has an establishment that does sushi right at a decent price!  Food: 5/5 Flavors: 5/5 Quality: 5/5 Rice Quality: 5/5 Service:  4/5 COVID Safety: 5/5  Overall: 5/5  There currently is no indoor dining, and especially with a rotating belt sushi establishment, it is definitely not smart to have indoor dining at the point in the pandemic.  But you know what, you can still order takeout and it still travels well, especially with the cold weather ;-)  My biggest pet-peeve with budget-sushi is the poor quality of the rice and the amount of rice they give per piece.  Kura was able to get both right, perfectly cooked sushi, with a hint of sushi vinegar, the rice is still slightly warm, and it has a smaller amount of rice, compared to other places.  Definitely a plus!  The menu offers a wide variety of nigiri, gunkan, rolls, ramen, rice, and fried items.  Oh, did I mention...they also offer dessert!  The flavors are BOMB!  Reminds me of Genki Sushi, which I frequently eat at in Hawaii (originated from Japan) and Kura hits the home run for getting the flavors right!  Each bit, packed with flavors, you can distinguish each grain of rice (I hate overcooked sushi rice) and I would say the fresh is pretty fresh for what you can get in the DMV area.  My favorites are the spicy tuna, spicy yellow tail, salmon skin roll, spicy garlic popcorn shrimp roll (not very spicy), and of course, the california roll.  What's also great is for Shogatsu, or the New Year, Kura offered an assorted nigiri special that came with 18 pieces.  Such a great way to try a variety of nigiri in one meal.  Definitely can't wait to come back for some more!  I almost went again the next day and the day after that, but refrained haha.  Kura will definitely be a place I will come at least twice a month!  My only issue I had was when I picked up the takeout order, the server forgot my Crispy Fried Chicken, and when I asked about it, he said he forgot to tell me that they were out.  The other issue I had was I was not given any Shoyu (soy sauce), wasabi, or ginger, so that was a bummer.  Good thing I had all that at home!",

I've lived in Japan before and visited numerous other times as well and, as a result, have accumulated a fairly good amount of experience with conveyor belt sushi restaurants.  The multi-level conveyor belt system is very nice\u2014better than even many establishments in Japan. The lower level circulates a variety of dishes for you to pick if any catch your fancy, while the upper level delivers the dishes that you personally ordered via the monitor at your table. It even has the receptacle for you to place the plates that you've finished eating, thereby automatically tallying the total number of plates you've eaten, which makes check out quick and easy. Just as with many establishments in Japan, once you've finished eating, there's a button on the ordering monitor that lets you notify the staff that you're ready to pay the tab, eliminating the need to signal and wait for your waiter to bring you the check.  The sushi itself is pretty decent. Obviously don't go in expecting top notch sushi. Conveyor belt sushi is meant to be cheap and fast, but even so, the quality here is better than what I've come to expect from conveyor sushi restaurants in the US. Service was good as well\u2014attentive and prompt.  The only negative thing I can mention is the pricing. For a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, I felt the prices were just a little bit high for each plate. However, it's the US. Sushi is almost always gonna be expensive. I don't think this is something that they can do much about, so I'm refraining from deducting a star.  Lastly, due to covid I assume, soy sauce and wasabi must be poured and provided by the waiter, which means you'll need to call your waiter if you need refills. This is kind of a nuisance, but is very understandable given the health hazards that would be posed if they were left at the table and were exposed to all the different customers.  Overall an experience that quite closely matches what you'd get in Japan, which makes sense since Kura is a Japanese chain, but it nonetheless exceeded my expectations.",

My glass of water was empty all these time. The waiter wasn\u2019t sure of the prices, items or operation. She was confused and speaker really slowly. The plastic utensils were placed on the table without any regard for Covid procedures. Waiter mask was below the nose. The service was unrealistically slow (just a few customers). There was a week old cucumber stuck to the bottom of my ordered dish... In conclusion, the franchise is amazing, but they should change the whole staff.",

        "caption": "I had a positive experience. It just opened this Saturday and I had been fixing to try it. Before I talk about about the food I\u2019ll say a couple of things about the ordering concept. The conveyor belt concept is DIFFERENT and it takes a moment to get the hang of but it is super cool and efficient. There is a wait staff there to assist with orders but the conveyor really serves its purpose to get food out to you from the sushi chef/cook to your table.  The food on the top conveyor comes directly to your table. There is another conveyor below that has a display of the food but it seems like they are not actively using it.  As far as the sushi went it was pretty good! I felt the rice was fresh and the right amount of stickiness and the the quality of the fish was pretty good. I was not a huge fan of the Texas roll but it sure tastes like the sushi embodiment of texas. As far as sushi there is a huge variety so really its a place that\u2019ll keep you coming back to try more.  The fried items like Takoyaki, Gyozas and Sesame balls were really tasty and came out nice warm. I really enjoyed the Takoyaki, it had a nice texture, complimented with a nice sauce and garnish. It\u2019s definitely worth trying but it does have Octopus.  The portioning of the food is great, it\u2019s nice to be able to try many different menu items and not feel bloated afterwards.  For the atmosphere. It is a tight space but they have make efficient use of it. The group booths are very private with high backs so it feels like a much more intimate experience. If you go alone they have bar style seating where you can sit alone in front of a ordering display. Pretty sure they are social distancing people in those seating.  I really like being able to order off the display, especially during covid times. In general I enjoy it just because I like to just be in my own thoughts or enjoying company and not being distracted throughout my meal.  Overall the food is worth trying and a welcome addition to Chinatown. Great value and fun-wide menu that gives you the opportunity to have a new and distinct meal every visit.",
