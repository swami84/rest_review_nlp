(Assuming he was boss in white coat) At first I made a reservation and they wanted to seat us by the door(it was cold) asked to go in back and he said at first \"no theres fine\" I asked we made a reservation no one on the whole place why cant we move away feom the door? \"Fine, whatever\". Then went to sit down, blinds completely closed.. I went to open them and then heard him say to our waiter, \"go tell that girl to stop touching everything\". (Would you rather the server reach other 2 people to open the blinds for us?? Verse contaminate one little shade, after I had just sanitized my hands?? Mind you... we closed down the place... no one else was coming in. Then.. the server kept asking what else we wanted like we were such an inconvenience being customers.. sushi good but wont be back now.",

The fish they serve is by far some of the best quality I've been served anywhere, and the creativity doesnt overshadow the flavors at all. They aren't too fussy with the rice or the extra sauces, which the chef/owner Bat makes himself in house, and what they do serve with the fish (if anything at times) compliments the natural taste of the fish very well. I can't speak enough of the caliber of the food they serve up, and they are uber friendly to boot. Bat will actually stop by your table regardless of how busy it is and spend some time getting to know you and your likes/dislikes when it comes to sushi. If you mention not liking a certain type of fish he will make sure that you leave Sushi Mon absoultely in love with it first! Every experience is truly remarkable and unique in its own way as long as you give up all control to the chefs. Kudos!",

I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  I'm not going to be cliche in this review by calling it the best sushi in the city, but it certainly is up there.  It rivals some of the best and more upscale sushi places throughout the city (read: Japonais, Sai, etc.) and at a fraction of the cost.  The owner/chef was happy to make a selection for us on our request, and everything he made was fresh, innovative and delicious.  It's not really a dine in sort of place, but if you manage to get a table you'll enjoy it thoroughly.  Stop by one of the many liquor stores and pick up a bottle of sake or white wine as it's BYOB.  Give it a shot, I'm sure you'll really enjoy it.",
