They made the fare look absolutely scrumptious, was artfully plated and even though my be youngest daughter is 8 years old, she was appreciative of it. We all felt so normal again for a little while, it was great. I used to come here for their brunch about once a month when my daughter would be in her ballet class and I was so pleased to be able to come inside for indoor dining and enjoy such a delicious and affordable meal with my DD's. Will be coming in regularly again as long as they remain open! By the way, they have an awesome outdoor dining space on their back deck. I mean it's really nice. Please come in and support our restaurants!",

Honestly, every experience is excellent, and they have really transformed their menu, service, and found their niche. Me and my girlfriend love going to this place and it is one of the best establishments in Bay Ridge. Their brunch menu is fantastic with loads of options, vegan and non vegan, healthy and not so healthy. Their burgers and steak do not disappoint and their fries are also always crisp, fresh and tasty. Don\u2019t let the facade fool you, the inside is nice and clean and their backyard is well lit and thoughtfully decorated. Definitely check this place out. Also their frozen drinks are refreshing!",

It's a nice welcome to the Bay Ridge area and offers a cozy area to meet for the 18 to 35 crowd moving to the area. Pricing is reasonable and meat is top grade. And it is not open for breakfast but has lunch brunch and dinner menus. After all it is a wine bar. The selection of wine is large and at moderate pricing. Food is definitely above average. While the lighting may not be inviting for intimate meetings, it is a comfortable place for a casual date. Want to come in alone? It's a friendly place that is totally non-intimidating. I hope it finds a following to make this business successful",

I was very disappointed those 5 times I have been there. Their food taste super unhealthy and salty just terrible even their smoothies were very disappointing. Besides the food what makes this place worst is their customer service. They never welcome you or greet you and they always look miserable and ride. You cant ask them any questions both the guy and girl there suck with their rude and cocky attitude. This place is always empty everytime I went I was the only one there and still they never greeted me and if i asked for recommendations or anything about the food they look super bothered. I dont know who the people are that gave them 5 stars but I wouldnt be suprised if they write their own reviews I think most their customers are ordering delivery so they dont deal with the nasty rude attitudes these people have. I will not be returning there. Its super expensive for horrible food and service.",
