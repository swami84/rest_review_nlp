        "caption": "My experience was horrible with D Cuisine! I ordered directly from the restaurant\u2019s website for a future order at 10:15 am pick up on Saturday, Dec 5th. I ordered at 9:35 am and the website said that 10:15 am was available for pick up. Restaurant listed online and on window of restaurant that they are opened at 8 am. The time they actually opened is at 10:30 am. I have called in the past to order my food and someone mentioned that they will be opened at 10 am.  Unfortunately, I arrived at 10:10 am and the lights were off and the D Cuisine was NOT opened. It finally opened at 10:30 am.  I got there and asked if my 10:15 am order was ready for pick up, the young woman worker-CiCi stated that it will be another 15 minutes. First, I was promised 10:15 am. Second, they charged my credit card already. My order was paid for. Third, I had to deal with an unprofessional CiCi who just said that she came late to work and sorry for being late. I asked for the manager's name. CiCi refused to give me her manger\u2019s name or contact information.  Regardless, if you are open or not, don\u2019t allow customers to order ahead on your direct website if you are going to be late or not open until 30 mins after the stated time.  When I came back after 15 mins like CiCi said, she said my turnip cakes were not ready yet. I overheard her speaking Cantonese to the cook and stated that I was \u201carrogant\u201d customer. I am not arrogant because I called you on being 30 mins late to work. Making a paying customer wait 33 mins extra when you promise food at a specific time and to call a customer \"arrogant\" in a different language does not make it okay. This is unacceptable.  I spoke back to her Cantonese instead of English. CiCi was surprised that I spoke fluent Cantonese. Not only was CiCi being unprofessional for showing up late but to call a paying customer \"arrogant\" is not acceptable regardless if you think I don't spoke the language or not.  Finally , I got my order at 10:48 am, 33 mins after the promised time and CiCi who refuses to give me the manager\u2019s name. This is unprofessional and unacceptable. I will make sure, I contact the BBB about the horrible service I received.  I later called D Cuisine around 8 pm, to find the manager of D Cuisine. CiCi answered and told me that Benny was the name of the manager and he was not at the restaurant currently. About 1 hour later, Benny gives me a call and poor excuses for the misleading information out there opening times and excuses for the lateness of CiCi. He informed me that CiCi is actually the OWNER OF D CUISINE! I was shocked by this. How do you have the OWNER asking their manager to call me back, when clearly she could have handled it because you are the owner. I wanted to support local businesses during pandemic, but this experience makes it hard to do so.  I told Benny how unprofessional and unacceptable this experience was. He refunded my order, but if this was handled properly to begin with, this should have been done right when I got my food at 10:48 am (33 minutes after promised time).",

We were pleasantly surprised but the food. On Sundays, street parking on Clark is free and no hassle finding a spot mid afternoon. Yay! Unlike some of the grungier places you'll find in Chinatown, inside D Cuisine is modern, sleek, and CLEAN.  For food, started with an order of siu mai. While it was past normal dim sum hours they were still able to make a fresh order for us. Very good!  In addition, also did a veggie dish (snow pea tips) topped with fried tofu. Pretty good! And an order of black bean and pepper beef chow fun. Not bad either. Lastly, the salt & pepper fish fillet was what I was craving most, but sadly it was the most disappointing of all the dishes we ordered. Way too much batter/breading. :'(  Aside from the fish fillet, still an overall solid spot and will save me a trip from going all the way down to Chinatown.  'Til next time.",

Passed by this place last time I was in Lakeview and it made me want to go in and try it but I wasn't the slightest bit hungry then. Luckily the next time I was in Lakeview I was hungry and there were empty tables that were filling up at a steady pace. We ordered a few dim sum dishes and I ordered a vegetable main dish as Chinese vegetables are well-suited to my tastes. I ordered Dry Pot Cauliflower with meat paste and it came out at the end of the meal. I was initially dismayed to see whole chilies and chili flakes in the dish since even though I enjoy spicy food I can no longer eat it very well. It was sizzling in its pot and came with rice for both of us. The cauliflower looked closee to romesco in color but whatever kind they used it was delicious. There wasn't a lot of meat but the dish had a fantastic flavor and not too much heat. I look forward to going back to try other chef's specialties on the menu but I will also definitely be ordering this again.",

Great service.  We had hoped for a small portion of veggies for dim sum, but it's not on the menu.  Oh well.  To our surprise, the waiter brought us a small dish of chinese broccoli with oyster sauce complimentary.  It was nice to have some greens!  Hahah.  My only recommendation would be to add a small plate vegetable option to the dim sum menu.  Will absolutely be back!",
