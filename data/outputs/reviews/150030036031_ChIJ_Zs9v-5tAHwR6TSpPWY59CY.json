The place is small and very busy, so it might be best to go early or go later after prime eating times.  We went for lunch at about 1130am and wish we got there a little earlier.  It didn't affect the wait time, but it was just very busy with other customers and got a bit noisy.  This place has some of the best fried mandoo I have ever had.  Cooked fresh to order they come out hot yet not oily at all.  They have the right balance of wrapper and filling.  The filling is very tasty,  The Bulgogi soup was amazing.  Lots of yummy stuff in a piping hot broth that was slightly spicy with a sweetness from the bulgogi meat.  It was over the top good.  Also ordered the mussels in broth which was a perfect light broth with seafood flavors from the mussels which were generously portioned.  This place does is BYOB if you like to have a beer with your Korean food like I do, so take note.  Everyone working there was very nice and the food came out quickly.  I think this place might become my regular from now own.",

There are one or two other Korean restaursnts but I could not identify the taste of food at those places...  anyway, the owner lady is very kind to the guests. Recommended dishes - kalguksoo, ttukbokggi, jaeyukbokgum...  but do not order ramen as it costs whopping USD 9 for a bowl of Korean instant noodles.  You can buy Shin Ramen bowl at 7/11 or other convenient stores.",

For my first time here I decided to try the kim chee fried rice because that's what I was craving. It was really delicious, but I could only finish the egg that sits on top and about 1/4 of the rice because there is so much. We also had the meat jun which was pretty good, even though I am not a huge fan of meat jun in general. The sides that they bring to the table are super super yummy. My favorite is the pickled onions with jalapenos, and the tsukemono (I dont know the korean word). The kimchee was pretty good as well but had a little fishy taste to it that i wasnt a huge fan of.  I cant wait to come here again to try the other things.",
