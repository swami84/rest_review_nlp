I couldn\u2019t tell, I just spit it out into a napkin and dared not to look. The poori bread arrived cold and soggy.  Also the restaurant had a coupon for a free soda when you spend over $30. Despite calling and telling the woman on the phone SPECIFICALLY the kind of soda I wanted, the soda still went missing. I had to call again and ask for the soda to be delivered. I feel bad for the delivery guys, but bad management affects everyone.  We will not be ordering from Indian Kitchen again.",

We ordered samosas and cauliflower apps, the samosas were especially flavorful and the sweet chili sauce on the cauliflower was so good! For entrees we had chana masala, chicken tikka masala, Rogan Josh and chicken korma; all the dishes were flavorful but mild spice level, my next visit I will ask to kick up the spice. After dinner, we were served complimentary rice pudding, unique flavor for kheer, tasted like it included carrot but still sweet.  They do not serve any alcohol but you can bring your own.",

I moved here recently and, of course, one of the most important things to figure out was what foods are near me. First off, I am a huge fan of Indian cuisine. I used to travel really far just for some delicious vegetable samosas and mango lassi, but now I found my new home lol. Indian Kitchen has over 100 dishes freshly cooked by amazing cooks and served by the nicest waiters I have ever met. Everything about Indian Kitchen is beautiful. The music, the atmosphere, and the decor makes you feel like you're warped into a totally different culture and it's a beautiful experience. They show you love and appreciation every time you walk through the door. I've been here like 5 times lol and got a complimentary dessert from the owner (Monju) himself. Overall, I really love Indian Kitchen and I just wanted to show my appreciation through this amazing review ;-)",
