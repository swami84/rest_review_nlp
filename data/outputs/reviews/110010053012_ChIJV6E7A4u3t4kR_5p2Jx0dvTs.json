So a bigger entree is the same price as a small appetizer- which seems unfair.  A chili wonton is $15 versus a Walnut shrimp.  So if u r savvy, I would stick with the larger entrees and skip the drinks as the drinks were definitely not worth $15.  The flavors are amazing and authentic. The service - we sat outside was very good. They had someone stationed outside and he was very attentive.  Tall white guy.  Also a note - it\u2019s super spicy - anything in the description that says Chilli oil is very spicy, so stay away from those if you r not into it.  The location is great and we had a great time.  All the restaurants now post covid have tables outside and even right on 17th.",

Astoria DC was one and it was truly a memorable experience. We arrived early around 6 and tables were already full - larger groups were being placed on a call back list and the two of us were promptly accommodated at limited standing room at the bar to await a private table. We were offered the option of seats at a communal table also. Prompt service from one of the many bartenders provided a Bourbon Smash and Moscow Mule.  As soon as the table for 2 opened we were quickly seated and proffered dinner menus and suggestions from our bartender who also served as our waitress.  Moving to classic Old Fashioned with Dan Dan noodles and spicy Chili Wontons to start followed by mild but tasty Walnut Shrimp and very spicy La Zi Chicken with rice to temper the heat.  Excellent cocktails, phenomenal food and service - wishing Dallas had more unique and eclectic places like this.",

TL;DR - food was bland, portions were tiny for $14 each. Good atmosphere, cute space.  The dan dan noodles were great - the noodle texture was perfect and it had a mildly numbing spiciness. The only complaint is that the bowl was pretty small only 4-5 mouthfuls of noodles.  The eggplant was fantastic in texture but oh so incredibly BLAND. Like it felt like I was just eating crispy fried oil that was the only flavor I got from it. Eggplant in Chinese cuisine is traditionally cooked with garlic, some sort of chili oil, light & dark soy sauce with a bit of sugar for flavor but I could only really taste oil in this dish, not even the basil. The texture gave me such high hopes because eggplant can be quite a difficult vegetable to cook.  The water boiled beef was ok. There was more flavor but it was still a bit bland, and the peppercorn dominated the flavor so much that there weren\u2019t really many other flavor profiles. In addition there were only like 6 pieces of beef in the whole thing..?  Also the dishes came out one at a time and not close enough together and in a useful order, like the blandness of the eggplant might have been better if I could dipped it in the sauce/broth of the water boiled beef but by the time we had finished the eggplant we had to a wait a bit before the beef had come out.  Overall probably wouldn\u2019t go back unless I was in the area and had an insatiable craving for Dan Dan noodles.",

The drinks are ALL good. I don't normally drink more than 1 drink, and find myself ordering 2 or 3 each time I'm here because they're that good.  Food is also always amazing, and very very similar to the Szechuan food I grew up eating. Get the water boiled beef. Just do it. It's not as spicy as you think it is because it's 'mala', or numbing, rather than a hot spicy. i've brought friends who couldn't eat a lot of spicy foods and they have all loved this dish. In fact, order everything on the menu because it's just that good.  Staff are always friendly and helpful with the menu, as well! Come here early on the weekends to avoid a wait, but even if you have to wait, it's well worth it.",

Music was playing a moody blues mashup of southern rock and British blues. It was a great compliment to the Art Deco interior and low yellow lighting.  I occupied one of the four (!) chairs at the bar - two on each end. There are no seats directly in front of the bar, which makes it feel a bit like a service bar. Tables line the wall with a narrow pathway between. There\u2019s booths and some larger party seating (probably six at most) on either end of the restaurant.  The server was quick and nice. She gave me some recommendations and away I went.  It\u2019s indisputable that the food here is excellent. Came out quick, hot, and generously portioned for 2 people. At $14 a pop, that\u2019s about right. I ate my fill and had enough left over for lunch.  The drinks were also good. From my perch, I watched the female bartender churn away at all manner of libations. She was calm and efficient in her technique. Her rye old fashioned was particularly delish - nailing the spot between booze forward and sweetness with that hint of orange that makes these so drinkable. Bravo.  Several times I observed folks come out from the BoH to help clear dishes and check on guests. I think that shows a true team spirit and ownership amongst the employees. The manager should be commended for his leadership - that sort of teamwork isn\u2019t dictated, it\u2019s born of a common love of service that can only be nurtured in a safe environment.  All in all, an excellent experience.",

Tried a number of the signature cocktails and food and we were pleasantly surprised with everything we got. The water boiled beef was really cool, and had a different type of spice profile than I'm used to where it sort of numbs your tongue instead of providing intense heat like some other Szechuan dishes do. The interior of the restaurant was also unique and gave it a fancy vibe.  The only complaint I have about Astoria is that the service we received was somewhat lackluster. We had a table for most of the evening and had to constantly flag waiters down to buy more drinks. Everything on the menu including food is $14 a pop which is rather expensive, and we would of spent a lot more money if the service was more attentive.  Overall worth the visit, but next time I'll be sitting at the bar.",

With only 40-some odd seats, Astoria is small but gorgeous. It's modeled after the original bar at NYC's Waldorf-Astoria. There's a very 1920s/1930s Art Deco vibe with the brass finishes, long bar with no stools, and comfy booths. My kind of place.  And while Copycat Co. specializes in dumplings and skewers, Astoria leans to the Sichuan province. Founder Devin Gong even flew to Chengdu to learn the art of Sichuan cuisine, particularly Sichuan peppercorns. Gong even found a vendor in Sichuan who ships chiles to the restaurant. His research shows in the cooking; whereas many wannabe Sichuan restaurants overheat every dish with limited thoughtfulness, Astoria's Sichuan dishes have depth and balance of flavors especially with regards to that mala (\u9ebb\u8fa3) flavor.  All food and cocktail items are $14, and the food is served family-style. We tried the dan dan noodles, chili wontons, la-zi chicken, and mapo tofu - all Sichuan favorites of mine. Tip: stir the dan dan noodles so they're evenly coated in the chili oil. Everything was delicious and exceeded my expectations. The la-zi chicken surprised me. Typically, this dish is composed of boneless chicken amid millions of dried Sichuan chili peppers. Astoria adapted this traditional dish with fried chicken wings braised with leeks in a chili, ginger, garlic sauce. It's creative and delectable.  The cocktails here are wonderful. From the bourbon smashers, Caipirinha, Moscow mules, old fashioned, daiquiris, gimlets, and painkillers, there is a vast array of cocktails to order. I particularly enjoyed Ducky Ros\u00e9, which is made with lemon, St. Germaine, p\u00eache, and Lillet ros\u00e9. It's a lovely summer cocktail.  It's first-come, first-serve. Not a great spot for large groups (they can comfortably seat groups of six or fewer). The bar is open until 2am Sunday through Thursday and until 3am Friday-Saturday.",

We could get similar quality food at an authentic Chinese restaurant but get a portion size 2 or 3 times larger than what we received.  I am perplexed why they thought a small food dish and an alcoholic beverage should be priced the same.  Everything on their menu (all food and all drinks) is priced at $14.  I don't know if it is because we don't drink but our server gave us an attitude.  When we were done with the meal, she was so quick to get us out the door that she nearly dropped a dish on me.  I have quick reflexes so I caught it before it spilled all over me.  She grunted a quick and  insincere apology and left our table.

The Mapo Doufu was very weird, and It felt as if some ingredients were missing from the dish. I also dont understand why everything, including most of the drinks were all priced at 14$, because I think it causes a lot of misunderstanding. The owner told me that this pricing was to make everything easier, but it caused a lot of confusion in the group I was with. I also accidentally double tipped, but that was my mistake due to writing down the tip amount, before leaving it in cash.  Overall, the servers were great, but I really regret coming here otherwise.",

I highly suggest getting in early and getting one of the ends of the bar as it sort of acts as a sort of Chef's table. There is a table next to the kitchen to accommodate a larger group (call ahead).  At the bar you will find a very peculiar drink menu with some tiki oriented offerings and traditional craft oriented drinks on the other side. A Lieutenant Colonel is a great aged rum and spices concoction. The Cerulean city came across as a lighter and more fruity offering, while the Pikachu #2 was creamy with a dusting of cinnamon and a touch of coffee added. Eli was a real craftsman behind the bar cracking ice for each drink and prepared with all the right ingredients and knowledge.  The food offerings were a delight. The dumplings were the star of the show ladled with a great spicy oil-type dressing. The Mapotofu was excellent with a reach, deep sauce with notes of beef, five spice, and peppercorns. Beware your spice levels if you do not like heat.  All in all, a great mix of dishes and drinks without a fork to be found in sight. Highly recommended not just if you are \"in the area.  Add on: just look at the new pictures",

Because of this, it's about time Copy Cat opened a sister location in a different part of town to spread the love.  Astoria DC is in Dupont Circle close to a great burger joint (Duke's Grocery) and a froyo spot (Mr. Yogato). The space itself is small, but they make good use of the space. The royal blue booths and seats make it appear very fancy, but don't be fooled. It's a casual spot for all people and the sweatpants our bartender wore proves it. It's accessible!  Everything on the menu from cocktails to dishes are $14 to make it easy. The bartenders have a list of cocktails ready to go, but I recommend doing bartender's choice. Every time I didn't regret it. I was made a Hawaii cocktail as well as a strawberry caipirinha. They have stiff options and sweet options.  The food is amazing! It's Chinese street food using simple ingredients with bold flavors. Every dish we got was out of this world, but here are they are in order of favorite to least favorite: 1) Chili wonton- it's spicy, but not too spicy, 2) Dan Dan noodles- the best in the city with a good crunch to it (sorry, Panda Gourmet), 3) water boiled beef- it's unique and VERY spicy, but made from stuff awards are given out for, and 4) pork fried rice- tasty, but not as bold as the other dishes.  Astoria will be my new go-to for date night and bro nights. It's perfect!",
