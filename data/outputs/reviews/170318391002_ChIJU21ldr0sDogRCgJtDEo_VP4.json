It was closed twice for vacation for weeks at a time then there's the issue with it's business hours.  We went there at about 530 and the place was pretty empty. It's a nice and clean enough spot to sit down and eat if you wanted.  We did.  The food:  Fried Lobster - it was about what I expected. Its pretty good. It was my 2nd time trying it ever and this time was better.  The Catfish - 1st and foremost it's real catfish. You have to be careful about some of these places passing off Swai as catfish... places that sell real catfish take pride in it (as they did). Cooked just the way I like it and there's not too much breading.  The Okra - it's ok. There's not too much breading but there's still a lot.  Fries - lightly bread fries with seasoning... their ok  Sauces: Bbq (ok) Hot (colored Louisiana)  cocktail sauce... its cocktail sauce  There it is! Hopefully this helps",

Fast forward four or five months later, I decide to try them again for lunch. I ordered online and when I arrived, there was a long line, which I anticipated because it was lunchtime on a Friday. There were at least 5 people ahead of me and, as i listed to what was going on, a customer commented that she was being charged almost $8.00 sales tax. The manager heard the commotion and made a comment to the cashier and she in turn rolled her eyes. Her attitude was bad, very dry and unfriendly. Then, a customer walked in, bypassed the line and went to the counter to be serviced, which she was. When we made a comment, we were ignored by the staff. The customer commented that she ordered online, which we responded, we did too. She should've been asked to wait in line like the rest of us rather than being serviced. The customer ahead of me was so disgusted that she asked for her money back which he stated that he couldn't give her a refund and that she'd have to request it online. When I finally did get my food, it was only ok. Certainly not something worth that kind of experience for. I had the two piece perch and 10 shrimp. It seemed to lack flavor/ seasoning. I was also disappointed that to order anything but fries would cost extra. There's only a handful of meals that come with a side burger than fries included. Also, sauces that I'd normally get for free at similar restaurants (i.e. mild sauce and shrimp cocktail) they charged for. Overall 2 stars for the poor service, long wait and mediocre food. This was my first and last visit there.",

        "caption": "Was looking for an alternative to McD's fish fillet for Friday's (Lent) lunch and saw reviews for this place.  Decided to head over for Fried Lobster and/or the fish sandwich.  First, let me say I am not a big fish eater - eat my share during Lent and then it's back to some meat! I did actually end up ordering both the fish sandwich ($5) and at the last minute figured what the hell, get the fired lobster ($12.50 1/2lb) since it's \"Famous\".  My other judgement was between a tilapia fish sandwich or Coco's Famous fish sandwich.  \"Famous\" won out - I mean for it to famous it has to be good right (it'd be infamous otherwise)?  Also it was cheaper and I am a bit on the cheap side when it comes to eating downtown since taxes are so high.  The fish sandwich came with fries (more like potato wedges) which I liked a lot.  The sandwich itself is served on bread/bun (much like a beef sandwich only dry of course) with lettuce and tomato.  The tartar sauce is in a separate container and I did like this sauce which I'm guessing is homemade with some pepper added to give it a small kick.  My only problem is, as I mentioned, I am not a big fish eater so the famous fish was a bit too fishy tasting for me.  Moving on the the fried lobster, which was king of my lunch for today!  Very good, but perhaps everything that's battered and fried is?  They give you a small container of hot sauce and a regular container of cocktail sauce.  Both were good with the lobster.  Again, it came with fries.  I was already nearing \"full\" after the sandwich and fries so I was close to \"belt busting\" when I was eating the 1/2lb serving.  I'm taking some home for the wife to try - she's a real seafood eater so maybe I should have taken the fish sandwich home and let her judge that :)  I will say you probably are better off phoning in your order.  I got there a little after Noon, decided what to get and placed an order at around 12:11 (now why did I let those two ladies ahead of me?).  My order was ready about 30 minutes later.  They make your meal as you order it, so depending on what you get you may have a wait.  There are some tables along the wall and smaller ones up front so you can sit while waiting, but I was hungry and the smell of all that food was torture for about 30 minutes or so!",
