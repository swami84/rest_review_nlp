As I order mostly rolls, this means sometimes too much rice and other times the rice doesn't even cover the seaweed. Then, the fish is very little. Not even a sliver, and the veggies almost non-existent. The placing in the tray with skimpy sushi allows movement and so my sushi often loses form. And, today the soy sauce was bad. Goodbye Ninja sushi! You just lost a long-time, loyal, and free spending customer. There are too many other places to be bothered and disappointed with you.",

Just as the business business has replied that they are not opened, I am no longer living New York. With such a detailed review, you'd expect the \"owner\" to exercise common sense that this interaction did not happen post-covid,?? Just a thought.  Original review from 01/10/2020:  Horrible customer service. They dont take reservations on \"weekends.\" Friday night is also a weekend, so you've been warned. I called the day before and was told to call again  1hr before my reservation. I called 1hr before my reservation and was told they do not take reservations at this time because the time I am booking will have customers walk in, so come in a bit before the time you want to reserve to book the tables (we are planning for a party of 10). I went in 45mins before the time I want to book and the staff had an internal discussion, in Mandarin, saying that my party is too large and other tables will be gone for new customers if we book it, also mentioned that my party is more than 15 people, which is not.  I spoke to them in English, so maybe they thought I didnt understand Chinese. Well, I do understand them and I also understand that this place is not very accommodating.",

And they didn't load the sushi pieces with a lot of rice which I appreciated. We went for lunch and it was only $14 before tax and tip which I think is a great price considering what you get.

We came because the takeout menu and pictures online looked like this place would be reallly good.  But, we were very disappointed by the service and quality.   We ordered and it took over 30 minutes for anything to come out even miso soup.  This was consistent across the entire restaurant's other patrons.  Also per the pictures that I am posting each piece of sushi came with about a fist full of rice.  If you want any fish with your rice I would suggest you go somewhere else.  The cooked food came out in a pool of grease too.  The only reason they are getting a 2 is because the place was clean.",

A lot of variety of carbohydrates and filling to choose from: udon, soba, fried rice, stir fry. Teriyaki is highly recommended. Teriyaki tofu, shrimp, salmon and chicken are soo flavorful and saucy. Comes with a balance of vegetables to pair off. Sushi: a huge selections of sushi, rolls and hand rolls to choose from but they do NOT offer sashimi. The AYCE fill in paper comes with a menu with description and picture. Two restroom located in the back of the store. Super clean and space. Lunch menu $13.95 Dinner menu $19.95 I would suggest requesting for a dinner menu during lunch hours. Lunch hours consist of less people than dinner, reducing your wait time by half. As well as the speed of receiving your food. The lunch menu is half of what they offer on the dinner menu.",

With that said it doesnt mean that they're very good to begin with. -  The sushi rolls and sushi a la carte were decent. Keep in mind, the prices of everything wasnt too bad. Their menu items are more costly, with each roll costing an average of $3 to $9. The all you can eat lunch and dinner prices($13.95 and $19.95 respectively) is a nice value. - The stir fry noodles didnt seem to be seasoned, but it's still edible and can fill you up if you eat enough of it. TL;DR it's alright sushi if youre looking for a nice meal. I won't deny that I wasn't full after eating, but this isn't authentic and unlike many of the reviews, it didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped.",

Only thing, if you order the steak from the hibachi menu, know that it's like a chewy flat iron steak, not tender at all. The pork Katsu Bento box meal was a good value but the pork was a bit on the thin side. Grilled squid and soft shell crab were worth ordering.",

At first I thought it was a firefly but then closer looking at it, it was a COCKROACH that drowned in the soy sauce and it had been marinating in there.  Told the waitress about the situation, she told the manager.  The manager never expressed his apologies to us or any sorries, he just offered us spicy mayo and left.  You would think something more would have been done but nope. Never coming back to this disgusting place!",

Once I entered, I noticed how clean and well-lit this place was.  This is in contrast to a neighborhood full of restaurants that are on the dirty and unattractive side.  The walls, decor, and furniture were all very stylish and worked together well.  I ordered the vegetable teriyaki dish.  It came with a salad that had a delicious ginger-carrot dressing on it.  We had age tofu as an appetizer.  It's crunchy outer-shell combined with a soft tofu inside was an interesting flavor contrast.  The vegetable teriyaki had a light delicious sauce and was a nice-sized portion.  I was very impressed with the owner who personally came to my table to apologize that they overcooked my dish without my knowledge and asked me to please be patient while they cook a new order for me.  Now that's service!  My wife's sushi order came beautifully presented decorated with a little tree.  She enjoyed her dish.  Our meal was capped off with an offering of watermelon slices which was yet another detail that made this place stand out among other sushi establishments.  We ordered green tea ice cream for dessert.  It was presented with a dallop of whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup.  It was very tasty without being too sweet.  The workers in this restaurant were very pleasant.  Overall, this place was a great experience for my family.",
