We got rice pudding to finish it off and can\u2019t wait to come back for more! Go here now.",

Place was super clean and everything was done right on keeping people socially distant. Ordered a steak tip sub, super tender and very flavorful. Cheese pizza had just the right amount of cheese and great amount of sauce. Also got the lamb and beef shawarma .. YUM!  There is such a variety of food to choose from on the menu. Will definitely be coming back.  Thanks Himalayan kitchen!",

I'm not familiar with authentic Nepalese, but i've had many items from the menu here, and the Chicken Tikka Masala is my go to. Never had an issue with the quantity or the quality if you havn't put that together thus far in my review. Its accurately expensive for the Boston area, but underpriced for bougie Somerville. I wont deny the eat in area isn't ideal. Thats why( I hate to do it but..)I have to take a star away. Its very tight and I feel like i'm sitting at the table next to me with strangers while trying to dine. The table ware also doubles as take out containers. I don't mind because it reduces waste and conserves from using excessive water for clean dishes for everyone. Even for you if you don't stuff your face like a chipmunk as I do. They do in the warmer weather offer outdoor seating which is nice. I usually do pick up thought. The service from the man at the register is always on point. He remembers people(not just customers) so well! Greets most by name with a great big smile. Super friendly and great for front of house. The place is always clean when I visit or being cleaned up after a customer leaves. If you do have any kind of complaint or are unsatisfied in any way, I'm sure if you go in and comment about it the next time you visit, they will rectify the situation. This guy seems to genuinely care about the business. I know that because actions speak louder than words. I frequented this pace before Covid shut down the Nation. HK is my among my favorite places in Somerville and I will continue to go there until I move away. Also offers a discount for cash payment",

Reasonably priced for takeout (and a steal for lunch specials when available!). The spices they use are a true standout, and they have so many options that range from healthier (aloo bodi tama) to more indulgent (pizzas), all with great taste and the ability to make as spicy as desired. As a vegetarian my top picks would be the spicy momos, paneer chili, shahi paneer masala, aloo gobi, palak paneer, mustard greens, aloo bodi tama. When I'm in the mood for extra spicy things the chyoila (soya chunks) is surprisingly good, chili cheese naan or paratha is a must. Lassis are a generous size, and sweet lassi is a more subtle alternative to mango. The owners are super sweet. I'm really hoping that this restaurant doesn't become a casualty of the current COVID situation, so please visit/takeout and support them :)",

We got some chili momos, and they were great- the sauce was the perfect amount of spice. For my main dish, I got the chicken tikka masala. The sauce was so delicious, and the rice was really fluffy and flavorful. He even threw in some free bottled waters for us.

Honestly, he may be the best front of house staff I have ever seen.  Impressively, the food succeeds in following up the initial experience with continued greatness. The spicy dumplings managed a balance of crispy and juicy in the presence of sauce. Jay recommended fish with the house curry, which was a combination I hadn't tried before, but the Salmon added an additional dimension to curry which simply isn't present with other meats.  A worthwhile experience for sure and I will be returning.",

The spice doesn't linger for very long but they do have some chili sauce available that's a bit more spicy. I'd definitely recommend getting the spicy Momo's!  We also ordered goat sekuwa which was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, perfectly seasoned. Comes with rice and salad.  Definitely would come again!",

Their MoMo is delicious, their Naan is just freshly baked buttery goodness, and their curries are fantastic. But what makes the Himalayan Kitchen stand out far above any other place I went to during my tenure in Somerville/Cambridge is the atmosphere in their restaurant. This is a family run business, and they certainly made me feel like family every time I ate there. They remembered my name the second time I dined with them, and it was often a bright spot to go to for a graduate student who didn't really know anyone when I first moved there. The owner was always friendly, and it really meant a lot to me while I was there. I wish I could give this place more stars, as I have not been to any other restaurant that came anywhere close to the warmth I experienced here. The food being some of the best I've ever had just makes this place 6/5. I can't imagine someone coming here and regretting it, and it has my full recommendation!",

Also I believe raita ( yoghurt and mint sauce) compliments biryani\u2019s way more than plain yoghurt. Momo: was good but the sauce wasn\u2019t enough.
