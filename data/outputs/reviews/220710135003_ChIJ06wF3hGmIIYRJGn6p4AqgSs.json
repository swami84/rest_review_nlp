This is not just us but 3 other tables have all been waiting for 15 minutes.  The server is awful - basically insulted us for not knowing what the sides were...and then she pointed them out and left...said she would be back...so now it's 20 minutes later and we still haven't ordered...God forbid you ask a question about the menu here.  The food is not bad in anyway - however my order was wrong...why Lord. So I got home fries and not grits I ordered, also the fried shrimp were left off my order...everything tasted fine, it was just wrong. I can only think that's the servers fault and not the kitchens...I'm guessing it was put in wrong.  In summary, keep walking there are better places.",

We weren't greeted upon arrival and even though there is a sign that says wait to be seated no one came to seat us and the server told up just to be seated anywhere. When we sat down there was no menus on the table except the drink menu. I knew the waitress would be over with the other menu, so I grabbed the drink menu to decide what I wanted to drink. The waitress came back over with the food menus and promptly took the drink menu out of my hand before I could look at it and place it on the opposite side of me. It was extremely rude. I did not say anything because the woman was older. She walked away without another word. I was in disbelief, but I am willing to give any place a second chance. A different waitress came over to the table 2-3 minutes later. She had 1 cup of water (there was 2 of us at the table) and did not greet us. Instead she loudly asked if we wanted anything besides water. We said no and began ordering our food. I had to repeat my order at least three times for the waitress. She did not write anything down just memorized our order which is probably why she had to ask so many times. The food was very basic. Nothing spectacular. Not at all worth what we paid.",

It took a while to get seated but I didn't mind that. What I did mind was that it took nearly 20 minutes for anyone to even come to the table, and even then it was only to get us waters. The waitress was very rude when she came to take our orders nearly 45 minutes after we sat down. She basically came to the table and grunted \"What do you want?\" And that was the total extent of her service. Our food came after another half hour. They forgot my friend's side order of eggs. By the time we had finished our meal we had been at the restaurant for nearly an hour and a half. It took another 15 minutes just to spot our waitress and we had to flag her down to get us the check, which took another 15 minutes. At this point I had decided we weren't going to be leaving a nice tip. We get the check and they had added a 10% automatic gratuity! Most restaurants only do that for parties of 6 or more; this restaurant apparently does for parties of 4, and they didn't have this policy anywhere on the menu. We decided not to argue because at the going rate it would probably take another 30 minutes to get the charge removed, which wasn't worth our time. We paid and left having spent over 2 and a half hours at this restaurant.  Waste of time. Horrible service. Will charge you an automatic gratuity they do not deserve. Do not recommend.",

I ordered the chicken and biscuits. Plating was excellent and the chicken tasted delicious. My only critique would be to add more gravy! My fianc\u00e9 ordered the gumbo and it was his favorite gumbo he tried out of all the the New Orleans restaurants. If you are in New Orleans you HAVE TO TRY Old Coffee Pot.

This was terrible in every single way and has vermin!  -The wait took forever and there was hardly anyone there. One server who appeared to be under the influence spent most of her time outside on the sidewalk smoking cigarettes.  -The servers are older, and thus a bit slow, confused and forgetful.  -The food is mediocre at its very best.  Four of us for breakfast took nearly two hours. Our server took our order, dropped it off, got it wrong, and never came back. We went ahead and ate it anyway because we couldn\u2019t seem to find her anywhere. No coffee refills. We waited an additional hour for our check and only got it because we finally went inside to track someone down for it. We were going to just get up and walk away without paying. Incidentally, a man came in while we were there. He sat down and was given a menu. In 25 minutes no one ever came back to take his order. He got up to leave, made a comment to a server on his way out the door telling them they were \u201crude\u201d, and she couldn\u2019t for the life of her figure out why he was upset. I hollered over \u201cits because you never took his order; he sat there with a menu for 25 minutes\u201d and she just shrugged.  We warned people as we left the building not to bother. A group of guys standing there in the rain nearly 30 minutes insisted on going in just because the place had been featured on TV. However, we succeeded in getting another group of people who had been standing in line for a long time to go somewhere else. A haggard, bedraggled waitress from the establishment who looked like she was under the influence and had a cigarette hanging out of her mouth looked at me really funny and before she could ask me why I suggested the other patrons leave, I stopped her and told her what a horrible experience we had.  Just don\u2019t do it. Mediocre food. High prices. Vermin. The worst service I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life at a restaurant. Who gives a care if the place was visited by Gordon Ramsay because they were having problems? Or because it was featured on television? It\u2019s New Orleans! Half the restaurants here are featured on TV and have famous chefs visit them. The Board of Health should shut this place down. Unacceptable!",

Part 3: We went here because it was on the \"Gordon Ramsay 24hrs show: and I have to say they kept the decor and is way better! DO NOT ever change. I did notice that the Bar top was cluttered and being used as a serve station instead of a bar (honest review), needs to be cleared off again.  Owner: Need to advertise more, take the fact you were on the show and get some signs out and promote more in the neighborhood :). Get more out of what you age enjoying.

You were supposed to wait to be seated.\", and then reluctantly sat us. We then patiently waited for 15 minutes, and not one person checked in on us. Two parties that arrived at least five minutes after us had their order taken before us. Needless to say, I did not spend a dime in there. We got up and left before anyone ever checked in on us.

Did you know people have to put chicken wire on the backs of their stoves and ovens to keep rodents out? Or maybe you've had termites or pine roaches, I'm sure you know someone who has.  Did you burn your house or car to the ground?  Did you never use it again?  Hell no.  Yes the toaster was bad, believe that it's gone.  Get a grip, no business is going to be 100% every day of the year.  The whole point is any place could be like that, you don't know, so respect the honesty and integrity that the owner agreed to do this bearinag his faults and fix them.  I have eaten all over the country and will enjoy this place next time the fam hits New Orleans, only a couple hours for us.  I am astounded that the owner didn't walk away, more power to you man, I feel for you I would have shut down too, easy.  I hope you and your kiddos are thriving and you have a fresh start on life.  Yelp bloggers and self named \"food critics\" are bullsh$t and ruining decent places to get off on a power trip and to make their hollow lives feel important.  Put your damn phone down, give any one a second shot or just don't go back. I'm ashamed to be called a millennial with how we treat others and others lives with technology.  The world doesn't owe us anything and no one needs to know everything you think or fart out of your brain.",

Honestly I dunno but I felt very uncomfortable there. Also we thought that the portion sizes cor the banana French toast were going to be larger because our friends were going to share it, but it ended up being tiny, and for $10 too. The food was very good, but overpriced. If there was a zero star I might five it that. Please respond to this review if you care about your customers and making the restaurant a better place.",

I'm not disappointed at all that we did. Certainly a place with a lot of history, the building has a simply perfect outside seating area which thankfully had a near continuous gentle breeze helping to keep the heat of the late morning from ruining our experience. The food was very good in a comfort food sort of way. Scrambled eggs were a little dry, but the poached eggs were perfectly done. Our server was a little rough at first, but once she got a cup of coffee, or 3, in her she warmed right up and was extremely pleasant. As for the best place in the French Quarter, I personally put it second.",

My son was so curious to see the place after just watching it on TV.  He wanted to make sure the mouse was removed from the toaster and the kitchen.  Kids!  Anyway, we didn't eat there.  I had a cocktail and my son had a Sprite only.  We were only there to see the rennovations and if they were still in business.  We had a delightful conversation with Chris the new bartenter and a cook and snapped a few pictures of the decor.  Chris was humble, frank, professional and very sociable as a good bartender should be.    The cook was also very polite and friendly and answered all.my son's questions.  We enjoyed our short visit there drinking our refreshments and chatting with Chris.  I cannot speak for the food because we had eaten before our visit.  In my opinion, definitely more rennovations could have been made but due to the time constraints of the location and the production department of Hell's Kitchen I gathered they couldn't do more in the short span of time allocated. Shame.  We didn't see any women staff there thank God because on TV show they seemed to be a big source of the problem.  I hope the owner will finally make a decision to either be all in or out because whatever was going on is still lingering in the air.  It seems like a cool spot to duck in for a while when out and about and it sits direct next door to Pat O'Brian's. Within an hour of leaving my son complained his tummy hurt and we had to stop twice for him to potty and a couple hours later I was in the restroom for a while.  Hmm, maybe the ice cubes.  I didn't expect that.  I wanted to give it at least a 4-star until we both had tummy issues right after leaving.  But it has a lovely alley outside dining/drinking area, is decorated cute and bright and Chris the bartender wasn't there when the show aired but was the best part of our experience.  Thanks again to Chris and the cook.",

No I\u2019ve never been to this restaurant and what I see here are lying about the rats unless they have picture, you know seeing is proof it seems like they have seen them rats on tv when Gordon Ramsay went there and helped him out, the owner doesnt deserve anyone\u2019s lies!!! As for rude waitresses maybe they need a vacation, but hey we all have bad days and none of us our perfect, maybe Gordon will show up again and help them out! It was really nice seeing Gordon Ramsay on the show where he helped them out and I hope in my life time I get to come to this restaurant....and meet the owner also...Geez now I\u2019ve read more reviews and I can\u2019t believe the people on here and how \u201crude\u201d some of them are about the mice, the MICE are gone!",

When we received our check, they did not discount any bill.  I ordered dessert, and the waitress brought out the incorrect one. She let us keep it as she went to get the right one, but then charged us for it at the end. They also put a 20% gratuity on our check, which is fine, except when I gave $80 for a $63 bill, I received no change. Our friend paid $100 on an $81 bill and also received no change. When we brought it up, we had to remind her how much change we needed. After our experience that night, we felt like she was trying to take our change as an extra tip.  The drinks were good, and the food was....meh. some dishes were great, others were not. I would never recommend this place on their business practices alone.",

Toasted English muffins topped with cream spinach, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce were delicious! They come with a side of either potatoes or grits. My mom had the corn and crawfish chowder which was also quite tasty although a bit salty. While the food was delicious, the service was among the worst I have experienced in several years. There were 2 servers working who were slow, inefficient, unorganized, and unapologetic. It took about 15 minutes before we were greeted at the door and offered a table. After sitting down, it was another 15 to 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence at a table. During this time, I watched several tables get up and leave from not being acknowledged and a server get a drink order, make drinks, bring the drinks to the table, and get a food order from a single table while not acknowledging any of the other guests who were waiting at tables nearby.  I have worked as a server, and I know the key to being a good server is being able to multitask, apologize, and be friendly. Unfortunately, these servers missed the first 2 by far. The male server changed his hair several times while we ate. It is amazing to me that he had time to put his hair into a ponytail and then take it back down multiple times yet there were tables who were waiting for service.",

Waitstaff (two) seemed overwhelmed (although they were both very courteous and were working very hard). Our food sat for awhile before our waiter had a chance to go get it and bring and, as a result, cooled a bit.  If I could break down the stars, I\u2019d give 5 for the taste of the food, 5 for the hard-working waitstaff and 1 for the owner/Manager for not having more staff during breakfast.",

It took us 20 minutes to be seated when the restaurant was basically empty, another half hour before we were even asked if we wanted something to drink, and as I'm writing this we're going on 20 minutes since the waitress said she'd bring us the check. That's just the wait time, though. The waitress bit off all three of my friends' heads more than once throughout our dining experience and she just narrowly missed spilling hot coffee all over my girlfriend. There are countless other restaurants in New Orleans, so I recommend choosing a different one.",

More of a tourist haunt, because you would not want to keep coming back. Update. As we finish our meal I am downgrading the service to poor. Too many mistakes, too grumpy.",
