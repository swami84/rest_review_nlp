I don\u2019t eat shrimp and they usually have no problem substituting salmon when I request it with my orders. Have done so manyyyyyy times dining or ordering delivery. However, today the young lady I spoke with gave me a bit of a hard time and seemed confused my request.  First she told me I would have to cancel my order, order a salmon entree dish and note that I wanted a salad... WHAT? By the time she told me that their restaurant was closed in the app so that wasn\u2019t even possible. I told her I have no problem paying an additional charge even though they\u2019ve never asked me to pay more before. It wasn\u2019t an issue until she told me I would have to pay an extra $10 for salmon to be added to the salad I ordered... $10 on top of the additional $8 I already paid to add on a protein to my meal. I asked several times just to make sure she was really trying to charge me a total of $29 for a salmon Cesar salad and she was! Absolutely ridiculous.  They\u2019ve definitely lost a loyal customer. Honestly, I\u2019m so turned off by the whole exchange that I\u2019d never order or dine there again.",

So after I wrote this review I got a text from my credit card account and restaurant fixed the extra charge that the waiter charged me so is alway's a good thing to write a review because you can get this issues fixed I alway's do this and get results thank you very much for fixing this for me I appreciate that.",

We brought this to the managers attention and all he did was give us 2 cans of soda which basically they over charged me ended up paying more taxes and a whopping 18% tip they add themselves at the end of the bill which i dont mind paying if the service is worth it.

Upon arrival felt welcomed and served. The waiter was asked several to leave the drink menu and he didn't. When we wnted traditional drinks our server was no where to be found -waiting,waiting waiting for service had hand up no one else came. Serve returned after approximately 35 minutes by then our appetite was severed. The traditional HAPPY birthday celebration was omitted for my daughter while they continue to do it for the other tables. My daughter felt snubbed by this behavior and asked to leave. The server was only preoccupied with our paying the handsome bill before he left for his shilf. The meals were exquisite but the customer service was horrible. I was hoping to go back but I don't recommend it and will not go back. \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude23",

But the main thing was the service, we had to constantly remind our server for our drinks, the water, simple things. The gentleman that came in and helped towards the end was good, but the original lady we had could use more training.",

Service was just horrible and it wasn\u2019t busy at all so I really didn\u2019t understand . Our server never brought us menus we had to ask for them ! Our server had very little knowledge of the food and drink menus  was not able to give us any feedback or answer our question .. we order a round of drinks 2 wines a beer and a cocktail . Our apps came out before our drinks . When trying to ask questions about the menu or suggestions out server had no idea how to answer . Overall the food was good except the shrimp mac & cheese . Make sure to taste the fish ceviche and crab meat pastelitos super delish . ! When it came to the dessert we had the tres leches which was really good  but the server only brought out 2 spoons it was five of us in the table , Overall I don\u2019t think if I\u2019m going to be coming back I had really had hopes but I left really disappointed .",

The service was not the best but it wasn't bad either so I tipped the server $20.

I watched a number of customers order a bottle of Stella and pay cash, $10, unaware that this already includes the tip then be encouraged to utilize the large tip jar sitting on the counter. There\u2019s no indication anywhere in the restaurant that this is the practice, just on the website. Just seems like a deceptive business practice.",

At arrival we were greeted very courteously by the hostess who guide us to a very comfortable table with a booth which made my Wyfe and daughter happy. the server Ralph was prompt and very professional even though they where very busy that day, he was calm and attentive to details like offering minerals water before the wine list I happened to like a nice cold butler of sparkling water on my table. He then took our drink order on a very timely manner including a nice bottle of pinogrillo he offer us some appetizers like fried calamari  and clams casino These are the best clams I Had ever so flavorful they are a must have when you come here, we weren\u2019t ready to order our food yet so he when on to his other tables . Ralph Soon came back, we ask some questions about some of the great dishes that are in the menu he was very knowledgeable and we where all very happy with his recommendations. My son in-law ha d a  skirt stake which was beautifully decorated and properly cooked medium  and very juicy I felt in love with my trifongo that is made with green plantains Maduros and Yuca served with churasco on the side my Wyfe had the grilled salmon that was so good tender juicy and substantial that we all tasted it. My daughter had the Brest of stuffed chicken which she enjoyed very much . I love the the Freshness specially of the seafood because of the fact that the Restaurant also has its own sea food market in the same premises. The dining room is spacious very modern and beautifully decorated it is a great place to visit I have being in the restaurant business for more than thirty five years and I highly recommend Casa Del Mar",

First, the busboy in a suit, what a rude individual. If you are going to take something out of a table, please ask for permission or acknowledgement,  you don't just snatck it out of the table, then it seems that one has  to self serve for water and beg for the food that after you ordered they forget to bring it to you, because for them to serve it seems too much of a burden. Now the food, Casa del Mar, the name imply its specialty is seafood, for Christ sake, they even have a fish market onsite, so one would expect real seafood. Ohhh no, the Salmon filet is a BJ's pre-pack Salmon just super pricey. What a disappointment this place was and I hope this was just a flu and if they have management for them to improve. Otherwise, you are better off at Marisco Central right across the bridge in Manhattan.",
