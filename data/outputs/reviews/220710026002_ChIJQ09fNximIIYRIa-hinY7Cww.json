Don't be fooled by the well worn stairs, their kitchen delivers amazingly delicious options. The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly, surrounded by a delicious sauce of butter, garlic & spices. The lamb flavor was there and it definitely wasn't too gamey. Their veal dishes are amazingly tender and the preparations range from simple picatta, to spinach & lemon sauce or their intoxicating Ocean Sauce (shrimp & crawfish in a light, creamy sauce). We were all pleasantly fill but couldn't leave before sharing a slice of delightfully refreshing lemon cello cake.",

Because I have not lived near the gulf coast since graduating from LSU, I CRAVE fresh seafood (I have tasted all the other non-seafood dishes and they are great).    I go to Adolfo's every time I return home and am never disappointed.   If you don't like their fresh fish with Ocean Sauce, you are from too far away.  :)   I found this place bc my fishing guide about 10 years ago put me onto it before Adolfo's became a staple.    He knew the chef (at that time it was Gotto) and actually sold fresh fish to him that would be served the night it was caught.   Many great restaurants in my home town.  This is one of them for sure.",

Told us about the \u201cspecials\u201d lamb and flounder, did not mention price and we didn\u2019t ask. We ordered the specials, which is a big up sell to say the least which we didn\u2019t find out til we got the bill.  The food was very good, except the pasta start was noodles with a watery tomato sauce, quite flavorless. Cash only place, took out extra money before the meal. Got the bill it was just under $200 before tax. The lamb was 39 a plate! Gave the waiter a $25 tip. He returned it to us and made it known to us he expected a $50 tip! Wow the arrogance. His service was ok, but here\u2019s the thing, it doesn\u2019t take any more expertise to set down a plate that cost $40 as it does to set down a plate that costs $17.  And who deserves an extra $50 for less than an hours service?! The blues and Jazz bands that play in the bars work a whole lot harder for their tips and get way less per hour. They are skilled musicians. Healthcare workers sure don\u2019t get tipped an extra $50 per hour by all their patients for the care they receive. The absolute arrogance of this waiter and reading other reviews this is common place at this establishment. I will never go back. With all the amazing food choices in New Orleans that give great service with no attitude, it\u2019s a no brainer.",

        "caption": "Word of mouth can be a powerful marketing play.  When NOLA locals said some of the best New Orleans food can be found in this quaint house just outside the quarter; I was all in.  Well at least half that story is accurate, it is in a quaint house outside the quarter.  Here is case where the hype does not live up.  Let me tell you why.  My meal order included the mussels, wine and the lamb.  Pasta comes with the meal.  The mussels were a highlight and wonderfully  plump and flavorful.  The pasta was nothing more than some overcooked noodles with a splash of tomato sauce and some cheese.  Very basic and void of discernible flavor.   The lamb arrived in a pool of juice with rosemary swimming around.  The lamb was meaty and the rosemary added to meat, but it was not anything I would rave about.  The meal was not the least bit refined nor fine dining.  The server receives an award for up selling which he did with great enthusiasm.   All his recommendations were some of the most expensive items available and my meal alone cost $70 with only one glass of wine.  A coincidence?  I am not sure, but our table fell for it and ironically, this quaint Italian restaurant became my most expensive meal in New Orleans, but certainly not one of the better meals.  I feel a tinge of the overused word tourist trap, but I guess you can decide.",

We came across a nondescript place with a small unlit sign called Adolfo's Restaurant. It\u2019s above a bar and has only 10 tables. As soon as we walked in the door we knew it was the place for us. Small, intimate, and lots of character. Our waiter, James, was at the top of his game, and knew the menu inside and out. We opted to start with Mussels, and then moved on to one of the specials, which was a New York Strip, medium rare of course, topped with their Ocean Sauce. The Ocean Sauce has a light cream base with half of each, crabmeat, crawfish, shrimp, and capers. It was outstanding, as was the wine pairing and Limoncello cake for dessert. If you are headed to New Orleans, check out Adolfo\u2019s, and definitely ask for James! It\u2019s an evening we won\u2019t soon forget! Highly recommend!",

The ocean sauce was okay at best, though it was cold. The steak was a \"ny strip\" but was not tender at all and I ordered it rare. The ocean sauce was an additional $10 which was not communicated. We also ordered the lamb and it was so unbelievably tender. The sauce was good but very salty. The pasta was nothing to write home about. Bland tomatoe sauce, normal linguine. The eggplant parmesan was mediocre, soggy. The crab and corn cannoli was delicious and the sauce with it was beyond amazing. For the reputation of this it honestly was a let down. The wine is cheap though so that's a plus.",

I started by ordering some kind of pasta but the waitress said it wasn't their specialty (Why it's on the menu, other than wasting my time, beats me). Ah well, alas i tried their fish with \"Oceansauce\" (I wonder what Ocean have inspired that name?! Is it next to the Dead Sea?) Looked alright, took a bite - Mind you, i enjoy pepper, pepper is good on almost everything. But in moderation, the most peppery dish i make is Carbonara which use a bit more pepper than average. By Odins beard, this \"Oceansauce\" was abusing the power and might of the pepper. If this is one of their Specialties i'm glad i didn't get the pasta.. okay, when asking the waitress about the quantity of pepper in it,  she kindly remarked that it was a creole / Cajun, magical  excuse to over-season it. Hmm, maybe a one off on account of all these other excellent reviews. But next time, i'm getting a Hotdog or a  Po' Boy",

After all there was still time to fail at quality control and get the bill wrong before this experience was finally over.

We ended up paying $20 extra to have one meal split onto two plates; and only found out it cost us that much when the bill arrived. When we asked about it, we were shown a piece of paper that said: \u201csharing is discouraged\u201d - that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s mandatory to order a plate per person or CHARGE $20 to split a plate if you don\u2019t. And the food was pretty okay - however, it was not worth the $50 we paid for it!",

I\u2019m not sure where all the good reviews come from. If we would have been able to preview a menu online, we probably would have decided not to go.  This part of town was the sketchiest part of New Orleans we visited it. As the concierge at our hotel stated, \u201conly enter Frenchman St through Decatur as the other areas around there are \u201cresidential.\u201d I think that was a nice way of saying, DO NOT go anywhere besides Decatur and Frenchman.  We saw the menu after being seated. We had already ordered an appetizer immediately which the waitress recommended. After reviewing the menu further, we decided we really didn\u2019t want to eat here so we wanted to pay for the app and leave. We weren\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d to. We had to order an entree per person, which made no sense and nowhere did it say that on the menu. So, we were FORCED to pick something off the menu. We didn\u2019t like anything we ordered for our entrees. The pasta my friend got was simply spicy and had no flavor to it. My chicken piccata was fine but nothing special. I can get Italian food at home.  Now, the only reason I give this 2 stars is that a couple sitting close to us had ordered the mussels in garlic sauce (I think it was a special for that day). They had SO MANY mussels. So many they even offered us some. So we tried it, not having mussels before, and it was DELICIOUS. I wish I would have gotten that, but due to their \u201crules,\u201d so much would have been wasted since we wouldn\u2019t be able to split it.  Also, they are a cash only business.... and they sure do try and talk you into buying the most expensive items on the menu.  I paid 25$ for a piece of chicken, since it is only the chicken. You can choose between a salad or side pasta, but it doesn\u2019t come with any sides itself...",

We should have split one appetizer. The main  courses come with side salad or pasta. I chose the fish of of of.the day, grouper, with the Creole seafood sauce with crawfish and shrimp which was delicious and very creany and filling. My wife had the rack of lamb with ten lamb chops which she was very fond of. The pricing was very reasonable and there is a cash only policy. An ATM is on site for your convenience. Our server was charming and attentive. My dad would always say\" you can't go wrong with The New York Strip\" . I will have that on my next visit.",

I wanted a simple pasta or chicken dish but we were talked into getting the stuffed flounder and the rack of lamb. The meals we ordered were presented as specials and didn't have prices listed...we should have asked. Both dishes came with a side of salad  or pasta. Can't comment on the salad but the pasta side was very basic. The lamb costs $38 and the flounder was $24. For the price we paid we expected better quality and taste.",

As an avid fisherman and life-long fan of sea food I have had many excellent meals at many restaurants and at home but this overshadows all! We were lucky enough to have our meal prepared by Adolfo himself and he most certainly didn't disappoint. This was our first trip to New Orleans and this restaurant was suggested by a fellow passenger on our flight who also happened to be a local from the city. The restaurant itself is quite small and seating is very limited but it is truly a fantastic find and if you have the opportunity I highly suggest dining at this establishment!",

The food is to die for and you definitely have to try the ocean sauce! The service was also great and our waiter was very helpful with recommendations.  Cash only restaurant, but if you need more cash there is an ATM in the restaurant. Be prepared for a wait on busy nights, you'll have to wait in the bar downstairs for your name to be called which is also cash only, but the food is definitely worth it. My friend and I ordered the mussels which was fresh and delicious, and split the pork chops with ocean sauce. Both were amazing, especially the pork chop! It was tender and cooked just right, and it was a nice healthy portion. The ocean sauce I would have for every meal if I could and it was basically butter, shrimp, blue crab and deliciousness. Wish we could've tried the rack of lamb and the steak, but we didn't have any room. We did get the tiramisu for dessert, which was nice and fluffy. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the garlic bread, but everything else was top notch. I'd definitely come back here again if I'm ever back in the city!",

Our waitress was really friendly and seemed genuinely enthusiastic about the food.  They had plenty of nice-sounding specials on but I was just really in the mood for a simple pasta while my partner opted for a chicken dish, which he really loved. The food isn\u2019t particularly \u201cwow!\u201d or creative beyond having a slight Creole influence in some of the dishes, it\u2019s more like home cooked comfort food, and the prices are quite cheap and the portions were decent, so we were happy. We each had a glass of the house red, which was okay, and shared a piece of limoncello cake for dessert, which was pretty good.  They only take cash but do have an ATM.  If you want some cheap and tasty comfort food in a romantic setting, this place is a decent bet.",

Delicate and delicious marinara which is light and pasta that is also tender and perfect. Seriously amazing. Reasonably priced ($$) but CASH ONLY, be aware.

We waited for an hour and a half but it was so worth it! We had the steak in ocean sauce and their snapper also in the ocean sauce with an order of escargot as an appetizer. From our meal, the garlic bread, wine, and family feel, we had a great time. Just make sure you bring a wad of cash as it is cash only. You will spend an average of $50 per person so be mindful. They do have an atm available though, so no worries. I will absolutely return to this delicious place.  So worth everything",

I,ordered the lamb, it was cooked perfectly and was tender but lacked flavor.  It seemed like it had some oil and rosemary but no real flavor.  It came with a side of pasta which was noodles and spaghetti sauce and it was horrible.  Sauce was so watery and flavor lacking. We also got the flounder with crab meat and ocean sauce.  Flavor was okay but left more to be desired especially for the price.  We also go the salmon which was liked and a eggplant parmesian which was also awful similar to the other pasta.  Again sauce was very watery and the entire plate lacked flavoring.  We also sat under and AC vent that was covered in mold that kept dripping water on our table.  We told the waitress and she replied with \"well there's nothing we can do about that\".  A bit disapppinting that she didn't offer to move our seat or any other resolution.  I would not go back.",

Calin our waiter was outstanding. Food came out to the first tables a little fast, but but the time we were served our entree\u2019s came out at just the fight time to enjoy out appetizer and salad. We had the mussels for our appetizer and the were excellent in a garlic butter sauce similar to a barbecue shrimp sauce. We then had the stuffed flounder and pork chops for entrees. The portion for the pork chop was about 2 pounds of very succulent and delicious lightly smoked pork covered with their signature ocean sauce. The stuffed flounder was also a large portion and also covered with ocean sauce. I was very impressed with the consistence and flavor of the stuffed flounder because of how evenly the fish and stuffing was cooked throughout. These people have a very high quality food and service and we will definitely be back and recommend to anyone looking for superb food in a casual atmosphere.",
