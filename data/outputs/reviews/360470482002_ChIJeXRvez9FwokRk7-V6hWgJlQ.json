While I was waiting, two women with a child stood in the cold and asked if they had to pay for food.  I was dumbfounded. Restaurants are struggling in COVID times. I responded, \u201cI think you have to pay for food but I\u2019ll ask\u201d.  The woman behind the counter took one look outside and said \u201cI know her.  I\u2019ll take care of her\u201d.  It was such a beautiful random act of kindness to witness.  It became very clear to me that they serve the community regularly and even offer free food deliveries to the elderly.  Swooooooon!  This same woman gave me a free \u201csample\u201d of Spinach Chaat. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s best if you eat it fresh. Sit in your car and I\u2019ll bring your food to you when it\u2019s ready\u201d.  I place \u201csample\u201d in quotation marks because this \u201csample\u201d was the equivalent of a full meal.  Words cannot describe how delicious it was. It\u2019s not something I would have normally ordered on my own and I\u2019m so grateful.  She didn\u2019t know this, but at 8pm, her sample was my first meal of the day.  My full order was completely worth the wait!  Grilled chicken kebabs, grilled lamb chop, chicken kofta, chicken tikka masala, spinach saag, and rice.  Mmmmmm.  The spices and aromas were perfect!  I highly recommend, not only for the quality of their food but for their generosity, friendly demeanor and sense of community.  The staff of Jalsa sure knows how to warm a heart and belly on these cold winters nights!",

They are doing take out due to Covid and it was totally worth it to go there and pick up the amazing food. ------ The most authentic Kolkata food in NYC. This is the only place that makes (Arsalan style) Kolkata biriyani, and yes, they come with potatoes. Also, the chicken chaap is a must try. Get some white rice to go with it. The paneer we got here was fresh home made and super soft. Overall this place was a gastronomical delight. Plus, the prices are low! Strongly recommend!",

The result is simply stunning. It's a small local restaurant with out of this world flavors. The menu is small, and the quality very high. They even make their own paneer, everything is cooked fresh, to your order. This means that you have to be prepared to talk amongst yourselves while you wait for your food. There is nothing fast food here, it takes time to come to the table. And yet, it is well worth your time. I rated Jalsa as the best tasting subcontinent food I have had in North America.",

I also had the Gobi Mirchi Keema curry, which was minced cauliflower curry dish, which was also amazing. Both were fresh and delicious and were new flavors to me. My boyfriend had the ghost chicken which he gobbled up. Our servers were lovely, and taught us about the dishes and what regions they from and gave great recommendations. We learned they are doing a dosa brunch now from 9-3. They have several vegan and gluten free options on both menus.  The menu clearly states that they make everything from scratch and it may take a little time for your food, so plan accordingly. We didn't wait long at all in the restaurant, and were enjoying a night out anyways, but this is clearly not pre-made food that will show up 3 minutes after you order it.  I have not tried delivery, so cannot speak to that, but eating in the restaurant was charming and fun and food was piping hot! Will definitely be going back!",

Jalsa, however, is much different!  First of all it is an Indian restaurant so the emphasis is on the spices. Indian food is much less oily than Pakistani and Bengali food and the flavors are thus more subtle and complex. Also they offer vegetarian and vegan options such as palak chaat, artichoke tiki masala and kale and spinach pagora which have attracted customers coming all the way from Manhattan!  Secondly it is a clean, informal restaurant where friendly service, reasonable prices and comfort are emphasized. The owner is on hand every day to be sure you enjoy your meal and is more than willing to honor special requests.  Third as of 6/23/19 they have added a South Indian brunch that includes amazing dosa and other breakfast foods!  Fourth Jalsa is one of the only places in all of New York City where you can order an authentic Indian chikoo shakes! If you\u2019ve never had one, it\u2019s made from an Indian fruit. It tastes a little like a vanilla milkshake and trust me a chikoo shake is not only healthy but incredibly delicious! (see photo posted below)  Finally the demographics of Parkville, the neighborhood in which Jalsa is located, are changing and as a result, Jalsa meets the need for those new to the area who are looking for a clean, informal and friendly restaurant at which to relax and enjoy some very well made Indian food.",

The very friendly and helpful owner is always there to be sure you order exactly what you want. Her staff is likewise committed to being sure you enjoy your visit!  I learned that they cook their vegan dishes in separate pots to avoid cross contamination with their meat and poultry entrees and that their chef is a vegetarian and a certified Bikrim yoga instructor!

The aggressive toasting of pungent mustard seeds; the char on singed red chile pods; the faint blackening of curry leaves flash-fried to a brittle, translucent crisp. All these smoky subtleties come together in the magnificent Jalsa, a quietly sophisticated spot tucked away in Brooklyn's Coney island\u00a0 neighborhood. Fascinating and complex, the shish kabab was the best\u00a0 dish I had tried in ages. I was similarly impressed on another visit, when a weekend special of housemade lamb seekh kebab came forth from the tandoor as delicate, loose-textured lamb\u00a0 alive with onion and herbs, magenta pickled onion crescents delivering a final kick. The world Jalsa has fashioned on Coney island avebue\u00a0 exudes the calm confidence of there cooking. It's the dining room of a man who knows how to edit and knows his own mind. Jalsa menu and operational rules reflect the same qualities.\u00a0 There are no \"degree of hotness\" options, because Jalsa wants to let each dish express its best self, with its own innate balance. Rice plate is perfect, each grain of basmati distinct, with saffron threads tinting some and tinges of love. above all the waiters and the owners will take your order with love, they have the best patience. I can't wait to try there next dishes and review them.\u00a0 As for the parking part, of you wait a bit there's always someone leaving ( remember; patience has great rewards).",

The restaurant is only 15 minutes from our house, so after the first call when they said it would take 10 minutes to make, there was no reason for it to take another 2 hours to have it arrive. They apologized, but at that point they had already lost a customer. It would have been much simpler for them to have refunded us and maybe we wouldn't have been so annoyed.",

Upon entry, it's a small compact type of space for the restaurant. It has a home type feeling with the entire staff greeting you.  I had the Lamb Tikka Masala and my other half had Shrimp Yogurt Curry. Wait time is usually longer than other similar restaurant which I estimated 25+ mins until my meal arrived.  I must say it was worth the wait. It was extremely delicious with the aroma of home cooking stimulating my senses. The Naan and Yellow Rice Sahri (think it's called) complimented our Curry dishes and we both ate our entire meal.  My other half ordered both dishes as spicy but for me...nothing I came across that's too spicy since I been use to it as a kid. But the extra spiciness caught her off guard LOL  We were greeted by the owner(s) and one of them noticed my other half was breathing fire \ud83d\udd25. Then the next course of action which I took notice and saw a really kind gesture from management.  The guy brought her Rasmali with extra milk to help sooth the spicy food she ate which I find incredibly admirable and sincere. Things like this what makes or break a restaurant and warranted my positive review with great food and sincerity. I am for sure coming back again to try other dishes. Thank you for the warm hospitality!  Bonus Note: Food is Halal \ud83e\udd70",

Bengal is a state in Eastern India that lies adjacent to(and was erstwhile a part of) Bangladesh. The food of this region is dominated by influences of Islamic regimes (biriyani, chaap etc) and an abundance of water resources (malaikari, paturi etc). The food, if you do indeed try the Bengali dishes, should taste reminiscent of a lot of the stereotypical Indian fare, but still distinctly different with sometimes finer flavors, sweeter and more aromatic, and sometimes a culinary gut-punch of wasabi-esque gravy of mustard. Be prepared to be surprised and exhilarated.  We ordered the biriyani(biryani) of course. It is a medley of rice cooked with intense aromas of spices, meat, saffron and the humble potato. The inclusion of the potato along with the finer and sweeter flavor undertones define the biriyani of this region. Having ancient Persian roots, if you want the truest and more pure rendition of the Bengali variant in the entire tri-state area, this place is a must-go.  Amazingly, the stellar biriyani was given a run for it's money during my meal by the chicken chaap. This is an opulent and aromatic chicken gravy made from heavily reduced and perfectly softened pieces of chicken legs. Although a great accompaniment of the biryani, this dish truly shines on its own if you try it with white rice. Do not get apprehensive on seeing the fat and oil that separates in the gravy. Anything that tastes this good deserves an extra gym run.  We also ordered the paneer nizami and naan. To be honest these were supposed to be just fillers to stand as gastronomic back-ups to the meaty encores. As a pleasant surprise, the paneer was the most fresh and tender I have had in a long time. The dish stuffs the paneer with filling and cooks it in a thick creamy gravy. The soft naan made for the perfect foil. Again, perfection!  It is not always that you walk out of a restaurant ruing the wait till you come back again. This was one of those for me and my friends. The food was exquisite. The service was brilliant. The owner is very friendly and chats with customers. All of her recommendations from the menu were hits. She also offered us complementary appetizer chickpeas and taster shots of mango lassi. Oh yes.. the mango lassi. We ended up buying entire glasses each because it was so good with the food.  Now, a message to the restaurant owners, I really appreciate the earnest attempt to reach out to so many people who might not know about these special and amazingly tasty cuisines. I thank you for not compromising on the true tastes and flavors that hallmark the food. Thank you and best of luck.",

        "caption": "Haha, so I'm embarrassed to admit that my fiance and I ate there a week ago. And then came back last night.  My fiance is vegan and I'm a dairy-intolerant vegetarian, and we live nearby. It's really hard to find vegan/veg-friendly south asian cuisine in this area, actually. Most places don't separate the cooking areas of meat vs veg&vegan and avoiding cross-contamination is important to us. Then we heard the news of Jalsa's opening, and Indian restaurant with several options. Finally!! :D  So last week, we dined in and had the vegan plantain kofta, and OMG that sauce is dreamy and the kofta is so on point with the texture!! We also had the vegan bhel puri which to me is the perfect flavor blend of spicy, sweet, tangy, savory, salty, and with a nice crispy texture. :) The biryani is also very nice!!!  Then we came back last night and got the same stuff. Haha. We were craving it hard ever since having some. :D  The restaurant is very new, and they are still underway with fixing it up and redecorating everything. So just keep in mind that they literally just opened. But personally, I like that it's simple inside -- a bare bones place with a focus on getting that flavor right.  And that they do. :)",

We were skeptical that all 5 star reviews were fake but there are still genuine people in the world and these guys are one of them. Definitely try their paneer Tikka. It was out of the world and the best we\u2019ve ever had. But of course all 4 dishes we ordered were amazing. Keep it up, guys! Unfortunately we are from Boston and won\u2019t get to come here everyday. Sigh :(",

I am an international student from India who has only lived a few years in the USA and ever since, I have been craving for Indian food. I tried many Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi restaurants in Manhattan, Brooklyn (in the same neighborhood) And even in New Jersey but it was never the same taste as my home country. The places always lacked flavor and everything was too generic. BUT THIS PLACE WAS AN ANSWER TO MY CRY!!! The FOOD IS EXACTLY HOW INDIAN FOOD SHOULD TASTE LIKE! I tried the Dum Biryani, Butter Chicken and Rice. The food had so much flavor and taste. It was hygienic and less oily than other Pakistani restaurants around the neighborhood. It was exactly how I wanted my Indian food to taste like and the spices are perfect despite it not being too chilly or spicy!!! Hence it is enjoyable to the American customer as well. The ambience is great. The owner is a nice Indian lady who is trying to do something different. I tried her vegan chickpea salad that was so innovative and creative, it was a fusion of Indian and western vegan taste that I absolutely fell in love with!!! I just really hope that things work out for this place and more people come! They also offer Chicken Chaap which I HAVE NEVER FOUND ANYWHERE IN THE USA!!! And I hope they continue to introduce chaap and create a demand for it because chaap is loved by all Indians! The place is cozy, clean and nice. All of this for such an affordable price!! (Price is similar to the restaurants around the area that are not clean or taste as good as this one!!!) I really hope this restaurant becomes successful because this is real, authentic Indian food cooked here and this is coming from an Indian person who just arrived to the USA.",

Loved the atmosphere, loved the bowl that came with the food, and the food it self was very good. If you're not into spicy food you'll enjoy it with no problems. If you love spicy food, like me, you'll still enjoy the different spices that was put into the food that give it the taste that wants you to eat more. I'm sure you can request the food to be spicy. Overall it's a great place for indian food!",
