These same very bad  experiene with same   person, looks like she  is the manager since she give instrunctions to the other employees, by the way; she is very rude with them  as I saw it.  There is a horrible atmosphere to be  a small branch too much time waiting for a regular coffe. Today I tried to use one of the coupons I received this week in my mail box,  I gave a second chance and take advantage of the promo. The same woman I think the manager made the opposed to what I think is the culture of your company, I wanted to start my day happy with a coffee but she made it miserable, I asked for a regular coffe and a bagel asking please give me a small package of hony for my bagel. She said she does not had honey, but to minutes earlier I saw her given two of them to smother customer. Of course, I canceled my order and left with the promise to beber come back a at the same time send this complain and share my bad experience with my neibors. Good luck",
