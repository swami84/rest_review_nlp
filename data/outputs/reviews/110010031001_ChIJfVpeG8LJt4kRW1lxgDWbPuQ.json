Their Khinkalis (Georgian dumplings) are outstanding too. Don't miss their fries. We ordered from this place like once a week. They have a great outdoor seating. They have an indoor garage door so have great air circulation. Their take out is super fast and always top notch. What else can I say, try this joint out.. we love it!!",

The wine selection is also very nice. I will probably try the pkhali, satsivi, and the spinach and artichoke khachapuri on future visits - those looked good!  The bathroom wallpaper of the translation of Diary of a Wimpy Kid in Georgian adds a really cute touch.  I would say that the first-come-first-serve aspect for the outdoor tables seems to be a bit disorganized - allowing folks to put their name down would probably make the process a bit more relaxing for customers and a lot less stressful for the staff, who seemed to have to constantly answer questions on this.",

        "caption": "From the creators of Shaw's Supra comes Table, a casual Georgian restaurant in Park View across the street from the popular bagel shop Call Your Mother Deli. Here's what's to love:  1) Food: They take traditional Georgian dishes like khachapuri (stuffed bread) and khinkali (giant soup dumplings) and add a few twists. For example, they have a dish that puts pork and pomegranate BBQ on  khachapuri (It's delicious!). Their pork and beef dumplings are HUGE so consider ordering three v. six unless you're trying to feed a group. Our toddler loved the imeruli, bread with a cheese filling. The lamb kabobs are well seasoned.  2) Space: It's a beautiful space built well for the pandemic. The walls pull up creating an open space. There are seats inside, but the outdoor patio is even larger. There's also a bar area. Inside are two murals including one that's the D.C. flag with dumplings as the stars.  Overall, Tabla is one of the best takeout food we've had in D.C. since the pandemic started in March 2020. However, I will note the takeout process wasn't as easy as other restaurants. You can't schedule pick-up ahead of time. Instead, the online menu only has an \"ASAP\" button. Since I wanted to pick up after work at 6pm, I called around 4pm. They told me to call back at 5:20pm to place an order for 6pm. I called back then and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. Since I couldn't get there in time, they told me to call back at 5:40pm. I did and was told it was a 40-minute wait. I'm sure that the system is built to help the staff, which I support, but be warned it doesn't make for a good customer experience.  Overall, Tabla is an EXCELLENT experience that will make you fall in love with Georgian food.",

The food didn\u2019t disappoint and I loved the interior and the drink options! The adjaruli khachapuri and beef and pork khinkali were delightful!  Understanding it\u2019s a pandemic and restaurants are doing their best, the service wasn\u2019t great. There were as many tables as there were staff working that evening but we only saw our waiter once the whole meal. I would have expected the manager (who was working at the bar) or the waiter who took our order to stop by to see how the meal was but we were largely left alone.",

It was the smallest one I have seen in my life, but I can forgive that in DC. The fries were okay, the pkhali was okay.  Then there is the khinkali - no juice inside at all, which is what khinkali is all about. The spicing was not my favorite, but that kind is what some people prefer (the \"qalaquri\" variant) so it is a personal preference. The overall taste was not horrible, but the small portion size for the money does not leave the client happy.  Then the ugly - The \"tkemali\" should be thrown in the bin. The \"ajika\" should be thrown in the bin. Both were watery, slimy, tasteless masses. Neither were what the name said they were. The mtsvadi was not made on embers and was a dried out, tiny piece that any regular cook can make better. The \"kababi\" was not good either.  So overall, pretty disappointing. It does not help that part of town feels like a crack-den. Also, none of the cooks are Georgian. I think I might have been the only Georgian person there. I guess a few underpaid south-American guys can not be expected to get the Georgian dishes right. Would it be so hard to hire somebody that knows what the good Georgian food actually tastes like?  The waiter was nice and helpful. The interior is nice, though I would not sit on the outdoor seating, because like I said, that part of town looks unsettling.  I really want to like it, but I can not in good conscience give it more than two stars. I will go back at some point and change the rating if it improves, but it does not look good right now. Sorry.",

I was pretty disappointed by the khinkali-- the filling was too salty and way overcooked. The slaw was solid, but it's pickled cabbage, so that's not saying much.  I was also pretty unhappy with the takeout experience. They lost my online order somehow, but they weren't apologetic at all and it took them forever to get it together, even though they have like 9 things on the menu right now. That's annoying by itself, but the worst thing was the owner/manager who kept telling my husband and me it was going to be right out, when it wasn't-- if I'd known I'd be waiting as long as I did, I probably would've chosen to wait outside, given the current conditions.  Hopefully they will get their takeout system together, but I can't see myself ordering from here again.",
