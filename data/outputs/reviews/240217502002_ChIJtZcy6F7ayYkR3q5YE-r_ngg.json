I also have a hard time spending money on food if I'm not sure that it is going to \"hit the spot.\" Glory knocked it out of the park. The donuts are amazing, but have you tried their other food?!? We had the \"Just Egg\" Sausage N' Cheese Sandwich -- heavenly! It tastes like the gourmet version of the Sausage Egg and Cheese McGriddle. I tried all the donuts available on the Saturday I visited. My favorite was donut filled with cold-brew cream; the bitter coffee taste balanced the sweet cream but also enhanced the flavor. During COVID, you cannot enter the restaurant and so order at the entrance. Surprisingly, not an inconvenience whatsoever! There is so much to do in this area. The neighborhood is beautiful and there are several other shops nearby to shop at. The staff are friendly and work quickly. Will be back!",

I saw an ingredients list that included nutmeg - I don't like nutmeg so was glad to not taste it in the dough. They were not overly greasy or heavy - they are homemade and vegan so heavier than a chain donut shop dough, but in a good way. I'd prefer slightly different flavors than what were offered but they were decent. I also had the fried ravioli and pierogi which were good if eaten hot. I feel like at least one more pierog should be included for the price. Dough dough dough. As of early September, no one is allowed in and calling ahead to order and pay seems to be the best bet.",

We sat down and waited for our drinks that never came, so I asked them again for a coffee and a water and she only returned with my coffee.

I didn't mind it on the huevos rancheros or possibly on a sandwich, but for me I don't think I would care for it by itself. We grabbed some donuts to go. They were delicious, but the texture was on the bready side, not light and fluffy. They are really good with their balance of flavors.

Only downsides are: the size of the diner is a bit cramped when busy, although a great way to meet the community, and the time, very long wait time for anything from the kitchen. I would also attribute this to size as they are a small business doing their best.  ~I only mention wait time as a warning if you are in a hurry for any reason because this place is a true Frederick gem~",

I've tried Vegan donuts before and other than the fact that they are a little chewier than regular donuts they taste pretty much the same. The shop was fairly busy when we arrived (it was a Sunday at 10 am) but I was greeted by a very helpful young man who advised me of the specials and shared his personal favorites.  I decided on 2 donuts (they do serve breakfast as well but keep in mind that seating is limited) Strawberry Frosted & a Rye Whiskey Long John. Both were very good but my favorite was the Long John, you could definitely pick up the taste of the rye whiskey, subtle and sweet. The prices are on par with what \"gourmet\" donuts are going for everywhere but it does keep people from picking up a dozen that's for sure. I also ordered an Orange Mango Juice thinking it would be fresh juice so I was a bit taken aback to see the clerk reach into the fridge and pour from a Trop 50 bottle of Orange Mango Juice. Bad enough I just paid $3 for a cup of juice but the artificial sweetener in the juice made it way too sweet with a horrible aftertaste. The staff is all very friendly and I think its awesome that they employ someone with special needs. The young man who greeted me came running outside when he saw our golden retriever and spent several minutes loving on him and chatting with us.",

The reason for 3 stars however is that their customer service was lacking and that they charge $1 for a refill of an 8oz mug of coffee. Nope sorry that is too much and it isn't posted on the sign above the register, the latter being the greater offence. Also, when there are no knives in the silverware cup, the answer is not, \"we're out of knives\" after seeing that the cup is empty. It's \"let me check the dishwasher.\" If you serve food that requires a knife to eat, then you need to have knives. Other downside is very limited seating, but they do the best they can with a small space. Over all? We'll probably go again, because the food and the donuts are awesome, but probably not as frequently as we would if the service was better.",

We both ended up getting the salted caramel apple pie stuffed French toast (don't quote me on the whole name) after learning that they didn't have any waffle options available (major bummer as that's what I went for).  The concept was interesting-a true slice of apple pie sandwiched between 2 pieces of French toast but the salt, which we believe was on the toast, was a bit overdone and overwhelmed the dish instead of being a nice balance of salty/sweet. My husband, who rarely leaves a crumb behind, didn't end up finishing his as he just could no longer deal with the overwhelming salt imbalance by the last few bites.  We also had a side of roasted potatoes which were good and we appreciated that none of our food seemed overly greasy.  We also ended up getting three doughnuts to go...I believe they were the maple bourbon, black and blue, and the smores.  The flavor of the glaze of the maple bourbon was right on but the base of the doughnut on all three wasn't anything to write home about.  The black and blue would've been my favorite if there had been more jelly filling in it.  The chocolate flavor of the smores was very natural and not overly sweetened but the doughnut felt under glazed and hence it wasn't one we'd feel compelled to buy again.  Despite not being wowed by our initial experience, we're still curious to try other dishes on the menu.  Also note that the place is tiny so securing a table for a sit down is best when the weather is nice as there are outside tables that offer a better chance of scoring any table at all.",

Decor is retro with american traditional tattoo artwork as the main motif.  The staff go out of their way to make inventive and tasty new flavors. From lavender iced classic donuts, to whiskey iced longboards, to cookie dough donuts with a whole cookie on top.  And when they say it's a vegan restaurant, they mean it. There isn't even half and half for coffee. It's not a big deal unless you have to have it as they offer 3 alt-milks like almond and soy.  So, the reason why this isn't a 5 star is pretty simple: the price.  Donuts are $3 to $3.50 each, which means you'll be dropping about $20 to get 6 donuts.  I don't mind doing that every once in a while for these delicious treats, but it's cost prohibitive for most folks.",

It was a great experience. I live an hour away and was in the area. When I saw Vegan Breakfast on the Google search, I was super excited. The place is tiny but the employees were super friendly. I had a Tofu Fried Egg sandwich w/peppers, tomato, vegan cheese on Texas Toast, Their Vegan donuts are amazing. Next time, I'm trying their Pancakes. I've been Vegan since February 2017 and this is my best vegan restaurant experience so far. I will go back again. I highly recommend this place even if you have to wait for your food. If your reading this, I hope you give Glory Doughnuts a try. Enjoy.",

The pretzel peanut butter and chocolate flavor is amazing, as well as the roasted coconut. Oddly enough, the dough of the cinnamon sugar twist tasted slightly different. It wasn\u2019t my favorite, but it was still leaps and bounds better than the generic competition.  10/10 will be back to this spot.

I like the coffee there and I absolutely love their vegan breakfast and tofu scrambled eggs... but best of all are their pancakes -- they take 20 minutes to make because they're baked in cast iron and they are the BEST pancakes any vegan or non-vegan will ever have...just thinking of them is making me salivate!

Definitely worth a day trip if you\u2019re hiking to Harper\u2019s Ferry.  If you\u2019re local, I highly recommend checking this place out.

        "caption": "Man I really want to like this place. I'm not vegan but the food is good regardless.  The donuts are freaking awesome.  The coffee is the best I've had outside of my house. As a coffee snob, I can say with confidence that this place has THE BEST drip coffee you'll find and it isn't loaded with chemicals or pollutants like Starbucks is. Yhe coffee also isnt burnt like Starbucks either. It\"s just so good!  Here's where the problem starts: logistics.  These guys are dealing with a VERY TINY space. They recently renovated it to add a few more tables, but if you come here on a weekend its nothing short of a disaster.  They are not setup to be effective with any sort of volume. There are lines out the door every Sat/Sun, and some weekdays.  Granted, the food is worth the wait. But, say you get here early and want to sit down and eat a relaxing breakfast? Well, be prepared to have a horde of people standing around you, employees doing a side squeeze to try to get around, and kitchen cook times which are pretty darn long considering there's only a handful of tables.  Which brings me to the next point.  Time. It takes an average of 4 minutes per customer, just to buy donuts and coffee. That means that out-the-door line moves slooow. They only have one register, and the new layout of the register and donuts actually makes the process slower than it was before. Combine this with no space, an awkward layout, people trying to squeeze around, and extreme temperatures outside.  It's not enjoyable no matter how good the food is.  My advice is to steer clear of this place on the weekend. Check it out during the week. It is worth a stop in.  Also, it seems sincd the renovation the donuts have not been as good.  They are not as soft as they used to be and not as flavorful. Still very good though!",

The doughnuts are wonderful and the menu they had (until December 2017/January 2018) had some wonderful gems for breakfast/lunch. Now that they've expanded a bit, it's practically a little diner and near impossible to choose what to eat! The menu has been expanded and the food options are not only plentiful but so far fantastic. You really just need to go in twice a day and order half the menu each time.",

I ordered the bakers breakfast which has potatoes, tofu scramble and toast. My potatoes were TERRIBLE. They were so undercooked I could barley push my fork through them. The tofu scramble was good and the texas toast was great. But the real saving grace was my husband stuffed french toast. It was sooo good! I would go back next time and order the french toast and to also try a donut.",

We've loved every single one that we've tried!  Besides the doughnuts, my daughter and I are both huge fans of the pancakes!  Big, fluffy, and super yummy and filling!  Good coffee to round out your breakfast experience, too.  The only real downside to this place is the size.  It is a tiny space with two small tables at the front, a couple of stools and a counter to the side, and a couple of small tables outside for when the weather is nice.  On one hand, the old building is charming and helps lend character to the shop, but on the other hand, the space is tiny enough that I've never been there when the room wasn't absolutely packed full of people.  Granted, I've only ever visited on a Saturday and a Sunday, so weekdays might be different.  I also suspect that you need to get there early to grab a seat, otherwise you're probably better of grabbing and going.  You definitely need to get there early for doughnuts as we've seen them sell out.  Parking can also be a problem, but for the majority of our visits, we've found parking on Church Street with just a short walk.  It's all street parking with no free lot at the restaurant, so bring change for the meter or be prepared to use the parking app on your phone.",
