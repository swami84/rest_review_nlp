I also have a hard time spending money on food if I'm not sure that it is going to \"hit the spot.\" Glory knocked it out of the park. The donuts are amazing, but have you tried their other food?!? We had the \"Just Egg\" Sausage N' Cheese Sandwich -- heavenly! It tastes like the gourmet version of the Sausage Egg and Cheese McGriddle. I tried all the donuts available on the Saturday I visited. My favorite was donut filled with cold-brew cream; the bitter coffee taste balanced the sweet cream but also enhanced the flavor. During COVID, you cannot enter the restaurant and so order at the entrance. Surprisingly, not an inconvenience whatsoever! There is so much to do in this area. The neighborhood is beautiful and there are several other shops nearby to shop at. The staff are friendly and work quickly. Will be back!",

I saw an ingredients list that included nutmeg - I don't like nutmeg so was glad to not taste it in the dough. They were not overly greasy or heavy - they are homemade and vegan so heavier than a chain donut shop dough, but in a good way. I'd prefer slightly different flavors than what were offered but they were decent. I also had the fried ravioli and pierogi which were good if eaten hot. I feel like at least one more pierog should be included for the price. Dough dough dough. As of early September, no one is allowed in and calling ahead to order and pay seems to be the best bet.",

We sat down and waited for our drinks that never came, so I asked them again for a coffee and a water and she only returned with my coffee. Our meals arrived only to be lukewarm, because they had been sitting on the counter for a few minutes after the chef had said \"order up\". I guess the waitress wasn't paying attention.

I didn't mind it on the huevos rancheros or possibly on a sandwich, but for me I don't think I would care for it by itself. We grabbed some donuts to go. They were delicious, but the texture was on the bready side, not light and fluffy. They are really good with their balance of flavors.

Only downsides are: the size of the diner is a bit cramped when busy, although a great way to meet the community, and the time, very long wait time for anything from the kitchen. I would also attribute this to size as they are a small business doing their best.  ~I only mention wait time as a warning if you are in a hurry for any reason because this place is a true Frederick gem~",

I've tried Vegan donuts before and other than the fact that they are a little chewier than regular donuts they taste pretty much the same. The shop was fairly busy when we arrived (it was a Sunday at 10 am) but I was greeted by a very helpful young man who advised me of the specials and shared his personal favorites.  I decided on 2 donuts (they do serve breakfast as well but keep in mind that seating is limited) Strawberry Frosted & a Rye Whiskey Long John. Both were very good but my favorite was the Long John, you could definitely pick up the taste of the rye whiskey, subtle and sweet. The prices are on par with what \"gourmet\" donuts are going for everywhere but it does keep people from picking up a dozen that's for sure. I also ordered an Orange Mango Juice thinking it would be fresh juice so I was a bit taken aback to see the clerk reach into the fridge and pour from a Trop 50 bottle of Orange Mango Juice. Bad enough I just paid $3 for a cup of juice but the artificial sweetener in the juice made it way too sweet with a horrible aftertaste. The staff is all very friendly and I think its awesome that they employ someone with special needs. The young man who greeted me came running outside when he saw our golden retriever and spent several minutes loving on him and chatting with us.",

The reason for 3 stars however is that their customer service was lacking and that they charge $1 for a refill of an 8oz mug of coffee. Nope sorry that is too much and it isn't posted on the sign above the register, the latter being the greater offence. Also, when there are no knives in the silverware cup, the answer is not, \"we're out of knives\" after seeing that the cup is empty. It's \"let me check the dishwasher.\" If you serve food that requires a knife to eat, then you need to have knives. Other downside is very limited seating, but they do the best they can with a small space. Over all? We'll probably go again, because the food and the donuts are awesome, but probably not as frequently as we would if the service was better.",
