I order a second entree to go sometimes just so I can have more leftovers the next day.  The space is a little crowded and a tight fit especially during the lunch and dinner rush, and there's often a line. If you have a few minutes to wait (or call ahead for take out) it's so worth it!  The staff are always quick and in hustle mode without losing their friendliness or attention to detail.

I get it with meatballs and it's around $13 and the bowl is large. This place has cured many hangovers and always hits the spot. The waitress remembers our order as well. The customer service is amazing  and your water glass will always be full. Being that it is a smaller restaurant in downtown Boise, there is limited seating, however I have only ever had to wait maybe once for a few minutes on a Saturday night at their peak time (in the middle of winter too). I tried pho once before having it here and I wasn't a fan, but I'm glad my husband convinced me to try it here because I am hooked!",

I ordered vegetable ph\u00f3 and while the rice noodles and ingredients were good and fresh, the veggie broth was horribly sweet and killed the natural flavors. It permeated everything. Maybe you might like that? It ruined it for me and I couldn't wait to come home for Pacific Rim Vietnamese. Otherwise I think the atmosphere and service were very good.",

Also the meat in it tasted a bit off, not obviously so but you'd get a bad bite here and there.  A weird thing was that the noodles were all different lengths, some were normal but a lot were between 1 - 3 inches long. Normally that's not a problem but in addition to the funky meat and overly sweet broth, it really felt like you were eating someone else's unfinished bowl that they tried to pass off as a fresh one.  I seriously hope that's not the case but even so this has to be the worst pho I've ever tried.",

Maybe try this place if you're looking for a very small start to viet food?  Also, I'm not sure what was going on that day but the service we had was horrendous.

I am a Vietnamese cafe owner so it\u2019s hard to be impressed by the pho, but it was fresh. I had chicken which was a light broth and I was happy with it. The beef lacked depth but flavor was good enough for him.  Server was great with bringing out sauces and extra limes!  Vietnamese coffee could have been stronger but I didn\u2019t asked for it iced at first, so that probably changed the concentration.  Can\u2019t ask for much more out of a Vietnamese restaurant.

My girlfriend and I just ordered food and sat for 40 minutes with no one coming to check for water refills. After we realized that we had been waiting for quite some time I called the attention of the server and they told me that they completely forgot to put the order in and that the kitchen was closed. Keep in mind that there were only three tables that were occupied.  The server then proceeded to offer us a laughable $10 for waiting nearly 40 minutes (that's 80 minutes of life between the two of us) of wasting our time. and then finally offered us two meals after being corrected by another server.  If you do go in make sure to speak up when your waiters are helping other tables to give them a reminder that you still exist and that you plan on giving money for their service. Because they certainly don't seem to value your time.  Worst customer service experience I've ever had.",

After we ordered, it took 50 minutes to get the appetizer and another 5 minutes before our food was served.  During the meal, our waitress bumped into our table, which caused a bit of sauce to spill onto my shirt. She also didn't notice that we were out of rice to go with a spicy chicken dish until I got up to ask for extra rice.  At the end of the meal, I asked if we could have the appetizer comped since it was 50 minutes before we got it. Our waitress told us that this was because she asked us if we wanted all the food when it was ready, and we said yes... I responded that no, I did not mean to indicate that I wanted to wait 50 minutes before having the appetizer. She shouted in response, \"We are a family owned restaurant, so I can't comp food, but I'll just take it out of my money.\" Another waiter came over. He apologized, saying that he did not know what all happened but had removed the appetizer from the bill.  I go to restaurants 3-5 times a week. In the last three years, I never asked for a part of my meal to be comped, but in this case, felt that it would make me feel a little better about the service. The waitress's reaction to my request confirmed that it really was the worst service I had had in the last few years.  On a side note... I had tried Pho Nouveau two years ago, when I ordered takeout. The container with my soup spilled all over inside the bag. The remaining soup did not taste very authentic. I had avoided Pho Nouveau since then, but had decided to give the place another chance tonight, since I really like Vietnamese food.  Regarding the confusions about whether I wanted \"all my food when it was ready\" - It seems like most restaurants will either start all of your food at the same time, and serve the appetizer and meal to you as soon as they are ready. Or sometimes they make your appetizer, wait for you to get close to finishing, then start your meal. I would have assumed that she was asking which option I preferred, and by answering \"when it's ready\", I was saying to start all of the food, and bring out each plate as soon as it's ready. In any case, I'm not sure why she would have thought anyone would want to wait 50 minutes before getting an appetizer.",

We have been a bit disappointed at the lack of really good, authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Boise, but we have been pleasantly surprised by Pho' Nuveau.  There food is absolutely AMAZING!  If you want fresh, authentic Vietnamese food, this is hands down the best in the entire Treasure Valley.  Their Salad rolls are perfect, and their Pho soups are delicious and wonderful.  We will be back very, very soon.",
