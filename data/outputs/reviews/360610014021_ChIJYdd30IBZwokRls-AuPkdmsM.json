Many of the dishes are served with an asian flair, but there are also the American classics like Maine lobster rolls. People from New England shouldn't miss out on the 1/2 lobster, because I know you guys get good ones up there, but I guarantee you've never had it made like this! This is the type of place I want to take my visitors in New York. Not overhyped as yet, but incredible. Really a hidden gem. Pro tip: One of the managers is a Sommelier and curates an excellent wine list. She's more than happy to speak about it with guests if you ask. The waiter gentleman with glasses is also very knowledgeable about wines.  Great place for a date, especially if you're going to a movie upstairs later. Food arrives quick.",

The dining starts with great suggestions and insights on the wine selection.  Several wines were suggested that would pair well with the seafood we were about to order.  It was great to have detailed knowledge of the origins of the wine as we considered our many choices.  We ended up with a great Greek wine which was perfect for the raw seafood tower. Oysters were beautiful and reasonably priced. I highly recommend the creative frozen Pickling gratinee to accompany. The stone crabs were every bit as good as those we get in Miami and better than any we find in Washington. Great aioli dip and I appreciated the medicine drop hot sauce table side to add a kick. Loved the urchins which our server helpfully explained were from Maine and therefore different from west coast ones we\u2019re familiar with. Large shrimp were fresh and delectable. Every dish that followed we superb. The HamachI was spectacular.  Lobster Bao is a must try and had a nice spicy hit. Shrimp fritters were amazing. We tried two fish dishes-the whole branzino and the Fluke. Both were very different preparations and showed off the freshness of the fish and creativity and skills of the chef. Speaking of the chef we had the pleasure to meet him. His range of tastes and the combinations he creates are amazing. Every dish sung. We were a table of 9 and everyone commented on how amazing the range of tastes we experienced were and how consistently well prepared was each dish. Get the biscuits!  Try to octopus tin. Even the fingerlings are special with a nice salt finish. Other sides are excellent as well.  Though seafood is the story don\u2019t miss the pork chop. Locally sourced, cooked perfectly and sliced for serving,  it is delicious. And be sure to enjoy the bone if you\u2019re so lucky as to nab it. If you could not tell, we loved this meal and this restaurant. Service was exceptional. And arrive a bit early to enjoy the surroundings. The Essex market is worth the visit alone. So many food shops and variety of offerings. Window shop to get your appetite ready for one great meal at Essex Pearl!",

The standouts for me were the conch ceviche, lobster bao, and the black butter branzino. All tasted fresh and flavorful. The service was attentive but not intrusive.

When walking down the main staircase this restaurant takes up your whole view and seems as if it is 80% of the entire Market!

My wife and I are not very food savvy, but Essex Pearl took care of that with detailed information, tasting recommendations, first class service, and of course most importantly DELICIOUS FOOD.  We went back the following week on date night and tried the main kitchen and were extremely impressed.
