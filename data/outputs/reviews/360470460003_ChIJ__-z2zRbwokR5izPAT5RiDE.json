I had a little cold and I was looking forward to enjoying the soup, and it was just horrendous. Imagine eating soup without any seasoning! I understand if they didn't want to add the salt for me, but they could've given me the packets. Also, the honey turkey panini is extremely overpriced ($14.50) and very mediocre: it's literally honey turkey and cheese on flat bread. I didn't mind the price initially, but I just was unimpressed with the quality. So, that's my last time patronizing them.",

That said, the service had always been spotty, but this morning, a Saturday at 8 am, the man behind the counter could NOT have been meaner!  No acknowledgment when I walked into the empty restaurant, took 3 more customers to line up behind me for him to take my order.  He wouldn't answer me when I asked what kind of flagels they had and made me guess, a major waste of time for everyone!  Two sliced flagels and two bagels with butter, not toasted should not take 20 minutes AND everyone who ordered after me was served and gone.  When I asked if my order was ready, the man behind the counter yelled at me incoherently. I still don't understand what he was talking about.  Magically, he found my order while he was yelling at me.  To top off a brutal experience, they do not enforce the mask requirement for customers. Mean and unsafe!  Lots of good bagels in Brooklyn, no need to go to one that will ruin your morning!",

I placed my order over the phone at 12:25 am and they promised me it'll be delivered in 25-30 mins. However, it was delivered at 1:50 am. The fries were soggy and panini was dead cold. I called the store immediately and asked Karen to get food picked up since there was no way I was having that quality of food.  She said call in the morning for refund and talk to owner Angelo. Angelo did not pick up calls for 2 days straight. When I told store employees that I'll dispute this transaction; Angelo finally got on the phone.  He said he cannot reverse credit card transaction (didn't give any logical reason) but he'll refund in cash and that I should visit the store. He asked me that once I'm at the store - I should ask his employees to call him. I did exactly that but when I was on the store he didn't pick up my or store employees call. I waited there 30 mins but no response. Even after that I called him multiple times next morning but he didn't pick up.  Pathetic customer service. I'm not ordering or stepping inside the store again.  Shame on Sunset bagels.",

I told him I was waiting for the bus as a polite way of saying, \u201cyou\u2019re way too god-damn slow, kiddo\u201d and - because he understood it would take even more time - he gave me the receipt and told me to keep it \u201cjust in case\u201d.

Me and my boyfriend usually order late and the instructions for delivery is to call before so they won\u2019t ring the door bell because my grandmother and mother are usually asleep but they never listen. Also the delivery takes forever, recent order it took them over an hour and a half from the time it said so I tried contacting the store before contacting seamless the self and they don\u2019t ever answer! Ever! We usually order very simple things that don\u2019t take long to make so why take 2 hours to make it and deliver it and then have your phone off so no one can call to verify what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m just going to stop trying with this place!",

That and the other diner in the plaza closes at 7pm, which is unfortunate, but Sunset Bagels is open 24/7 and they deliver at all times!  We ordered food at 3am, and while it took a while, they did deliver to us, which was impressive.  Once you figure out that you have to order at the register (so pick your salad options out before you order) it's not so bad.  Maybe not the best place to stop in for a fast coffee on your way to work, but they have an extensive menu (though I wish they had smoothies and juices like the other location) and again, are open 24/7!  Also, they are one of the only places that totally gets how to make a proper iced coffee, by dissolving the sugar in a little bit of hot coffee, and then mixing in ice and the iced coffee...their ice coffee got us through our move last summer, and I look forward to it now that it's getting warm out again.",

Upon arrival I had to wait because the person at the counter was on the phone for literally 5 minutes. He didn't even say \" I'm sorry just give me a moment\", just continued on the phone, which I thought was very rude and inappropriate for customer service. After he got off the phone he asked me what did I want. I told him that I wanted a salad but I didn't know what toppings I asked if could go to the salad bar and place my order there. He said okay; as I was standing there no one came to me to ask what I wanted.  When I said whose going to take my order the same guy in the front told me I had to go back to the register.( Why did I have to go back and forth why couldn't you just tell me that in the beginning.) After that I place my order I waited another 20 minutes; in the midst of all of this there was no one else in the store, no potential customers. When I asked what was the hold up they told me that they had deliveries but I'm the only customer in the store so how can deliveries be more important than the customer service at the actual establishment. What makes  it even worse is that there  were people in the front just talking not working.  20 minutes passed and its not until I started complaining, the manager came out and said oh you placed your order at 8:21; but at this point it was already 8:40 and this is when they started my salad and had the audacity to try to rush my salad because I started complaining.  The customer service was terrible. They were very rude and I felt racially discriminated because when a Caucasian woman came into the store she immediately got service. Being from this neighborhood I support local business however I've noticed over  the past couple months and I can tell you the quality of service has declined since it's been established little over  a year ago. I will never return back don't go to Sunset bagels and their food is not even great.",

Most of the staff is friendly but there is this guy who works there, he worked tonight the 29 of August and he wears glasses. I don't know why they haven't fired this guy. I've been to this place more than 20 times. He is so unprofessional and rude. He screams at employees and he got so mad that he started slamming food and trays. He also puts on headphones while working. He is at the FOH!! Our food always has mistakes but my boyfriend doesn't like complaining because he knows what it is like to work in a kitchen. But we are obviously fed up now because the food takes forever! It is unacceptable!!! My boyfriend says the timing is too long and the food quality does not meet the time. I just really hope they fire the guy because my boyfriend feels like screaming at him for being such a d*** head. My dad (former Chef) had a sandwich which had to be toasted and they forgot to toast it!!! Like are you kidding me!?  I like the food and we don't mind the mistakes, until now of course. I am just surprised that they haven't fired some staff. They are hispanics and my family is also Hispanic but Sunset Bagel's staff work ethic is so horrible, just embarrassing!  I hope this review is seen by the owner and changes some of his/her employees(not all of them) but specially the guy with glasses, I can't stand him!!",

I even asked the cashier that this is unacceptable and she didnt pay any mind on what i was saying to her. She gave me an attitude and said that thats how the food is suppose to look. I was very shocked about her comment. I immediately told her to give me my refund and told her im never coming back. She didnt care at all. She was very unprofessional.

I usually order here two or three times a day between my husband and i myself spending over $50 an order due to remodeling. Today i order french toast,a large orange juice, sandwich and milkshake. The french toast was burnt, the juice i wasnt avaliable so they threw in whatever instead of calling me, and the milkshake was so seperated that you could see the milk and peanut butter. I called and asked to speak to the manager because usually i dont complain when there order arrives inncorrectly but this was too much. Guess wat? the manager was too busy to speak to me (guess customers come 1st in only some places) nor did they offer to take message or my number. I spoke to scarlett who assisted me and seems to be the only one with any customer service skills. We work it out my husband will pass by later. I call later on to pre order and surprise!!! Terrible customer service. The woman set the phone down without a word once i asked to speak to scarlett and forgets about me!! Who sets a phone down without saying hold on or something to that effect? I had to hang up and call back...now i am annoyed...same woman picks up her response to just forgetting about me? \"oh yeah\" no sorry no nothing just \"oh yeah\" then she asks who i am? like really? after an unfriendly exchange in which she is every rude and even hands off the phone saying how much of a bad attitude i have(no wonder?) scarlett takes my order and i pay the different of one item. personally since pictures were sent i would have refuned the whole order. Maybe with a manager thats too busy wouldnt allow it? who knows? all i know is i wouldnt recommend this place again and sorry i did in the past as we own the business not too far down (not food). Sorry for scarlett as u can see she cares and has customer service skills. Either way, save your time and money. You'll be better for it.",

Instead of acknowledging the mistake, the guy making the bagel turned around and gave him lip. \"I don't take the orders I just make the bagels!\" .... tf? The guy had been very polite in pointing out the mistake. I figured I'd give this spot a second chance given that it's new but nope. Next time I stop by it will be to get my 6 dollars back.",

I ordered a everything bagel with cream cheese and an egg and cheese on a roll. You can get the same exact thing at the sandwich store right at newkirk plaza which is on the same block for the half the price. Like I said, this place is nothing special. Save yourself the time and money and go get your food somewhere else.",
