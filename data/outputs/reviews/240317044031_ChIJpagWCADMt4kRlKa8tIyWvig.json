I liked my chicken sandwich, the other order at the table was a burger and it was a touch over cooked.  Limited beer menu, but there was a sign for whiskey flights.  Also bartender seemed to make quite a lot of a strawberry martinis all night long so maybe beer was not the best option at this bar.  Fairly good atmosphere and staff was very nice.  Only feedback i would offer is less wait time from when we sat until we could order and the burger temp.",

The craft beer is quite over-priced, and the seared salmon was unfortunately and surprisingly overcooked. My impression is that this is a fairly new restaurant, and they are still working out the kinks. To that end, there is a lot of potential in this place if it is managed more effectively, because it is not working in its current form. For now, it was disappointing and I would not recommend this to even the hotel guests. In total, a very average rating of 3/5.",
