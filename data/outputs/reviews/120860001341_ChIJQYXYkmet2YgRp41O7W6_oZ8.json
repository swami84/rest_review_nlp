Anthony's Pizzeria has way better wings size, taste and options of how many you want to buy, their pizza is second to none and prices are reasonable for what your buying.

The white sauce that came with wings was ok not great. Bought the jar of chilly there... it was to good not to take home. Had there pizza. I love that you see how your food is being prepared. It's a bit pricey but worth the experience and food. Not a heat fan or care about owners who already got their dimes in a row.Staff is friendly. Kelly our waitress Super amazing. She listened and understood what we wanted and recommended accordingly. Everything we ate was good even the veggies. For our first time Kelly truly welcomed us.",

Let me tell you, it was AMAZING! It was one red velvet pancakes topped with yogurt and stacked with another red velvet pancakes. There was I think some kind of caramel / chocolate sauce on top. then, there was also white chocolate chips and strawberries. - Dessert We ordered the tres leches. It was pudding with ice cream. It was so good like don't even get me wrong. - People are reviewing bad because maybe they don't like dwane or because it was a small slip up. To the employees, congrats. Your restaurant is Gordon ramsey approved. :) vicky",

I asked the manager regarding our order after I saw other guests (that arrived after us) getting their big orders before us and was told there was a miscommunication between the kitchen and the computer, no one had a sense of urgency. I believe our waitress was embarrassed because she stopped coming to our table.I used to love this place but costumer service has definitely suffered. Will not be coming back",

The hospitality comes from the top down at this restaurant which is why it has such a great culture; from the director of operations, Joey, to the supervisor GG, friendliness and execution is perfect. Well done! Until next year!",

My waitress was very nice , really attentive even though we sat on the patio and she seemed to have all the incoming tables for that shift she always made sure we were ok. Here is were the restaurant gets a 1 star because of the chef on duty. My husband ordered a medium + steak and it cane out well done .  Our waitress offered to have it re cooked but she asked we put it on a separate plate and my husband can eat his sides until it came back out . I ordered the filet snapper . The rice was really good but the snapper had way too many bones in it . Like the chef that came out and told us that fish has bones like we were confused. I understand it has bones and you can\u2019t get all of them but this was more then two bones sir! And before you want to shout how much of a 30 years experience chef you are you might want to teach your line cooks how to filet a fish properly! And the Southwest shrimp was way to salty and to much sauce made the bread soggy . I paid for my my app and 2 rounds of drinks not because of the food but the chefs attitude. He turned a 300$ table into $80 . Fortunately our night was saved by international smoke house right up the street. Great service great food great drinks.",

I heard he opened a restaurant in Aventura but had no idea this was the one LOL. :) I actually was just searching on Yelp for happy hour around the area outside of the mall.  I walked in and sat at the corner of the bar. It was slow but there were about 5 or 6 people sitting down and it kinda felt awkward. There was no music in the background and nobody was really talking so it wasn't lively, to say the least. At least the bartender greeted me with a smile and took my order right away. I got the UD's Wings (Calabrian Chile with creamy gorgonzola dip) and the Baby Back Ribs. Both were pretty good. The wings were flavorful and the ribs were very tender. They were affordable too. Just less than $10 each. For drinks, I just got Wynwood La Rubia draft for $5 but they do have select cocktails on HH as well for $7.  For now, 4 stars until I try the rest of the food but from browsing the regular menu, it ain't cheap.  Apps average around $15 and the entrees are about $35 per dish. Maybe I'll try the pizza next time but they are about $17 so hopefully, one pie is big enough. Plus they also offer Fireman Derek's pies for dessert so that's something to consider.",

Fish was not well cooked and being that I and most of Miami are from the Caribbean and Latin America, we clean our fish properly by removing guts and tongue and gill. This fish was cooked with the inner gill blood. Gross. My other 6 guests had salmon (nothing to wow) and also the Wade burger which was just another burger rely with some exotic cheese. The shrimp appetizer was actually the best followed in close second by the meatballs. After that everything was just overpriced Applebees in my opinion based on the food, the seasoning and taste, and my knowledge and experience. You can go once or twice.",

This place has the best wings I have ever had. The tender wings are drenched in a sweet, spicy, salty, savory sauce. They go perfectly with a hefty serving of gorgonzola dressing. I don't even like wings but I will come here for their hot, fall-off-the-bone wings!  Of note, the right side of the bar is a workstation so in order to not be in the way I will try to avoid sitting on that side next time.",

The artichokes, the Shishito peppers, Salmon....    I could go on and on.... The ambiance was relaxed and unpretentious...    a bar with 3  tv.screens and a quasi industrial dining room....   the place offers a terrace area for al fresco diners...  though in S Florida temps under 70's is considered cold so no one was using it....  Bravo ..800 degrees.  You do bring something good, I'd say great to Aventura...   different and quite welcomed for us the locals.....  the offering was excellent for adults and well suited for kids ...   our 7 and 8 year old... are already looking forward to return.",

My friend and I couldn\u2019t decide what to order but our amazing server Nathan was quick to greet us and explain the menu and some of his favorite dishes. We went with Nathan\u2019s recommendation\u2019s and shared the UD Wings and the BBQ chicken Pizza. The wings were out of this world!! Our server had amazing timing and an eye for perfection, our table was cleared as soon as we were done with our our appetizer and he was sweet enough to bring us finger wipes. Minutes later our pizza was brought to us and it not only looked amazing but wow was it everything and more than you expect from a pizza. We turned down an alcoholic drink when we first sat but Nathan brought the menu over to our table and said he wanted to describe a few cocktails that are a must try. He was so sweet so we decided to try the drinks he suggested which were froze and the pre-game warm up 10/10. We were too full for dessert but the options sounded delicious so definitely will coming back and will make sure to save room next time .... food, service and atmosphere was great. Overall highly recommended trying this place out!",

We get there no ine was there to greet us we waited a few minutes then someone showed up. We decided to eat outside the weather was pretty nice that night. The tables were not cleaned off properly still water mark ledts from the previous customer. We waited about 5 minutes for the waitress eventually she came very nice young lady. Let me not forget and add this some type of alarm kept going off and on for a while a bit annoying. We received our drinks i just asked for a sprite which by the way was watered done yuck. The menu was pretty blah not much of a selection. Finally we got to order I wanted rotisserie chicken but we were told they had no more chicken. \ud83d\ude15\ud83e\udd14 hmm funny there was lots of chicken cooking from whatvwe could see thru the window. Ok whatever so I went for a margharita pizza but after that the waitress goes and says if you want chucken you can order the bbq CHICKEN pizza we have enough for pizza. \ud83d\ude10 really? Ok .. Why not. So we ended up ordering bbq chicken pizza,greek salad (which was pretty good) and some wings those were good too. Personally it was an ok place not all like they said it was. Too much hype maybe because of who owns it I probably wont be back. Give it a try maybe you will like it more than we did.",

The rice was overcooked (mushy). The beans had no taste. I ordered the wings, which was ok. No big deal. While at our table, 2 families came into the restaurant. One of the families was seated. I guess when they saw the menu, it wasn't pleasing to them because they walked out. The other family walked into the restaurant looked at the menu at the door and turned around and left. Not a good look. Bathroom also needed to be cleaned. Toilet paper not placed where it should be. This was our first and last experience eating from this place.",

I found the food to be extremely overpriced, bland and unappealingly charred while the pizza was edible there was entirely too much wood residue on the crust and even directly on the pizza it was rather unappetizing. The U.D Wings are tasty, at all with the assistance of their dipping sauce which is a blue cheese substitute you will surely appreciate!!! The ginger ale I got was flat and there were a massive variety of cutezy miniature visitors everywhere that my children seem to come across from the time we sat down before we got any food. Which is no problem had the flies not attempted to sample all of our dishes forcefully. The tiny flying ladybug like creature yellow in color wasn't so bad she was very brief. I must say the carrot cake was interesting to say the least it was subtle and moist but a tad boring also, we wanted to be blown away!!!! For the love of basketball we may venture in once more on a date night, MAYBE!!!!! Thanks so much to the wait staff they were out of this world in fact at one point we had a handful of people checking up on us and bringing things to our table. I love that. Our waitress I was knowledgeable, bubbly, and attentive.",
