The quality of the food for the prices are subpar and the service is less than professional. The cashier/owner is not too friendly or customer-service oriented. I ordered the tuna combo special and the tuna was watery. When I asked for a refund, she became defensive stating that I could exchange it for something else because she was taking a loss. The problem was my exchange was $2.00 less and she did not want to offset it with a soda or chips. Who tells a customer they can't have their money back because the business will take a loss? What a thing to say to a loyal customer that didn't want to get sick off of bad tuna. Please people..go to Subway and eat fresh.",
