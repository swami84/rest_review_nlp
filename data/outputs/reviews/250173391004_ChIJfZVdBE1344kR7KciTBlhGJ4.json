I like this place because they have organic options compared to other restaurants, but maybe that's going away since I don't see that in there website like before.  They are intense about COVID. Barricaded doors with chairs. They drop food outside door and you pickup. Wouldn't let me go inside.",

Also, lo mein, chicken fingers(very nice!) and scallion pancakes that I find to be be the best around, by far, and thise come with a terrific soy ginger sauce.

There were only 5 of us and they gave us a table big enough for 8-9 people, which we thought, great, more space. Except when food came, we all had a hard time reaching for food that weren't directly in front of us. The servers also couldn't reach us because all the dishes she brought out, she left it at one side of the edge, making it even harder for us to reach it. My suggestion is invest in a lazy Suzy.",

The food was good & taste wise it was just right. The noodle soup was delicious as well as  the shrimp tempura. Service was strange to say the least as this was my first time there trying to read through their extensive menu & I felt rushed to make a decision, & there was nobody there. I didn\u2019t even have time to finish my appetizer when the main course was already coming felt so fast & my apps were getting cold. In the end the food was good but overall experience was sub par.",

On our recent visit however we waited 10 minutes and the waiters brought food to the nearby tables, got them their check, went back and took their money, returned and gave them change, and then disappeared.  They never said a word to us.  It wasn't even very busy, we were the fifth table I think.  We got up and left.  I am not going to reward poor service.  Get your act together.  It isn't hard to get customers a beer or Coke while they wait.  Let me order some miso soup.  At least I would be trapped at that point, having drank your beer, and you could then ignore me over the next two hours and I couldn't leave.",

I ordered the House Hot Sake which came out at the perfect temp and taste. I was then given a complimentary order of what seemed like an orange pickeled cabbage with slices of avocado. Very tasty! I then  ordered the Sashimi Sushi Combo with a side order of sashimi octopus. The octopus was the freshest I've ever had and were thick slices. The rest of the meal was expertly prepared with attention to the presentation. Sashimi was again cut thick and melted in my mouth. The sushi was a crunchy roll that had a great blend of tastes. The whole meal was the perfect amount of food for a hungry person. I ended with a Sapporo beer and thanked the chefs for a wonderful dinner. I would highly suggest to have dinner here if you love sashimi! I'll be back!",

Instead of getting some back up from the kitchen or management there was only one poor waitress trying to ferry the food and take orders for the whole restaurant. I have been on quieter nights and the service was always fine. This night was an exception. Just can't understand how someone from the back did not come out and help the one waitress though. The sushi is fantastic however. Order out or done in on a quiet night. Yummy.",

There was only one person staffed in the front-of-house and that person was responsible for being hostess, inputting online orders to the system, and performing waitress duties for the entire restaurant.  Given the volume of online orders we witnessed, it was clear that one person is not enough to handle the load.  To make it worse, it was clear that the priority was processing of the online orders rather than making the in-restaurant experience enjoyable.  We waited 12 minutes to be seated (while watching online orders be input), watched and waited as our prepared rolls sat idle for at least 5 minutes at the sushi bar, and didn't receive our drink order until after the main course came.  Maybe there was a circumstance on this day that we are not aware of which resulted in the restaurant being understaffed, but if it's standard practice to have only one person on staff then I would not recommend dining in here.",

The staffer we were talking to said he wasn't authorized to do anything about it, and said the manager wasn't at the restaurant (on a Saturday evening!).  We left and grabbed the same items at Nagoya, a new place just around the corner. Highly recommended Nagoya!  I've had food from Blue Fuji before and it's fine, but avoid the hassle of dealing with them.",

The first time I went with my partner, we sat at the table for about half an hour before a server even acknowledged us. Normally, the first question you are asked is what you would like to drink, but the server went straight to asking (rather impatiently) if we were ready to order yet.  The food was actually pretty good, but it took much longer than expected to arrive. Instead of asking about desserts, etc.,  we were abruptly given a bill and feeling incredibly rushed to leave.  We decided to try it again a few months later, hoping that perhaps they were just off their game that night. We walked in and we're completely ignored by the hoses. After waiting about 15 minutes, we just went to the bar and asked to be seated. The bartender seemed to be looking for a table, but never came back to follow up. After bring ignored by the hostess for yet another 15 minutes, we decided that the food, while good, was not special enough to tolerate the complete lack of professional service this place provides.  If you like to be ignored, rushed, and average food, this is your joint. However, if you like fast, friendly service, reasonable prices, and good food, check out some of their competition in Medford Square.",

They deliver in a relatively timely manner but I definitely recommend going into the restaurant for the full experience. The staff is great and the sushi chefs are amazing. They make lots of different, very inventive types of maki rolls that are delicious. I had never been on such sushi adventures before going to Blue Fuji. Their chinese food is also good but their sushi shines! If you happen to make it for lunch their bento boxes are a really good value and delicious as well.  If you go, make sure to ask about any special makis they have. My mind was blown last night.",
