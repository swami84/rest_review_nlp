You could literally hear me tapping on the bread.the meat on the inside was cold. I definitely will not go back. The lady asked if my bf wanted garlic bread with his chicken parmesean but didn't bother telling us that it was extra. Then she added her tip to the ticket and decided not deserve any of it. While we were there she was in and out of the front door. She bought some bananas from some guy and didn't even go wash her hands. After we got done eating we saw her outside smoking a cigarette and she went back in and went straight to another table she was serving. Did not wash her hands.

We also read that the tiramisu desert here was supposedly a local favorite. Well the wife and I split one and IT WAS SERIOUSLY THE BEST TIRAMISU WE BOTH HAVE EVER HAD!

I was hungry and overheated so my husband and I were desperate to find a restaurant that wasn\u2019t so crowded. The manager or owner? Of Frank\u2019s restaurant was standing outside trying to get people to come in. That should have been red flag number one, but we were desperate so we went in. It was air conditioned and felt amazing. But then, our waitress was really lacking in the customer service department. I don\u2019t even remember her name but she didn\u2019t smile once, and almost acted like we were wasting her time. Anytime she would set something on our table she\u2019d set it down and kind of heavily sigh and say \u201chere you go\u201d and walk away without asking if we needed anything or even giving us a glance. It was weird. I had the shrimp po\u2019boy. And honestly it wasn\u2019t half bad, I\u2019d order it again. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and said it wasn\u2019t good. Also... $4.50 for a side of fries which weren\u2019t seasoned or salted at all, and $4.50 for a side of garlic bread. In all, we spent $50 on a very mediocre lunch and dining experience and we left pretty unsatisfied. I also forgot to mention another employee was speaking to someone on the phone very loudly for all to hear and was being really rude to whoever was on the other line (it sounded like a customer but can\u2019t say for sure) he was describing the ingredients for one of their dishes and then proceeded to call whoever it was a \u201cdumbass\u201d and was visibly getting frustrated. It was uncomfortable. We had our 10 month old infant with us so would have appreciated a better environment and better service but what can you do i guess. For our first real dining experience in NOLA it was disappointing.",

We were on our way to another restaurant when Joey stopped us on the sidewalk to give us a rundown of what the menu was all about and to convince us to head inside and give it a try. I am SO HAPPY we decided to eat here.  We were seated immediately and Kathy was our server.  She was sweet and attentive while at the same time joking with our group....named my friend Beth and called her that for the next 2 days when we would walk by.  We ordered drinks and a few appetizers before ordering our entrees.  After we sat down, we immediately struck up a conversation with one of the owners, Frank, and soon had Jack, another owner involved too.  Both guys are awesome and shared story after story with our table.  Now comes the best part....the food!!  Our group ordered a range of food that night.  From the seafood pasta to the steak wagyu, EVERYTHING was great!  I can honestly say that I had the best meal I have ever eaten that night.  My husband and I would go back in a heartbeat!!!!  Once we were finished it came time to pay the bill.  There was an 18% gratuity added to the bill, and I was absolutely alright with it.  In an area that is full of tourists and lots of alcohol, I think it's important to protect your servers and employees that work hard for these businesses.  Every restaurant we went to for our trip added a gratuity to our table.  We added more money to the tip each time we visited a restaurant.  Our bill, before the gratuity was added, was about $350.  I found it to be reasonable as we had the majority of our group drinking tasty Hurricanes and we ordered a ton of food.  All in all, this place was amazing!  Thank you to Joey for convincing us to come inside.  Thank you to Kathy for the great service.  Thank you to Frank and Jack for the great conversations and stories.  For all of that, we will be back!!!!",

I play life by chance and have really got home runs that way, but this time I don't know where I should start. We walked up to the outside and what appeared to be an owner or manager greatest us and started rattling off specials. We decide to try it out and head inside.  Our \"waitress\" sat us down and never once said a word to my wife. I said I would like to try that special on the BBQ shrimp and surprise me with an entre y'all are known for. She smiles and says I'm getting the snapper plate.  The shrimp flavor was top notch but they were severely overcooked. Very difficult to peel and over all a mess. The main course set me up to be very excited. Man I was crushed. The shrimp in this plate tasted delightful of butter and clearly overcooked, but flavor was on. The pasta was good, but dang the fish...  Apparently I got Red Snapper. It may have been Red Fish, wasn't paying that close of attention. Either way i had to clarify what I ordered later because I couldn't tell if it was veal or fish. Seriously. It was heavily coated in seasoning and then pressed flat for long enough that the first would not pull the flakes off as designed.  Total waste. So I called for the bill and ended this nightmare. Ready for the second to best part? The \"waitress\" comes up and says you sure you don't want to finish this or take it with you? When I declined she just walked away in true shock.  The best part? By now we have read the reviews, made the decision to just leave and mark a 10% tip to avoid an issue and bail. I get the bill. $83 with an added 18% tip built in?! What in the actual hell? I live in tourist Central and that's only added on peak times or large parties, neither of which were the case here.  Avoid this place. Just keep walking and go anywhere else. The bread in the pic smelled burnt, the food was terrible and the service was trash. The best part was how entertained I was watching what appeared to be the owner hootin and hollering with his pals about the news and the crowds outside. Unprofessional, but I needed something to do while they overcooked all our food.",

This is the only restaurant on Decatur that has a barker at the door trying to generate business, all the others I've seen are on Bourbon Street, which I guess should have been a clue. $33 before tip for a meatball PoBoy (with cheese - extra) and french fries (extra) and a rum and coke. Have been to N.O. at least 10 times and walked by it every time so wanted to check it out, now I'm all set forever. How can a rum and coke here cost more than a grasshopper at Tujaques?

Atmosphere was warm and muggy. Ordered a mixture of things, seafood platter(fried oysters were awful), corn bisque(never got delivered), creole shrimp(these were huge!! Husband said they were great) And their famous muffalata which was pretty good and the 1/2 was gigantic came with no side though :(  Waitress came and brought check, we told her the corn bisque never came and needed to be removed. At this point our ck was 96$... She came back with the receipt and had removed the soup but ADDED 18% gratuity which bumped  our ck to 106$+ when she came back we said no we would not be doing the gratuity like that and she said well it's because there is an \"event\" going on. Obviously there was no event so we said no to fix it. She huffed and mumbled under her breath then brought back the check minus the gratuity. We paid. Left and won't be back.",

(0 Cars in the 5 or so spaces even after an hour+ in the place) *This was warning sign #1. As we decided to go inside we were rushed in by what I can only assume was a cook having a smoke break in front of the restaurant.  **Warning sign #2. Originally given our run of the place one of the waitstaff suggested we go upstairs because the waitress up there hadn't had a table all day long  this wouldn't have been a flag at all had it not been 1 P.M. ***Warning sign #3 Being hungry  (and realistically already there) we decided to go up stairs and sit by the windows.  The waitress that greeted us was friendly and shortly after we sat (Within a couple mins) there was another table.  After getting our drinks and ordering ( I got the Half Muffuletta that came with no sides for $12 and my wife ordered a basic burger that came with fries) the table that sat after us got their meal first. Followed by the waitress delivering the remainder of the other tables food as well as ours.  Or so I'd like to say because due to the very old and uneven floor our waitress tripped falling flat and dropped our plates on the floor.  I understand accidents happen however after waiting AGAIN for our food no one came to speak to us not a manager not an owner.  The waitress comes up the stairs in tears because the monster that was running the place not only made the woman pay for the food she dropped (BECAUSE OF THE POOR CONDITION OF THE FLOOR) but was sending her home after the two parties that were upstairs left because of this.  Our food finally arrived the second time my sandwich coming out first and my wife's burger and fries about 5 mins later.  The sandwich was good my only critique was the bread was over toasted (Not a big deal) My wife's burger was alright (Not seasoned and very basic).  We finished our meal and asked for the check (Full price despite the issue), we paid in cash leaving and decided that that would be the last time we would ever visit that establishment. Over all Service *** (The woman wasn't having her best day but she was trying) Food ** (Very basic food nothing to write home about) Price * (Chicken Alfredo was $20 and that was about the average plate) Management * (Never spoke to a manager and didn't really want to) P.S. The woman at the other table tried to use the restroom but it wouldn't flush.",

I got the $30 ribeye, the most expensive steak I've ever had, and it was by far the worst one I've ever had. The whole thing tasted burnt, and it was extremely fatty. The waitress told me, \"we can't help it if you order something you don't like.\" How am I suppose to know I won't like it?! There was 5 other people in my party, and they let me try their food. While the portions are big, it does not mean anything if all the food is bland. The waitress we had, I think Margret was her name, had our drinks waiting for 10 minutes beside her, and completely forgot about them. Someone from our group and to go inside and ask for them, and they told us we are already received our drinks. The automatic 18% gratuity that is added to the check is just an excuse for poor service,  and still getting paid. You also cannot split checks here! You would think a restaurant would advertise that before the end of the meal. The owner/manager was the worst part. He would not take the steak off the ticket, and was cursing about other customers to the wait staff. He was also wearing a batman t-shirt to represent a place that prices their food like it is fine dining.",

We had to wait about an hour for garlic bread that arrived burnt. Left a really sour taste in our New Orleans trip. And the waiter wanted to really shame you into ordering more stuff without telling you how much is that going to charge you. They also add an automatic 18% gratuity.  Also they just have one dingy washroom for a two-storeyed store. You cannot get away with that when your dishes are so overpriced.",

Food wasn't bad but nothing special and the employees were arguing with each other and rude. Waitress named Kathy was useless. No drinks refilled and she was NOT busy. Meals were not brought out together and there was only two of us. We paid cash to make sure we weren't overcharged as some reviews have mentioned. I WOULD NOT recommend wasting your time or money there. We eat out 7 days a week. This was waaaayy below what we expected. I don't know how they've stayed in business so long if this is the norm.",

My own plate, the ravioli, was very basic and flavorless with an incredibly small portion, especially for the price. Their automatic gratuity of 18% to parties over five apparently gives the servers a pass to be rude, unfriendly, and unwilling to help or offer any compensation for a forgotten plate. We had to leave and asked to just take the last dish off since it still wasn\u2019t ready but they were incredibly insistent on us waiting for it and eating it instead of just apologizing. The waitress also spilled some of the food on the table when she was setting it down. There\u2019s far, far better places to eat and for a lot cheaper. Don\u2019t waste your time or money here.",

        "caption": "This is going to be a three part review:  Part 1: Food was Amazing (For what we had), had the spaghetti with meatballs \"Excellent\". Big helping and could be shared easily with two people. My girlfriend had a Shrimp Po Boy and it was good, as in the other reviews bread was soggy, however, they can fix that by putting the veggies on bottom and putting shrimp on top. Was kinda dry, so maybe a special sauce for it would be a stand alone masterpiece!  Part 2: Our waiter was excellent, however, we witnessed first hand him and another waiter bickering about who filled the Tarter Sauce last and how each other rolls silverware tighter and the other waiter said to our waiter as he was walking away \"dont talk to me like that it wont be good for you\" almost was ready to throw down. I piped up and told the other waiter \"hey, we are not here to listen to that to please stop\". He apologized and it wasnt an issue again. However, it made other guests and ourselves uncomfortable and ruined the atmosphere. The other waiter said to us when we left he didnt like our waiter and hated him.  Part 3: A special shout out to the Front Door employee, he was amazing (Joe or Joey). He was very attentive when we first chose to eat here and cared about our experience afterwards.  My suggestion is to look at these reviews (Owner) and change for your clientele. You of course will not make everyone happy, however, looking at the reviews about employees arguing in front of customers was mentioned in several reviews, I would make sure that never happens. Also listen to the food complaints, like I said you cant please everyone, but there is things that can change easy to improve the dish that gets your customers coming back.  Overall I would go back to give it another shot. Like I said our food was Excellent!",

He had a large group and stayed at their table the entire time fawning over them and talking about his lingerie. Another waiter came up, got our food and disappeared. I told woman downstairs that service was bad,but she didn't seem concerned. In fact, I picked up water pitcher and served myself while talking to her. We have always loved Frank's and had great service but to add insult to injury...they added a 18% gratuity bc it is Memorial weekend. Sorry Frank's, you just lost me.",

The only reason for not a 5 star review was our waitress wasn't so warm at first and I still kinda prefer the central grocery muffulettas.

The calamari was mediocre, my chicken parmesan was bland and my chicken was burnt, and my husband's seafood platter came out cold.  He mentioned it to the server and one of the managers, but they both overlooked it.  Poor customer service along with not the best of food equals, never to return to this restaurant ever again.  We wanted some good Italian food, but I should have read the reviews before we chose to come here. The best thing we had there was the garlic bread.  Our bill was over $100 and was a complete waste.

This was our first time to have one, although they have been a regular since I was a child. I usually don't eat olives but knew if your in NO you eat it the way the chef intended. Cute spot that was going from family friendly to a romantic spot transition while we were there. The table was covered with butcher paper, and they gave crayons for the kids to draw on it.
