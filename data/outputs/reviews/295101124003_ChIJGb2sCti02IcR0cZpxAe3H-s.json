Pickles is a little unassuming as you pass by on Euclid, but the sandwiches and soups are high-quality and delicious.  A Rueben is my go-to sandwich anywhere, and Pickles' Reuben can compete with the best around.  And it's not just their Reuben--everything they made is fantastic, and the variety of great sandwiches they offer makes it easy to keep coming back and never getting bored.  But don't go just for the sandwiches--the soups are amazing (and sometimes maybe even more of a draw)!  They offer two rotating soups every day, ranging from chili to French onion to even lobster bisque--highly endorse them all.  As I holed up in my apartment for the beginning part of the pandemic to finish my dissertation, lunch from Pickles a few times a week was one of the rare highlights--it's one of the things I miss most about St. Louis!",

Choose between corned beef, pastrami, or my favorite, a combo. Both meats are shaved, cooked properly and neither too fatty nor dried out. The sauce is just right. The bread is perfectly toasted, and both sides remain correctly crisp (something of a Reuben unicorn) thanks to just the right amount of sauerkraut: enough to be very present in the overall flavor without being bulky and overpowering and making the sandwich soggy. Add great sides, a snappy dill pickle spear and excellent service and if you're like me you'll drive to a part of the city you dont often need to drive to just for the experience. Highly recommended.",

The issue would probably not have presented itself if the,  I believe, manager would not have been ear hustling and telling the cashier what to enter while I ordered.  In ordering a French Dip, the only request I made was to not have the meat dipped in the aujus (making the bread wet) while still having the aujus on the side.  Manager's reaction was not pleasant after I returned the cold sandwhich to be heated (and my cheese melted).  Regardless of the cooking process, I never asked for a cold sandwich and if they were unclear, I would have been happy to explain what I was wanting.  I did not care that the managers reaction was unpleasant, I did not care that he used his hands to cook my meat (with gloves he just used to touch the Ipad), I did not care that he crammed my sandwich back into the container (now leaving out the pickle) and I did not care after asking for the pickle, another staff person placed the same pickle that was sitting on the cutting board into my container.  It's OK though, I know that it's best, that my money can be best spend elsewhere!  Sadly, this is how I've always ordered a \"modified\" french dip with no questions asked.",

        "caption": "Sandwich Club STL visited Pickles Deli on Saturday around 1pm. We did a little research online beforehand to find a lot of good reviews and praises. We thought we better check it out for ourselves. First impressions upon walking in is the the layout is well planned with plenty of tables and its clean. The chalk board behind the counter is well laid out with some deli standards like a Ruben,Beef Dip,Meatball & Clubs. You can also create your own sandwich from a pretty wide array of ingredients too. The staff was friendly and patient with some our less decisive members.The service was also pretty quick. Each of these traits earns them a star.We ordered The french Dip :-1/2lb. shaved roast beef with melted swiss & au jus on a warm french roll. Which was awesome BTW Not soggy or fatty and the meat was of good quality. The portion size was good too not too big but not too small either, just right.We also ordered a Ruben :-corned beef or pastrami with sauerkraut, swiss cheese & 1,000 island dressing on grilled marble rye. One member said it was one of the best sandwiches shes had yet & we eat a lot of sandwiches. We got two Pickles Clubs one on Marbled rye and one on a pretzel bun. Oven roasted turkey breast, ham, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado spread, Both were received well. We also got a New York Pastrami which I heard was excellent. Unfortunately our Meatball expert wasn't with us this time, (he's very picky, Lol) we'll have to go bring him next time. Over all we were very happy with Pickles. We think it deserves 5 stars all around.If you happen to be in the CWE and hungry you really cant go wrong here. Its Great. Oh and they have Beer and Wine (in a can). Fortheloveofsandwiches.

I have always gotten either a pastrami Reuben or a Cuban sandwich and this time I decide to get a Cuban sandwich with a side of dill potato salad.  The potato salad was amazing but when I got to my sandwich first bite I noticed it was very dry it was like it was made and left on the counter for a while which made the meat crunchy around the outer edge and dry in the center and then the bread was stale and chewy. I don't know why this sandwich had to be different from all the other times that I went here I felt like I paid $11 for a sandwich and side in the side was the only thing that was delicious.  When people don't care or have a bad day usually the food gets mistreated and then someone has to get on here and make comments like this.",

The pickle was good and so was the lobster bisque even though it was served a bit colder than I would have hoped. However, they warmed it up via microwave for us, no problem. My friend really liked his philly cheesesteak. I was surprised to find out that they don't have a 1/2 soup, 1/2 sandwich deal- though they will serve a 1/2 sandwich for 1/2 price of the full.",
