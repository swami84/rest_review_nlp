Each day I went I was told different things, such as pickles, lettuce and other add on's that typically go on a burger was an up charge.  The burgar was 6$ and if you were to add anything they charged full price of 15$.  Even a side of pickles they wanted 9$.  One order I didn't get fries, the other 3 times I did for free, and they charged 1$ to add truffle oil.  Everytime I ordered they messed it up, even repeated my order 4 different times, they forgot the Walker's sauce they said came with the burger each time.  When i asked about it, they said it was on the burger.  It was not.  I guess you get what you pay for??",

It literally looked and tasted like a peice of beef jerky. I ordered the crispy calimari the flavor was there but so overcooked as well that I couldn't finish it.We left still hungry and highly dissatisfied. This was our first time eating here and last don't waste your money. I gave it one star because I had to and I did order a bottle beer that tasted ok.",

The scrambled eggs had sat out too long then the new batch were barely cooked. The only other things fit to eat was the cold foods like yogurt and fruit. Even some of the pastries were flavorless and hard after sitting out too long. Super super overpriced for the quality of food. Do not recommend & won't be back.
