        "caption": "I used to go to China Fast Wok south on California for my Chinese fixing, but Wok! You Want blows the old neighborhood Chinese joints out of the water.  I was seduced by the picture of the Hong Kong Steak, but it treated me properly upon delivery to my oral orifice. It was actually very tender and flavorful with a substantial amount of both meat and veggies in the box. The boxes - by the way - are excellent food containers.  Who would\u2019ve known that salt and pepper pork was the greatest Chinese dish out there? I didn\u2019t until I tried what they\u2019ve got here. The breading is light and salty and the peppers had a wonderful flavor and bite. I took the leftovers in the morning and made some of the best fried rice I\u2019d ever eaten.  Salt and pepper anything is great here. And something that I find is rare at most restaurants which is found here is the noticeable orange flavor in the orange chicken. It was actually refreshing to eat. The dumplings/gyoza/potstickers are my favorite type which is the big fat doughy ones with a chunk of ground meat inside. The fried chicken as well was rightfully salty and crispy.  I\u2019ll have to edit this review if I ever come across a dish I don\u2019t like but I doubt that day will come. I look forward to a long life for this restaurant.",
