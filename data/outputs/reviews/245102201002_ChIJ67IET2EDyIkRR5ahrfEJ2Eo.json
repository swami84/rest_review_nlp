He is VERY good and professional at his job. The place was slow early on the evening we stayed. He kept the bar open even though he could have gone home. A hour later a wedding party filled the place. I had asked a local about visiting a potentially less expensive bar in the area. Thank goodness, I did not follow through at plan. Very comfortable with a great view of the Harbor. There is no view at the local place.",

Good.. but nothing special For a hundred dollar meal overall it was not worth it but was tired after a long day so it filled the hole.  Would not recommend...  no telling what you will get.",

The staff was extremely friendly and Zack...he's was excellent!  The only thing I can say is the theme was a bit confusing and the space was utilized in an extremely foolish way considering the market.  I think a fun, unbeat, more hip bar overlooking the waterfront would be much more lucrative and more enjoyable to hotel patrons.  I didn't feel like I was dying in the bar, I felt like I was dead already...That's how our dated it was! Despite this downfall the service was excellent and I would no doubt return just because of the Service",
