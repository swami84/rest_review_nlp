Using google translate I called back and politely asked for the manager repeatedly, at which point they passed the phone around to each other, toying with me, and mimickong me in the background for five minutes. I could hear at least two staff members mocking my attempts at communication, and several other girls laughing the whole time as if this were some joke to them. These people seriously lack class. Once I got to the restaraunt, I did my best to act like I wasn't bothered by the awful waiting service I received, and the food looked as if someone had just thrown some cheese rice and beans onto a plate haphazardly and hoped it would settle into an appetizing dish, but it did not. The food was crap, the staff made this experience even worse. I will never come here again, and implore all of you to skip this destination if you are looking for a meal.

It was like a mini Haussner's with paintings hanging everywhere.  The waitress spoke absolutely no English at all.  I mean other than the items on the menu, it was impossible to communicate with her, because I don't speak Spanish. We had to try three times to get a beer that they weren't out of. The only soda they had was Coke.  But, the food was nothing short of  excellent. Large portions, very spicy, and very good. The black beans were sublime.  All the ingredients were fresh, and everything was spicy hot.  I went there with three other people and all of us really enjoyed our meal.   At the end of the meal, we spoke to the owner and he was just the nicest guy.  I get what all these other reviewers are saying because if you're looking for a generic, chain restaurant, Don Pablo's kind of experience this is not the place for you. But if you're looking for a quirky, different kind of  experience that you could only get in Balwmer, then Carolina's is an absolute must.",
