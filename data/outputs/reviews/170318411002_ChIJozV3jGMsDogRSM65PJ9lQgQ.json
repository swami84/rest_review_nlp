While we are not very adventurous when it comes to Asian food, we pretty much stick with the usual. I have tried many of their veggies. Absolutely cooked to perfection. Steamed just right, no excessive seasonings, good service, good portions. Priced right. We have ordered several carry out since pandemic.  One of our favorites",

Food was prepare very quickly we didnt have to wait more than 10-15 minutes,we ordered about 5 different dishes and everything came out at the same time and with no issues at all,food had a good taste.  Service was regular,server didn't come as often as we needed and was very distant....maybe it was just an of night for her. I would definitely visit again and maybe I can update my review and give then 5 stars.",

I wasn\u2019t happy because they automatically charged about 15-18% \u201cservice fee\u201d on our bills. That\u2019s just ridiculous. I have eaten at many restaurants and yet the only place charged me for service fee was a 5-star restaurant. I didn\u2019t leave any tip because the service fee they charged me served as tip. If I left another 15% on top of their service fee, wouldn\u2019t it be 30% tip? - I don\u2019t think so because it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.  Would not return or recommend anyone here because the food tastes okay and they automatically charge service fee. Ridiculous. The staffs were nice though. But no. I wouldn\u2019t return.",

That in addition to a lot of factors came into play.  First, they gave us the lunch menu when we walked in, then after sitting there for 20 minutes they told us the price would increase because it's dinner portions now; which is kind of fishy and just plain wrong.  If you ran a business and made that mistake you'd have to own up to it.  Unless of course your desperate and that difference in $3 per plate makes a difference.  They also lost power, which was strange because the music was still playing, but all of the lights when out and the flood lights kicked in.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because they were very nice people and the food came out HOT.  Like I'm talking burn your entire mouth hot if you weren't careful and I for one like that in a restaurant.  They also comp'd my friends Pepsi due to the power being out.",
