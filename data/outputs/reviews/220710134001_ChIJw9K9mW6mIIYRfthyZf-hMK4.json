The Manger Tabitha was amazing very nice and respectful to all the costumers including myself. My smoothie was so good as well she made it very fast didn't have to wait long at all. Definitely will be going back before I leave to go home while I stay at the Hilton for vacation.",

The girl told me to come back in 15 or 20 minutes that she was on break. This was around 5:30 in the afternoon.  Not sure they would even been open much longer if I had waited not that I would. She obviously was not by herself because she was talking to someone.  Not sure why they can not take care of there customers first and take there breaks when no one is waiting to be served.",
