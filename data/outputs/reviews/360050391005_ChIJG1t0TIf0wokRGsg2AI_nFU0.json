I have been living in Nyc for several years and this is the only italian restaurant that transports me home. I tried almost everything in the menu (specials included) and everytime I find all the food OUTSTANDING. The quality of the ingredients is superb and the preparation of the dishes is better than so many downtown restaurants. You want a spectacular meal, this is the place.  The staff is polite, attentive and doesn't rash you out! In the pics arancine, eggplant parm, octopus, and chocolate cake.",

I have been in the restaurant business for 25+ years & traveled the USA. This was by far the worst restaurant experience I have had in several years and most definitely the worst in NYC.

So, five stars for Fiasco is perfectly appropriate because it was excellent in every way.  My fiancee and her friend and I hit up Arthur Ave just about 10 pm on a Friday night in June... And bistro after bistro was closed or closing. We were wondering what options we might have aside from bar food at Howl at the Moon when we saw the OPEN sign at Fiasco. It wasn't a mistake: they were open till 11.  I could rave about the service and food but suffice to say they were all great, and not just because they were one off the only places open. We really lucked out that many other places were shutting down otherwise we might have missed this experience.  The ambience is relaxing, the decor is just the right atmosphere, and the food... So delicious. If I go back to Little Italy in the Bronx, I'd hit this place again without hesitation and without trying any of the other restaurants. Truly an excellent experience.",

Was really friendly and was able to accommodate 14 of us upon arrival, the place was half empty, so that was not an inconvenience. The Shrimp Scampi was really good. The pizza was not what I was expecting, when I read the sign 'brick wood stove,' for some reason I thought of Adrienne's Pizza.  The bad experience came when I started to see auras - which usually are the beginning of a migraine - and I waived at the waiter assigned to our table whom was already taking our orders and when he approached I  asked him \"I know you are only half way, but can you please bring me an espresso, because I'm about to get a migraine and if it is triggered it will give me a really bad headache.\" That's when he told me \"You have to wait until I finish taking the orders, we do things ORGANIZED HERE.\" Had I been there with just my family we would have stood up and left -considering all the option of dinning available in the area - but I decided to brush it off and waived at the headwaiter whom very kindly brought me the espresso. I drank the caffeine shot and 10 minutes later I was feeling better.  Because I don't like to have hard feelings with anyone, especially with people preparing my food and drinks, I told the waiter assigned to our table when he reached me to take my order, \"I want to apologized for trying to rush you with the espresso, but if I didn't get it on time, I would have gotten a killer headache\" and his respond was \"You should walk around with your medicine, so when something like this happens you can just take it\" , that's when I realized this guy was either new to the job, or simply didn't like us, so I just smiled and said, \"You are right.\"  The headwaiter came back 30 minutes later and asked me if I was feeling better, I said \"Back to normal, thank you\"  A note to the waiter serving our table: it doesn't matter if you're serving whites, blacks or browns, at the end of the day, in the inside, we are all GREEN.",

The Chicken Francese was notably good though not memorable. The service was attentive though not more than expected. If someone said we'll eat here again, I would certainly not say no. But I would try to explore somewhere else first.  Pros: Serves food until 11 where most places shut at 10, so for later food on Arthur, this would be my recommendation.  Cons: 4 TVs right there upon you while dining. Sports are great, but not while enjoying a family meal.",

Ordered the Ziti with vodka sauce the taste was far from the taste of fresh pasta in an Italian restaurant in little italy.  I truly beleive that attention to details is what separates the passionate chef/cooks from the novice. The bread that was given was not at least warm, the house salad was cut so bad that I had to cut it again to smaller pieces. See pic that I posted.  The cook didn't even peel off the sticker form the tomato. The dressing was 90% reg oil not even olive oil was used 10% vinegar. As the saying says you only get one chance to make a good impression.  Won't be returning again. There are to many other better choices.",

        "caption": "So. One hot Summer night, I pulled my Subaru Impreza into the parking spot directly in front of Arthur Ave Fiasco Restaurant. Now, I don\u2019t I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the fact that I\u2019m 8 months pregnant, the parking spot was on the left side of street, I was late for dinner.. whatever.. I could not seem to get close enough to the curb to satisfy the intense parallel parking rules of NYC. I backed in and out, in and out.. people were obviously looking at me, staring, judging. After 10 grueling minutes perhaps - I was frustrated. So I said to myself  \u2018 ya know what - I don\u2019t care. This is fine.\u2019 I got out of the car to inspect my mediocre parking job, and out comes an angel of a waiter from Fiasco\u2019s. He says \u201c Can I help you park, I don\u2019t want you to get a ticket.\u201d I looked at him surprised. To find this level of kindness on the streets of NYC is like a myth- too good to be true even! To be completely transparent \u2013 I most likely owe twice as much on my car loan as the car is worth; so someone stealing the car would probably be more helpful than harmful at this point. I said okay, thinking I have nothing to lose. The man effortlessly adjusted my car with only one or two turns of the wheel. He got out of the car, handed me the keys, and told me he hoped people had helped his wife more when she was pregnant. Anyway, I just wanted to write this review, because although I was not a patron of Fiascos I still received the most heartwarming and wonderful customer service from his restaurant than I have ever experienced anywhere else. Owner of Fiasco \u2013 this man deserves a raise. His name started with an A.. I don\u2019t want to guess in case I get it wrong. Moral of the story- I still have faith in humanity. Thanks Arthur Ave Fiasco!",

There is no dessert menu because they said the pastry chef makes different, fresh desserts, and they give you what's available verbally. New York cheesecake was tasty, the strawberries and raspberry sauce was just sweet enough. The warm chocolate cake was ok, but the accompanying gelatto was delicious. Tiramisu was the best we had tried before. We got all this for under $100, so were quite happy when the bill came around.",
