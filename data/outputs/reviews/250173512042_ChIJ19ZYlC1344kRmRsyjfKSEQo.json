It was still delicious and my husband pointed it out it was probably a South American fusion. We got the humida and root vegetable empanadas and they were ok, got them frozen and brought them home to reheat, price was great.  When I\u2019ve had them in person in bow market I enjoyed them more fresh! The pebre was not traditional which I was sad about, but still had a ton of flavor. Chimichurri sauce delicious! Worth the try for sure, would love to try their version of the completo if they add a veggie hot dog to the menu!  I\u2019m also 100% for supporting small local business right now so am glad to have tried it, hope they survive the pandemic!",
