I\u2019m not trying to sabotage your business, but reviews are there  tell your customers experiences and if by chance it\u2019s not want you wanted to here, one will reach out to try and addressed the issues.Maybe  you didn\u2019t had time to step back to notice what was going on.",

        "caption": "The only reason I gave one star is because the gentleman that was trying to accommodate us was very nice and one of my companions said the fish taco was good. Other than that...  1. There was no social distancing being adhered to. When you first walk in it looks like it as they have partitions up between some tables. Which was the case between our table and the one across from ours. HOWEVER as their party increased from the initial 2 to 6, the waitress picked up the partition and practically had it ON our table as close as she placed it. She didn't even have the respect to ask us if we would like to move to another table or if we were OK with the partition being moved closer to us. We made it clear that it was unacceptable and another staff member told her to put it back where it was. Problem solved, right? WRONG!! The group then increased even more and now they were at 10 people. This tie a male staff member came and REMOVED THE PARTITION COMPLETELY!!! He didn't even look in our direction. FYI... the manager/owner stood at the top of the steps and watched(allowed/approved) this to be done. They were so close to our table that someone just entering could have presumed we were all together!!  Needless to say that did not sit well with myself or my 2 companions and we asked to be seated in the front patio. AGAIN, this courtesy was not extended to us, we had to ask!!  I guess our comfort and safety was irrelevant as there were only 3 of us and 10-11 people at the other table. Clearly it was about the bigger tab!  2. We ordered 2 appetizers before the first seating incident. There was about a 30min time lapse by the time we moved outside and we only received one of the appetizers. (we canceled the other after all of the nonsense)  3. Then the drinks!! Why was there PLASTIC in one of our drinks?? When we brought it to our server's attention, her response was \"My bad.\" WHAT?!?! No professionalism whatsoever! Then she proceeded to say \"Oh, I know what that is. That's from the bottle the ingredients are kept in. We cover them with plastic to prevent flies from getting on the bottle. Why would you think that was acceptable to say? She  then looked at my companion that had gotten the plastic in her mouth with a blank stare like \"OK, so now what?\"  After the awkward 5 sec pause, she says \"You want me to make another?\" Ummm...NO!! THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT!! The manager/owner never even came over to discuss why we moved our seat...to apologize for the plastic in the drink...NOTHING!!  Needless to say, we will not be returning. We LOVED the original place when it was on Flatbush Ave., so we were really looking forward to this visit. Very disappointed!!  In repsonse to the owner's reply, the partition was NOT MOVED BY THE CUSTOMERS. IT WAS MOVED BY STAFF TO ACCOMMODATE THE LARGER PARTY WITH NO REGARD FOR OUR TABLE! AGAIN, I WATCHED THE MANAGER AS SHE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS OVERSEEING THIS. So what is there to advise of when she was watching? However I will call as requested. Thank you.",
