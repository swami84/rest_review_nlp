I got the quesadilla, which doesn't come with any sides, sadly, but after eating the nachos I didn't need it that much.

There was nothing exceptional about my tacos. But I must say, the nachos was really good (a few came with my tacos). But I didn't care for the green salsa to much.

There was plenty of space inside to maintain social distancing.  There were only 4 tables inside. Since my buddy and I sat inside, there were quite a few people coming in for pickup.  Due to the times, you order at the counter and you sit down. We ordered the guacamole and chips 1st which was very fresh. The chips were thicker than I prefer but they were fresh and does not break when you scoop! Also ordered the pozole soup, which was some pieces of chicken with the thick corn in a low spice broths. It was perfect for the chilled rainy day. My buddy ordered the steak fajita while I got the chicken poblano which was a nice size portion and they both came with rice and either black beans or refried beans. We also got 3 soft fresh tacos. I also tried the non alcohol sangria that reminded me of malta.  The food was very fresh and a welcome addition to the neighborhood since I cannot think of an authentic Mexican place in the area.",
