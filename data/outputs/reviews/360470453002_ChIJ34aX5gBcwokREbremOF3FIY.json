Really loved how they prepared the dessert as well as the sides. We walked away very full and content. We really enjoyed all the different flavors, the kind service, and atmosphere. We will be back to try more from the menu! Thank you!",

Small menu but they do practically everything well. I don't I've ever ordered anything \"meh\" from here and I've dined here about 20 times in the past five years. Repeat foodie customer: says it all. I get the hand rolls (one of each: ebi, spicy scallop, and spicy tuna) every time I go. The soy sauce flight they offer is an awesome touch and essential to the meal. I drown my Temaki (hand rolls) in the spicy sauce. I like their sushi bombs but usually I will get one of their specials - the main menu itself has been updated many times. They offer things like fried chicken and turkey leg randomly. This restaurant really hits the spot. It's not luxurious (because someone will complain about the benches and proximity to other diners during peak hours - it's not that bad, or just go during off hours if you're bothered by that sort of thing) but the service is usually superb and you will get a solid meal here. Good place to take a first date if you are feeling nervous and want to break the ice, but not very romantic. Not a place to bring your kids but most places in Bushwick aren't... Yeah, this place is definitely good. I looked over my own review and now I'm hungry!",

We had chicken shoyu ramen, pork mazemen and uni mazemen, phili roll (salmon and tofu cream cheese) karaage and handmade gyoza.  Mazemen were pretty decent but do not get the shoyu ramen. The broth is a bit salty and it just taste like boiled water with soy sauce and slight brothy taste to it. I'm not sure how other ramen are but broth is the life of ramen. And if it's it's anything similar, I would advise against getting it and recommend getting mazemen instead.  The Phili roll had a weird texture to it. Maybe it was the tofu cream cheese but it had this mushy feel to it that made it a bit weird to chew. Gyoza was not bad but nothing to praise about either.",

You can find outstanding fish on the menu, simple vegetarian options and also really exotic japanese dishes and grill. My absolute favorite is \"seafood mazemen\",  along with \"spicy tuna handroll\" and a veggie sushi \"roll\" that is made out of tofu skins and filled with goodness. :)  I think restroom needs some work, but I feel like lots of the restaurants in Bushwick need that. I'm not thinking fancy, but maybe not half broken and wet and filled up with fake soaps in \"fancy\" packing.",

The service is very fast. You can\u2019t go wrong with $4 sapporos also. I usually get guacamole tuna or salmon that are really delicious. They are small sized but really melt in your mouth, also the cilantro adds something special to it. The only downside that I personally find annoying is that the place is cash only so I had to get money out of my bank just to come here.",

Oddly, I think the round shape definitely makes it more appeasing to eat. They provide you with 3 types of sauces that I had fun trying. The sushi bombs can also be found at their sister restaurant, Bozu. If you come to either of these restaurants you must try them! Service wasn't that great...  Spicy Mc Bomb ($7)- 5/5 This one is my favorite sushi bomb out of all of them. The katafi makes such a huge difference- it adds such great texture and gives it a crunch.  Guacamole Tuna- ($8)-4/5 This was pretty small... 6 small little pieces and some that seem to have nonexistent avocado/guacamole? Anyways, it did taste pretty good. The flavor sort of reminds me of tacos but with tuna.  Handmade Vegan Gyoza ($9)-3/5 These were pretty to look at and that's about it. The taste was very average, and definitely not worth $9. It came with some sauces on the side as well.  Ebi ($6)-4/5 This wasn't too memorable, but I remember tasting the cashew. Still pretty good though. It's also quite pricey for a hand roll.  Spicy Tuna ($5)- 4/5 Again, this was another hand roll, and also not that memorable. However, it's still good, but pricey.  Oyako ($9)- 3/5 Very average sushi with roasted salmon, quite \"boring\" compared to other places. And extremely pricey for the portion..",

The food actually turned out to be pretty good I ordered the Japanese fried chicken we had an order of tempura vegetables, soup, curry noodles.  The waitress was very very patient with our party because we were very undecided about what we wanted to order and it took several attempts of her having to explain what each dish consisted of.

Little that I know that what one gets, for $17, is a small piece of fish (smallish appetizer sized, about 3-4 ounces) on a bed of lettuce. Yes, it was fairly tasty, but it should have been described as an appetizer, and not as a \"fish dish\", and cost half the cost (I did have plenty chances to try this dish on the West Coast, so I know how it should be). The rest of the menu items were also on a smaller size, and we did get somewhat different items than ordered.  In any case, after spending over $60 on lunch for two people, we ended up going elsewhere to get more food as we were still hungry. Compared with far more satisfied Japanese food experience in multiple places in the East Village, this place was extremely disappointing.",

The long community bench style seating is still there thankfully. However, the food is just okay. The sushis didnt taste that fresh and they really oversell their Sakses- only the sparkling $13 bottles are worth it- the most expensive one we turned out to be the worst one, tasting like a bad version of gin instead of nice sweet rice wine. The best dishes were surprisingly the ones that had pork- esp the Pork ramen. Some of the staff was top class but some were indifferent and tepid. Overall, seemed the establishment sold its soul and has become just another run-of-the-mill sushi place in New York.",

Phil's presence gives the outstanding food a human quality, compared to restaurants in the 2-block radius that are so mechanistic (you know who you are).  Anyway, back to Momo - such a superb sushi restaurant, I just can't eat regular sushi anymore. Everything from the diverse and bountiful menu options, to the quality of fish, and best of all, the service. Phil's team of servers are veterans, and most have been there since it opened. It's a true neighborhood spot, that know and love its locals, and care to give tourists and city-goers a taste of the local feel.  As such, it's always a good vibe, especially when Phil is there chatting everyone up. Good people, just absolutely good people there, so be nice to them, and tip them well!",

The bombs are decent, nothing special; but they're very expensive for no apparent reason. 7 -8 $ for 3 pieces the size of a water bottle cap. The sushi rolls are plain and very small for triple the price of any normal sushi restaurant. We ordered the karrage( fried chicken ) and it was very disappointing. Chicken tastes like it was a week old, hard and dry, without much flavor. You pay for a hipster atmosphere with a dark room with extremely loud music, a community styled seating.

No it is not ok to use canned tuna fish to make a spicy tuna handroll. (I swear that is true. Canned tuna in $6.50 hand roll)  No cilantro DOES NOT go well with raw fish becasue raw cilantro has a very strong flavor and dominates the palette.  If you want good sushi overall then pass this place by. If you want to bask in the pseudo-fashonista world that of the uber superficial hipster then try it. I for one like good food.

It's basically a half scoop of rice with the roll built on top- yes it's da bomb!- go for the party bomb platter ($19). But that's not all- their whole menu shines. Best on the menu include: pork Betty, tofu salad, kinpira, karaage, and seasonal tempura! Also, all of their specials are fresh and delicious. #1 rule when coming here: share everything!!! #2 rule: bring cash.",

Its awesome to see people with passion in what they do and mr. Gilmour oozes it.  His staff was all very knowledgeable and friendly as well.  I was pleasantly surprised when I called to make reservations that the only way to make a reservation was to sign up for the tasting menu starting at $65 a head.  For being in New York, having tasted what we did, compared to other tasting restaurants I've been to, the price is reasonable. With the tasting menu, they cater to your appetite and your pallet making the most of the $65 tasting whether your looking to get more full or to taste some more refined and yes smaller plates.   We enjoyed dishes ranging from pickled vegetables to fried prawns flown in live from Alaska.  Apparently Thursday nights are the best as they are always receiving shipments of a variety of fresh new product from all over the world.  I will definitely be back again!",
