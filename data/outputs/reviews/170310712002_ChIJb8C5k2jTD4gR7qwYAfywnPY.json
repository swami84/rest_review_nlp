And the people are so friendly! I usually don't bother to write reviews but what really seemed special about this restaurant was the people working there. It was lovely to see how the receptionist greeted me\u2014he beamed a huge, genuine, welcoming smile and waved at me from a distance. You only get to see that kind of \"I'm so happy to see you\" smile on the face of an old friend, but he just seems to have that kind of friendly personality. And it was heart-warming to see how the receptionist, waiter/owner and waitress, and the cooks interacted with each other, like a family. I can feel their passion for their small business. I always like people who are passionate about what they do, so I decided to write a review to root for them. And of course, what matters, after all, is the quality of the food. Today was my second visit. A friend who grew up in Xi'an brought me over on my first visit and mentioned that this restaurant had the most authentic and delicious Xi'an food in Chicago in his opinion. I've been to Xi'an in the past and have tried all three Xi'an restaurants in Chicago. I agree. The food is outstanding. Combination Noodles and Cold Rice Noodle are outstanding\u2014the former is heavier, and the later is lighter, so I'd recommend starting from the lighter one if you decide to order both. The Beef Paomo is also very delicious (and they have sweet garlic to go with it). The Pork Burger (rou jia mo) is the only one I found underwhelming because the meat is a bit too lean/dry to my taste and is missing green pepper (okay, I welcome debate on whether having green pepper in rou jia mo is authentic or not; I think it's more flavorful). I remember last time I had the ground beef pancake (shao bing) which was crazily delicious. Sad it seemed like it was sold out on my second visit. And oh, it's an open kitchen so you get to see how they prepare the food. The food was served very quickly because there weren't that many tables. I both wish they can get more customers on a Sunday evening (because they deserve it) and also selfishly wonder whether I'd be able to get a table and fast service if everyone comes here. :)",

On a previous visit, we had tried the Xian Style Crepe w/ beef, the combination noodles, and the hot and sour dumpling soup. I think the only thing I could kinda complain about was the the beef in the crepe was a tad bit over cooked, but aside from that the food flavors and taste were great. Loved the noodles and the dumplings. Price point won't break the wallet. Seating is just a handful of tables (mostly 2 or 4 seaters). Service is quick and no fuss. Easy street parking ($2/hr).  I see many future visits here in the future when I'm too lazy to drive down to Chinatown. I dig it for the noodles and dumpling soup. Why you still here? Go, go, go.  'Til next time!",

This region of China has a heavy emphasis more bread and noodles instead of rice. We got the pork burger, hot and spicy wonton soup, and combination noodles with pulled pork. Everything was really good, I definitely recommend coming with friends and sharing.",

The place is setup like a quick turnaround eatery that resembles a Chipotle-ish environment, except they do have table service. Food came quickly and the staff were very friendly. It was not crowded at 6pm on a warm winter Thursday night but did get quite some traffic around 6:30-7pm. We were too deeply concentrated on the delicious veggie crepes and spicy dumplings, pork filled bun and beef brisket soup to take any pictures. One advice- make sure you eat the beef brisket soup right away as the bun cubes tend to soak everything up if you don\u2019t. Enjoy!",
