The waffle was probably the only dish that didn't really impress. Wait staff was fun and gave us a shot of mezcal to finish off the night. Overall a great tasting menu, definitely one that I would recommend.",

The food was obviously amazing, but I was surprised how much fun it was at the same time.  I didn\u2019t know exactly what to expect, this being my first experience at a Michelin starred restaurant. However it felt completely comfortable and laid-back from the moment we entered and they asked my first name.  The service was excellent, with different people bringing out different dishes. I\u2019m pretty sure the servers were also cooks. Seemed like everyone was involved with both the front and back of house experience, which is something I had not seen before. Every course we had was imaginative, tasty and most of all fun. Will be back next time we are in town for sure!",

The atmosphere is akin to walking into a stuffy house. For the $150 plate, I expected better service or at least a finer experience. Unfortunately there are a lot of restaurants in Chicago that get a lot of play without being legitimately worth the spend, here being one of them. The servers quickly set dishes down and we could barely hear the description with the blaring music. Tables were so tightly set up that it made for uncomfortably close quarters. Music was good but too loud. Lighting was wayyy too dark. Food was, by Chicago\u2019s high standards, just alright. It was just plated nicely. I don\u2019t get the hype about this place. If it\u2019s supposed to mimic a pretentious/exclusive NYC hole in the wall fine dining type of thing (if that is a \u201cthing\u201d), it worked. It\u2019s not fun. Oh and one of the servers def took a smoke break in the middle of his shift and absolutely wreaked.",

Servers were attentive and friendly. They tended to rattle off the dish ingredients very quickly and without a menu it wasn't easy to pick up on each dish's composition. The music was fine, especially if you like hip hop from the 90s. Some of the dishes were quite good - the mackerel stood out and crispy mustard greens with ham broth as well - but many courses had flavors that clashed seemingly just to clash. The bigger issue was the level of salt in at least half of the dishes. I get that higher end places don't skimp on the extra salt, but this was overdone and really distracted from some of the flavors. At that price level it's pretty disappointing.",

I left so full I thought I would burst, and had to slouch in the cab on the way home to be comfortable. :) It's a fixed menu, 12 courses I believe, but they were trying out new dishes so we had even more than that. It's not an uppity environment, they play rap music in the kitchen. It's byob too which is really great for a restaurant like this. One tip - bring a bottle or some beer for the chefs. I wish we would have known that before we went! I hope we'll go back sometime!",
