I generally hate writing reviews, especially bad ones, when I'm not local. Local flavors, tastes, and traditions sometimes just don't match your pallet.  But.... I experienced Porgie for the first time and loved it.  The serving was just right (heaven help me if I find out it is healthy). It was on top of a delectable mix of white sauce, potatoes, mushrooms, and pasta? ( seemed like Spaetzel to me) The flavor combinations were just heavenly, and the price matched a regular restuarant (no New York sticker shock).  I had heard that veggies and meat would be bland and expensive in the big apple. Maybe they are, but not here.  Just a tip, I went with the Porter against my better judgement (I hedged on the fish being bad). Definitely, go with a white wine and let the dinner do the talking.  Only regret was the heavy fish smell, but then two other people ordered the same, so I could enjoy the flavor in peace.  I can say, with all the accolades that up and comers like Portland, Seattle, San Francisco, are earning. Maybe New York food has some tricks left up their sleeves. I hope everywhere I eat on my holiday is half as good.",

Including hands down, as of 10/2017 the best burger I've ever had. Shocking I know, that an unassuming new American hipster place in Bed-Stuy would win this award but trust me here. Also major props for the decor, it's truly wonderful. Other winners include the Salt Cod Fritters and the Brussel Sprouts. Only downside is the beers area bit pricey but whatever, just come here for the food. Ok, the dessert is coming.  Edit:, the dessert blew my loafers off. Changes daily and only one option available, today it was the banana bread thing. Wow.",

I have a thing about finding spots with great biscuits and eggs, so I just ordered those things, and I was not disappointed. Food took a second to arrive, well worth it, drinks were much faster and delicious, we ordered bloody Mary's and the drink special, the \"island life,\" which featured Ginger and Thai basil--so tasty. Overall, I'm so so so glad I finally visited this spot--it was all I hoped it would be.",

Not sure if there was too much dressing - it didn't compliment the kale. Not sure if almonds complimented the dish either, maybe walnuts. Kind frankly it could have just been the apple and cheese. Green apples are natural alittle sour so it kind of throws off the subconscious freshness you except for a salad. Also as a friendly suggestion, thin slices of cheese may work better than cubes.",

My boyfriend had the wings and a salad (that we can't remember unfortunately, but he loved both), and a delicious cucumber (also neon-colored) mocktail.  The waitress and owner couldn't have been sweeter, coming over and welcoming us to the neighborhood.  A great time, definitely a treat, but we would be back every week if we could spend the money.  Highly recommended.",
