The set includes 4 appetizers, 14 ways/flavors of Shabu Shabu, a bowl of soba and dessert for $150 per person.  There are only 2 time slots available from Tue to Sunday and they serve only 2 groups (5 people maximum) each slot. The reservation should be made on Yelp with credit card.  The chef and the staff were friendly and sweet. It was an amazing dining experience and all the food was prepared in one bite size so customers can eat easily and elegantly.  The food was delicious with no doubt, especially the quality of Wagyu Beef. All flavors were delicate and various from sweet, sour to spicy. The arrangement of each dish is reasonable and balanced. Our favorite was the Sukiyaki, which was perfect with a pouch egg & sauce.",

Since it was private dinning and the seating before ours had cancelled, it ended up like the restaurant opened just for us.  Chef Mayumon was very nice and friendly.   The A5 Wagyu from Miyazaki was melt in your mouth tender, and perfectly cooked.  The washugyu had more beefy flavours which is great as well.  (Personally, I prefer washugyu.).   Each bite was cooked with care, and the sauces all paired very well with the different bites.  The chef was very attentive.which made the meal even more enjoyable.  Overall, it was a great experience, and we will definitely visit again",

I went on a Tuesday for dinner and found at I was the only one who reserved for the day as Tuesdays were slow days for the place, so I had the full attention of Chef Mayu throughout the delicious Shabu Shabu course. To clarify, Macoron's omakase trends more towards Japanese style and flavors, while Mayumon features a larger focus on the taste of meat and fusion flavors.  First off, the venue has a long bar-table area upon  which food is served, brightly lit enough to accentuate the classy atmosphere and complimented by decidedly jazzy background music. Chef Mayu was friendly and receptive to both welcome me and answer any questions I has about the course/ingredients, doing both the cooking and serving of drinks herself.  Then comes the food, which as mentioned before, was nothing short of uniquely spectacular. The tasting menu features a curious mix of western inspired Japanese dishes executed to great effect, with the bagna cauda appetizer standing out to me for its rich umami flavor balanced out by the bright and juicy vegetables to dip into it.  The meats themselves were a good mix of highly marbled A4 Miyazaki beef, pork belly and flavorful Washugyu beef, with the choice of A4 being a purposeful choice as A5's fat content would not translate optimally to Mayu's unique Shabu Shabu preparation and accompanying sauces. I in particular was surprised by the use of blue cheese, basil sauce, fig sauce and balsamic vinegar on one of the beef pieces, as it was a combination of cultures and flavors that I was not expecting, but was delighted to find worked perfectly together. As I was the sole patron for the night, the whole course took just under an hour or so to complete, with the pacing of the meal coming at just the right intervals to allows for proper consumption and appreciation of the food without feeling too rushed or neglected. Props to Chef Mayu for that.  Overall, the ~128usd sans tax tasting menu was more than enough food for me to leave feeling full and satisfied. Of note is that Chef Mayu told me that sometimes people get too full towards the end of the course that they forego the soba noodles and kakigori shaved ice, so there's no need to worry about not leaving satiated. I'm definitely planning to come again and bring others along with me as Chef Mayu is thinking about changing up the menu since the restaurnts launch in May of 2019, and wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone looking to venture out of the ever popular sushi omakase and try out something new.",
