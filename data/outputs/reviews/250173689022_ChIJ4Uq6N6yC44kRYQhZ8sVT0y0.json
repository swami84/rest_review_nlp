Thick, hearty, loaded with tree fungus (mushrooms) and other traditional vegetables, it has a little kick to it but isn\u2019t so spicy that I can\u2019t enjoy it.  I happen to like mine with a good bit of the sour flavor, so I sometimes add a dash of rice vinegar when I get it home.  It was my \u201cgo to\u201d on a cold winter evening.  This isn\u2019t a place you\u2019d think of trying based on curb appeal...there isn\u2019t any.  I decided to try it because I  drove by anyway and I was still on my quest for the perfect H & S soup.  I enjoyed the beef with green beans but it wasn\u2019t memorable.  I tried the fried rice once and it disappointed.  Take the food home...the interior is dreary. But it has an open kitchen so I can see that it looks clean.  And very budget friendly.",

Asia Wok clearly lies to make excuses as to why they take so long with delivery (most likely because they wait for several orders to stockpile up for delivery runs) and then have the nerve to yell and blame you for it. Asia Wok is a bunch of sneaky schemers. I will still order when drunk at 1am but I won't be happy about it.",

When I called Asia Wok to see why I received bean sprouts instead of chicken chow mein, they told me that American chow mein is not a noodle dish, and that what I got was not a mistake. This is just not true. Chow mein is indeed a noodle dish, and is not what I was given. This weird change to a very common and standard dish is not mentioned at all on their website. This is not even mentioning the fact that it took an hour and a half for my food to be delivered to a location that is not at all far away from the restaurant.

Much better, in my opinion.  As far as entrees go, I haven't been too adventurous: chicken & broccoli, chicken w/cashews, moo shu X.  Not a fan of the last two: celery does _not_ go with cashew chicken, and the moo shu has a bland, slightly bitter taste.  The chicken with broccoli is always good, however, as are the dumplings.  Asia Wok isn't going to beat places in Chinatown, but it's my favorite \"late-night\" Chinese in the Waltham/Watertown/West Newton area.  Way better than Hon Dynasty, Dragon Chef, or Tiki House.",

        "caption": "Worst service ever. I'm a vegeterian and ordered a SEAFOOD chowfoon for delivery. However, I received a BEEF chowfoon and told them that they made a mistake with the order. They first told me that they never had SEAFOOD chowfoon. Then suddenly they said they did have seafood chowfoon and told ME to come to their restaurant to switch. So I began yelling at them how they are not making any sense for making a mistake and not caring much about it. They said they would make seafood chowfoon for SWITCH and $2 extra charge. I waited 2 hours and called them 10 times. They kept avoiding my call. Ridiculous service, and I plan to actually sue them if my food does not come any soon.  They were very nice in the past, but now they are just terrible.",
