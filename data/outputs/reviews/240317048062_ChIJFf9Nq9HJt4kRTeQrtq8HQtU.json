I have patronized this establishment and its other locations, even in Fort Lauderdale, Florida which recently opened. And it is THE REAL DEAL and TASTES AMAZING since I have patronized them since 2007!  Note: I AM CUBAN! Transplant from Miami and can tell you Cubano's fare is ALWAYS as Cuban food should taste PERFECTLY SAVORY!!!  Whoever is complaining about flavor must be seeking Thai or Mexican foods and most likely hasn't travelled much, and certainly is clueless about our national cuisine.  Allow me to educate the clueless... Cuban food, and most Latin-American food also, by the way, is NOT SPICY.  Trust a genuine Cuban when I tell you this is as the MOST AUTHENTIC and BEST-TASTING CUBAN FOOD outside of my own kitchen!!  Not only the food, but the AMBIANCE, the waiters, the owners, the hosts, are all the most attentive, genuine, friendly, caring, people I have ever found in any establishment nearby.  If you want cheap, salty, over-priced fare, as the charge seems to be leveled here, I suggest walking across the street to bask in salt, corn, and meat buried under spices so you can't tell its age.  Something about a Ranch.  So go spend your thirty dollars per person to eat industrial warehouse bagged chips and canned dip. But please, don't insult quality cooking.  Everything at Cubano's is FRESH, and DELICIOUS....I do agree, prices are a tad steep for Cuban fare. But this being our area where they corner the market....don't even bother going to the nightmare Cuban place on Rockville Pike, forgot the name....and address luckily.  Don't listen to me, or the ones trying to diminish the real quality and service you will find at Cubano's.",

        "caption": "So this is a combination review from me and the wife. She grew up in Key West and ate Cubano sandwiches her entire life (Sandy's Cafe). She introduced me to cubanos 10 years ago and I have gone S far as to smuggle them back to the DMV. So when we hear about a Cuban restaurant we must look into it.  So during the Cov-ID quarantine we discovered they Cubanos Restaurant was doing limited hours of carry out. My wife went in and placed the order I stood outside. I looked in the window and felt the atmosphere looked like it belonged in Key West or Cuba so point for them. The Cubanos were $16 a piece (ouch) we must take a point away.  The pork was slow roasted and delicious if a bit bland deducting 1/2 point for that.  Pickles not sour enough and need to be a little thicker. Deducting 1/4 point for that.  The mustard was not tart enough and  I think the wrong type was used.  We have to take 1/4 point  Even though the bread was not actual Cuban bread, it was well toasted and soft while hearty enough to hold the sandwich together. Point there  The chips were very good. Freshly made and tasty. That's a point.  My final grade: B- My wifes' grade: B+  Final assessment Solid B.  A little pricey but good food.",
