So I got my order even faster without ubereats, and since it took so long he apologized (even though it wasn't his fault) and offered me 3 free soups (i ordered food for 3 people). very generous and kind and really knows how to treat the customer. 100% will be ordering from here again as my go to sushi place!",

The crunch in the sushi was so weird and unappetizing. They used rice crispies for \"crunch\". Like what the hell? Not only was it weird, the crunch was large making it difficult to enjoy the sushi and it got soft with the sushi. Then when in took it apart to see inside the crunch, I realized they stuff about a third of each roll with the crunch so you really weren't getting as much of the fish. I really wanted to enjoy it but I just couldn't. Won't be ordering from here again.",
