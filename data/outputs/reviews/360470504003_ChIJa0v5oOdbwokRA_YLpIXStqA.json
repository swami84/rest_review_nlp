        "caption": "This cute new place does indeed serve up Bangkok street cart style Thai food. I lived in Bangkok for a year, so I can attest to this.  We had a pineapple friend rice, masaman curry and pad Thai. All had a great flavor and fresh ingredients. Also had an shrimp satay appetizer\u2014amazing sauce!  The owner , \u201cBrook\u201d showed me his life story, drawn as a comic on the wall by the register. I\u2019m pretty sure it was his mom or other elder relative cooking in the back. Very sweet.  Comfortingly for a small place, it seems built for social distancing, with no seats and most of the small space given to the kitchen.  We will definitely be ordering from them again for pick up. Not sure if they have delivery yet.",
