The shrimp Alfredo pasta I ordered turned out to be slightly undercooked and the Alfredo sauce was just terrible.They charge you $5 more dollars for shrimp which I found hilarious because they only put six. Overall the food was just terrible. If you are a pasta lover like myself, then this is not the place for you. If I could put zero stars I would.",
