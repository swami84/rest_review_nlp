I highly recommend our server, JP. He is conversational, funny, and delivers excellent service. I have a hard time not ordering my favorite dish: Rigatoni alla Buttera.

My parents tried to explain that they have been consuming the food and drinks the entire time and that I was also going to consume, but the manager wouldn't have it. This was absurd! Never have I heard of a restaurant borderline kicking out guests over a 2 hour dinner service! Ceasar made it clear that this establishment prioritizes quantity of customers rather than quality of service - no really, he said it himself. To top it all off, we were going to return the next night for dinner with friends (a bigger party and more money) but clearly this has been cancelled.

We even had our names on the list, and stepped into Riccardo for drinks and Antipasti while we waited the 2 hour wait across the street.  Our appetizer was the best calamari of my entire life.  It was grilled with some char, and melt-in-your-mouth with lots of flavor.  We decided to stay for our entire meal, and I'm glad we did.  The pork chop was amazing. The chocolate molten lava cake was not too sweet, absolutely perfect.  You couldn't beat their customer service or atmosphere.  This should be a major culinary destination.",

I was nervous, but the dish (and everything else) was delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The wine was outstanding too.   All of these things are fairly easy to find in a Chicago restaurant.  What sets Riccardo Enoteca apart was the service.  Everyone from the host to the waiters, even those serving other tables, were remarkable.  Very welcoming, very on-point, not too intrusive, and utter gentlemen.  I will no longer dread making the trek to Braun's for my cat's meds because I now have Riccardo Enoteca to look forward to as a treat for myself.",
