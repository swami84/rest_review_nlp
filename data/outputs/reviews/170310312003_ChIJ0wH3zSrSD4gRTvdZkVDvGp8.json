        "caption": "I came in accompanied by my group and I had asked for my pho bowl with the onions separate due to a mental health condition. When the waiter came to take my group\u2019s order I had specifically told her to have it separated and the waiter jokingly said in a translation to English \u201c you have to remove them yourself\u201d. I was already in a bad mood that day and I wanted to come to the restaurant I haven\u2019t been to in weeks. The way the waitress  discouraged me in front of everyone that knew my condition was insulting. I didn\u2019t laugh initially, but my face and presence showed I was not remotely joking. I\u2019m hundred percent sure that the waiter knew this and still choose to continue taking orders without an apology. My appetite was disgustingly ruined. I now have a hard time looking at the dish I\u2019ve come to love in my culture and now can never forget that moment now so that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this review. I believe the next insulting part that followed was...I never got the dam onions or scallions on the side. It was so bland to have it without it and I was having a bad day so I just ate the pho as fast as I could and left the group since someone already volunteered to pay. When the waiter came I asked about why I didn\u2019t have the onion or scallions on the side and she said she thought I didn\u2019t want them when I clearly instructed her to have it on the side before she made that horrific joke.mi stormed out the building in anger and went home. I honestly hoped that restaurant was gonna help me, but I can\u2019t help but feel a pain in my chest and a tear to my eyes every time I think back to the moment where the waiter made a mean joke and still disregarded my easy instructions. My departure should\u2019ve been a sign for the waiter to realize what happened, but of course it\u2019s not. The reason why my review rating is a 2/5 is because I still want to believe in the restaurant I\u2019ve come to enjoy, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve visited so many times and loved the dishes. I don\u2019t review often, but I felt like I needed to get this off my chest. I hope the owners can tell their staff to be careful about what they say because you don\u2019t know if your joke can impact someone you don\u2019t know who may be having a bad time. I honestly want to go back to talk to the waiter and the owner, but my fears and depression makes me lose heart every time I pass the restaurant. It\u2019s a sinking feeling I can never let go even when I recently visited another pho restaurant (pho5lua), the waiter saw I wasn\u2019t enjoying the pho and talked to me about it. I truly feel that I can never enjoy a good pho meal anymore because of that experience, and I hope my review will help people tell the waiter or manager of my experience because my heart isn\u2019t strong enough.",

This place in particular is probably the best pho I\u2019ve had in Chicago. The broth is hearty and tasty. I usually order pho with everything in it including; tripe, tendons, beef, meat balls, and what I love most about it is that they give you a cervical spinal cord attached with meat still. That is authentic af.  One thing I will say is that I usually order egg rolls as an appetizer and they aren\u2019t really consistent with it. The egg rolls are frozen and they just deep fry them as preparation. Which means, your egg rolls aren\u2019t always as hot. I\u2019ve had times where I\u2019ve bitten into it and there\u2019s still small shards of ice in it. Its not really a big deal tho because your server will just send it back and make you another. Other than that, when it is perfectly fried, it\u2019s amazing.  There is free WiFi as well and the atmosphere is good. No complaints. Just sit, eat, and enjoy the pho!",

That was what I did and I couldn't be more wrong about the place. The food was good, the vegetables were good, the prices could be better, and the portions were good. The place is very tiny as well  My only real complaint about the place was that my waiter ended up forgetting about two of my orders--an entree that had apparently been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be put out along with a smoothie. As soon as I had informed him about my smoothie, he replied with a, \"Oh, yes. Your smoothie..it's coming right now\" and I kid you not a few seconds later I hear the blender revving up.

There's usually at least three bus boys for a smaller restaurant but it seems so mismanaged. Tables are half cleaned, food comes out at an illogical pace and expect to wait a bit anytime you ask them for something.",

My tongue and lips turned beat red, it wasn't just hot it was excruciating pain. My heart started racing, my nose wouldn't stop running, I got a bad headache, I was sweating like crazy.. I was actually worried I might have to go to the ER. That was a habanero pepper, nothing else could have caused that. That was NOT mentioned in the description, or any pepper even.
