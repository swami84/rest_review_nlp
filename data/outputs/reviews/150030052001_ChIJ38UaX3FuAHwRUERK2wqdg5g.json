There was a store that advised me to bring in alcohol, so I searched for a nearby store and bought alcohol.  \u2606 order Shrimp and pork? Roast beef salad  Both are delicious. The problem is something of shrimp and pork? If you asked, it was no juice. Because you can't eat so much for so, you can't ask for a soup with herbs in a separate dish.
