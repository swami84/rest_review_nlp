It was unnecessary and made us feel unwelcome and we took our business to a very lovely pub down the street. I expected better from Sonoma.",

We then showed her a screenshot of our reservation and she said \u201comg sorry I didn\u2019t see it\u201d. We saw it was happy hour, and we asked our waiter about the specials. He told us happy hour was at the upstairs bar and that we could go up whenever we wanted, so we went up to get drinks and came back down to our table. Keep in mind that many servers saw us bring our drinks downstairs. This next sentence entails the worst moment. The second time we tried going upstairs, our waiter stopped us dead in our tracks and said you are not allowed to bring drinks from upstairs down here. We were scolded in front of everyone.

The food was good and the service was excellent, but the communication with the event coordinator, Hilary, was very difficult, which made it kind of a sour experience. We had about 50-60 people from out of town who were all planning to meet us Friday night after the dinner, and they have the perfect lounge area for everyone to mingle and have drinks. We opted not to formally reserve the area so that people could open individual tabs since you have to pay the tab on one bill to reserve the area. Hilary assured us that we could grab any available space after dinner at 8:30 PM. Her exact words in writing were \"If you want guests to pay for their drinks individually, then I won't reserve the space in advance, and your group can just come over to the bar after your dinner and grab whatever couches or high tops in the room happen to be available.\" However, when everyone starting arriving, they immediately close down the lounge and tell us we have to go to the downstairs bar. It was very embarrassing since all my out of town guests were standing around in a dark lounge. It was only 8:30PM, and we had 50 people ready to spend money in the lounge on overpriced drinks. So, we moved downstairs and had to stand at a crowded bar around other people having dinner. We gave them so much business that night, and all we really got was. \"Sorry for the miscommunication.\" It was very disappointing on a very special night. I just wish she had told us there was a chance of it closing, so we could have planned an after party at a better location with better service (like Hawk N Dove).",

It was most definitely salad! And the medium burger arrived dry and charred. I sent it back. When my order arrived the second time, it was still so wrong. There was no salad and burger toppings actually looked like burger toppings. A vast difference from the first time. But I specifically requested that even though I didn\u2019t want a bun that I still wanted the special aioli. There was none! The burger was kind of medium, but still charred on the outside. There were fries, but about half of them weren\u2019t cooked. Seriously, they crunched! Disgusting. I called them back. They gave me the name and email of the manager. I emailed her and absolutely no reaponse. I may have forgiven this fiasco as a one time event if I\u2019d actually received an email. But nothing. Do not recommend ever.",

We went ahead with a charcuterie board of manchego & 1 other cheese and the duck prosciutto & prosciutto do Parma. The board was delicious however the bread that comes with the board is lacking something... either their focaccia needs to be grilled longer or brushed with garlic/EVOO to give it flavor. The charcuterie was delicious and was served with a nice amount of prosciutto di Parma and thinly sliced pieces of the duck prosciutto which melted in you mouth.  For main my friend got the spaghetti vongole & I had the mint papardelle with lamb Ragu. The mint papardelle were definitely interesting and had an enjoyable taste. My friends vongole had just the amount of clam broth at the bottom helping the pasta to not dry out & remaining flavorful.  If you\u2019re visiting for dinner and are sensitive to cold I\u2019d suggest to get seated farther inside as the restaurant did get a little cold but that\u2019s just expected of winter time!",

Liked the ambiance 4/5  Server:  Terrible. It was my expectation at a wine bar that the service staff should know about wine and be willing, maybe even feel directed (!) toward helping explain the wine program and the various offerings.  I ordered a pre-designed flight as my server was mostly missing.  The server lined the flights up on the table and proceeded to walk away without telling us which wine was which.  I had to call him back and ask him, only for him to go back to the bar to find out.  The server also brought my partner's salad before the wine (another, maybe unreasonable, expectation of mine).  After we finished, the table was bussed and the server basically threw the dessert menu on our table without saying anything.  Only because we received what we ordered: 1/5.  I've been given more thoughtful service by my Doordash delivery person.  Food:  Good. Nothing special.  Octopus, broccoli, wedge salad and burger were good. 3/5  Wine:  Good.  Nothing special.  I only found out after we ordered that servers could help us create flights.  I found the flight to be mediocre.  3/5  Overall:  A restaurant that bills itself as a wine bar should have a staff that is knowledgeable and engaging.  That was not apparent here, in fact, it was the opposite.  I even felt like I shouldn't be sitting at the table.  That's not my expectation of good service.  If you want to go to a wine bar, go to Cork.  Both of my experiences there were outstanding.",

The upstairs is set up like a lounge with plenty of couches and chairs to sit at.  I cannot speak for their food, but they had great wine selections. We asked our server what he recommended and we both took him up on his suggestions. It was a home run! We loved our wine choices (I had their gewurztraminer).

The second floor lounge, which is chic and enjoyable, features $5 glasses of red and white wine. I ordered a three-item sampler plate (olives, fried calamari, bruschetta) for $9 and was delighted at the sizable platter of eats I received. I'll be back soon! (Visited 4/15/14)",

I love that they have normal portion sizes (I believe they refer to them as appetizer sized), which helps to make it more affordable and somewhere I like to go to more since you don't end up with a ton of food you can't eat. I'm a big fan of the amish chicken with pasta. And their wine selection -- fabulous. Reservations defintiely are recommended. I haven't been disappointed here though yet. Perfect ambiance.",
