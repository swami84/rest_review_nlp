I've been to Ken Kee several times over the past few years and what keeps us coming back is the overall cleanliness and decent quality food for prices that won't break the bank. From the variety of noodles, veggies, soups and entrees to choose from, just about everything is delicious! MSG ya say? Probably / most likely. But note they do a good job of keeping the tea and water filled.  They also have quite the selection of tea, smoothies, and boba as I've noticed. Anyways, I wouldn't say it's a go to option every time or one of my top recommended spots in Chinatown, but it's a nice change up every now and then. Only thing I would not recommend here is the salt and pepper tofu. Our order came out pretty soggy and unappetizing to eat. Other than that, no other complaints.  'Til next time!",

I ordered a beef brisket noodle soup, and that thing was so tasty it got me sweating! When they brought out the noodle, my mouth got flooded with saliva! The smell was spread all around our table, and I was so excited to see it!(i was super hungry) I also had another dish called fried tofu, it was so good! The sweetness is perfect! Not too sweet, or salty, it was perfectly blended. I finished the entire plate myself, even though i was supposed to share the food with my family \ud83d\ude02. The place may be small with only a few tables, and you might have to wait a little. But everything, including the wait is worth it! I wish I can go there everyday just to try out every single food on their menu! Seriously, that's how good the place is.",

It was extremely busy at 11pm with a very diverse clientele, so I was compelled to try it. I was not disappointed at all. The interior was bright and clean. They did not have a large staff for the amount of patrons in the restaurant, but service didn't suffer at all (we were in no rush). We enjoyed water and tea while we checked out the huge menu (great vegetarian options). Looking around the restaurant, everyone's food looked delicious with large portions, and ours was no exception. I loved the Curry Noodles w/Veggies, and am regretting not bringing an order home. Kid-friendly! My picky eater enjoyed the steamed rice and the staff was extremely accommodating and patient (reheating it up to his desired temperature) They also validate parking for the $2 lot just across from the square and library. Plus!",

I know it was a bit rude of us not leaving a tip but I don't like putting tips on my card cause it takes longer to reflect on my bank statement.  We were already out the door when one of the workers stepped outside the resturant  and forced us to tip her. Later on I'm looking at my bank statement and turns out they charged me the whole total  or our meal and half of the total .

My mom and brother were in town and wanted to grab a light dinner so we decided to try out Ken Kee - it did not disappoint! The place was pretty packed when we arrived, but luckily we came right when a table was finished.  Here's what we got:  FRIED PORK CHOPS This is one of those dishes that's pretty standard in Chinatown, but Ken Kee's were some of the best I've had. They were hot, juicy and so good! The spiciness from the chili peppers gave it an extra kick.  SALT AND PEPPER SMELT I don't know why it took me so long to discover this dish!! It's probably because I'm so desensitized from heads and tails, but boy am I glad we ordered this dish! They were hot and salty -- almost like eating french fries, but so much better! Definitely a MUST!  BABY CLAMS IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE I LOVE Ken Kee's clam dish. Hands down some of the best I've ever had in Chinatown. You gotta get it. The sauce was hearty, rich and the clams were plump and tasted super fresh compared to other places. Can't wait to get this again. NOM.  The portions are pretty generous and we had leftovers to take home. I'll definitely be back!",

UNFORTUNATELY, it was closed due to some kitchen upgrade and we were so hungry we decided to try a new Chinese restaurant.  We randomly chose this restaurant.  The tea was good, our appetizers were pretty good (CRAB RANGOON) although the service was bad, our server pretty much ignored us the whole time, which, i just shrugged off thinking it was a Chinese tradition, to kinda just back off the customer and only attend to him, when i made eye contact and signal him.  not a big deal, im not a huge fan of annoying servers, chatting you up for a tip anyway.  we shared the orange chicken entree, as well as the mixed (chicken, pork) fried rice.  the orange chicken, wasnt THAT great, but did have an authentic taste too it.  the rice was good, i liked the pieces of pork in it, so i found myself, digging through the rice to pick out all the pork meat pieces.  after i finally made eye contact with the waiter, i was able to waive him down and pay.  WE HAD LEFTOVERS, so when we asked for a box, he took to the plates to the back and boxed and bagged it for us.  when my girlfriend was eating the leftover rice, she found a HUGE THICK BLACK CURLY HAIR, the length of my index finger! it looked like an armpit hair!  i know for a FACT, that , that hair was NOT in the rice before i asked for a few boxes.  Im 100% sure, he put that hair on purpose!, either me and or my gf would of noticed that long huge hair if it was there on the plate the whole time, we pretty much, inspected the whole plate of rice, as we were eating it.  THIS PLACE IS DIRTY ! DO NOT EAT HERE!",
