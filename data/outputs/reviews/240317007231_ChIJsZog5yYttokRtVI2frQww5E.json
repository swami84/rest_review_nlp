While this place offers dine-in option, it's mostly popular for take-out orders and if you're ordering only one dish, then it usually takes them just 10-15 mins to prepare it; hence, the word \"express\" in their name. First time, I ordered a mysore masala dosa, but I received masala dosa. The dosa was bigger than what I expected, but not enough sambar or coconut chutney to go with it. Second time, I ordered a vegetable biryani and again, the quantity was a lot more than I expected. Bottom-line: It is not the best tasting Indian food, but it is good for getting a quick fix. They prepare the food right in front of you, so that's a plus.",

This is an express take out eatery, not a decorated eat in restaurant, but there are a couple of tables if you want to eat in. I chose & recommend the take out experience. I ordered their Kadai with bread and their butter chicken with rice. Quite frankly words can not express how delicious & fresh this food tasted.  I can tell you that it was very rich in flavor and beats even restaurants I have visited in bigger cities such as NYC, Philly, etc. I was moved to call the owners & leave this review immediately after. No take out has ever driven me to review so quickly! All I can say is, you must try it to believe me! Thank you Minerva Express Indian Cuisine for a memorable authentic meal!\u201d \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f",
