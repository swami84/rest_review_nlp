The staff are great, friendly, welcoming and are more than happy to offer a few recommendations just in case you're feeling indecisive or totally clueless on what to choose.  This restaurant is in a prime location,  near the Barclay Convention Center so it's a good option after a concert,  event or day of shopping.

Everything was freshly prepared, from the homemade fruit juices to the appetizers to the main course. But I guess all that comes at a cost, everything took so dam long to come out. Literally got there at 9 and didn\u2019t leave until 12, the chef really takes their sweet little time back there in the kitchen. The service wasn\u2019t the best either, I mean I know it\u2019s Caribbean restaurant but all the attitude can be saved for the behind the counter take out spots, not at an actual sit down restaurant. The prices seemed a little high in my opinion and they automatically add gratuity. Definitely might only be good for takeout.",

Service was prompt and useful, without being in your face. There wasn't a lot of vocal explanation of the dishes, but I felt the menu descriptions were good.

We were asked if we would be kind enough to change seats to accomodate a party of 12. We didn't see a problem with it so we did. But once we moved and the party of 12 came in, we were totally ignored. We had to call out to the waitress who acted like someone else was supposed to be serving us. We got our food long after we had moved. I was very upset at the service but tried to move past it since we had our food. then the bill came. the bill was $49.07.....I gave the waitress $20 cash and my card to charge the rest. She charged my card $39.07.......when i pointed out the error and she went to fix it she came back with a bill of $51.06  stating that there were items  (which we never had) that she forgot to add......When I brought it to the attention of the manager, he finally charged me the right price Which was a dollar more than the original bill because they had put a wrong item.  I checked my account yesterday and realized that these people charged my card 3 times for each of the bills they brought me. I will be in there on Tuesday evening to get ALL my money back. This was my worst dining experience ever.  Will Never ever return there for dinner.",
