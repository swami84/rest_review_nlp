The very best dirty martinis by far and if you are a bourbon drinker (or not but want to be) just ask Louie or India to make one for you. Unbelievable, I didn't even like bourbon before I started coming here. Place is amazing, 3 generations here almost every night. This is the original Charlie Gittos and in my opinion the best because of the history.  7/10/20 update.  The thought of Charlie Gitto never being at the corner of the bar with his heater running brings a tears to my eyes. What a great guy and touched so many. Great owners set their businesses up for success just as he did. As I sit here tonight eating one of the best dishes of tortellini I have ever eaten here, I know that the tradition of this restaurant will continue and grow.  Louie Vangel has done an amazing job of training the new cooks and this is my second meal this month that has blown me away with the improvements. Top it off with an India Farrance cocktail \ud83c\udf78 and you just can\u2019t get a better combination. For those of you that know me get it, I do come here all the time, but I\u2019m telling you, the food has never been better in the last four years than it has my last two visits. But that\u2019s what great owners do. You will be missed Charlie and never forgotten.",

Salad was drenched in italian dressing.  All in all it was ok, but not likely to go back.",

We waited until 30 min passed and then we were seated at one of the 12+ tables that we saw open. Annoying but okay, we heard the food was good so we were optimistic. Ordered ravioli app not great but edible. Our entrees completely lacked any flavor at all, way over cooked chicken and bland pasta sauces. Server was nice but never refilled our drinks or asked if we wanted another beer. I would never recommend this place to anyone, it really was one of the worst Italian restaurants I have ever been to. Super bummed we went here, if you visit St. Louis find a different Italian restaurant!",

I got the Caesar salad and the toasted ravioli appetizer. The salad was good but the raviolis were gross. They were toasted perfectly but the meat inside reminded me of cat food in a can. It was a weird texture and a weird taste so I wouldn\u2019t recommend ordering them. They carry a vanilla flavored light beer called love gun from a local brewery and it\u2019s pretty tasty.

The pictures on the wall are great and the owner is almost always at the bar in front to greet you as well. They have a full bar and a good assortment of wine as well.

By the time they took it back, removed the cup of red sauce & wiped off the dish where it had dripped & returned it to me, it had totally cooled. It's an appetizer but I used it for my lunch with a salad. The salad was good. I'll be back to St Louis periodically but will be eating on the hill, Cunetto's in the future.",

The soup was VERY oversalted. I like well seasoned soup but this was too salty to enjoy. Also, I ordered the chicken parm as my main dinner entree.  Chicken parm is always best when served in thin cutlets. Charlie Gitto's prepares a huge chunk 'o chicken breast, too thick to qualify as a typical chicken cutlet. It's simply understood that the best chicken parm involves thin filet cutlets of the breast, gently fried and covered in marinara sauce and MOZZARELLA. I must have missed the part on the menu stating that some other cheese would be used... Was it provel cheese? It was slimy rather than dense and stretchy. But above all, what really bothered me was that the pasta served under the chicken was cool and not hot.  I love Italian food... I seek it whenever I travel to STL for business. Unfortunately, this meal was not enjoyable. No need to come back here with so many better options available.",

Literally like eating copy paper. The kids wouldn\u2019t eat the cheese pizza.... and cheese pizza is hard to mess up. My entree was super salty and I\u2019m a person who always salts my food.

Add to that the rest of the decor and the music playing in the background and you feel like you've stepped back into the 1940's. It's a great place to have downtown as it's a nice balance of casual and elegant.  We've been going there for years, and have had some up and down experiences.   One time we got their deep fried cheese and it was cold.  We sent it back and when it came out again it was still cold.   Other times we've had nice meals with no problems.  The food itself is decent but the prices have steadily gone up over the years which makes me expect a bit more but really nothing has changed that I have seen.   This probably makes us go less than we normally would.  Still there's something that I like about this place and want to see it stick around.  Check out it if you want a unique slice of St. Louis history.",

I had the Chicken Marsala: the chicken itself was fine; the sauce, while flavorful, was too thick; the green beans were limp and the roasted potatoes could have been cooked a good bit longer. My lunch companion expressed a similar opinion. It's possible that dinner entrees suffered from competition with the lunch crowd. I'll have to try a lunch entree next time.",
