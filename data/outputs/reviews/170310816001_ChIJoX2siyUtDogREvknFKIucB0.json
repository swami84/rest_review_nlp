I hope they find their footing to be the destination they could be, but I doubt I will be returning.",

However there were a few things that left me confused during brunch time last Sunday:  - no choice of fresh squeezed juices, - no iced tea whatsoever (meaning no Arnold Palmer option for a drink) - two choices of hot tea, which didn't include black tea (only green and chamomile). Afterwards we found out it cost $7 for one cup of it (wasn't offered any extra water) without any \"embellishments\" that could make it worth it - just regular Bigelow tea bag in a mug, without honey, lemon or anything else that could justify the price - no egg on a avocado toast, which was just dry - also fried plaintains as a side were bland and hard to even bite  I very much enjoyed their French toast with berries, citrus salad and Run Vanilla sauce. That was the best part of the whole experience, even though I had to order it because I couldn't enjoy their steak and egg. That just wasn't my cup of tea.  Seems like this place more suitable for those who prefer to drink alcohol during brunch time. \"Create your own cocktail\" I'm sure pleases well that kind of crowd.",

The food was good and amazing dessert but the service could of made up for it to have a better dining experience. The restaurant wasn\u2019t too busy and our table wasn\u2019t fully cleared before dessert was brought out - dirty knifes, drink glasses, bits of food and menus all stayed on the table and weren\u2019t cleaned up (even after I moved everything to one end of the table) at all even after the dessert plate was taken away. The restaurant was pretty empty and the staff seemed more content on hanging out in the back versus cleaning up.",

So many vegetarian options and it's very dietary-restriction-friendly (I have a gluten allergy and everything except the fried mushrooms and seafood fritters is gluten free! When does that happen!?).  The staff is super knowledgeable with questions about the food, as well, which I always appreciate.  The decor is amazing (even the bathrooms!), and even though (I think) it's a tiny bit on the expensive side, it's worth every penny.  I think the pineapple old fashioned is my favorite drink that I've had so far, but the choose-your-own-adventure cocktail situation is great, too. You can tell they use super fresh ingredients and none of the drinks have ever been super/overly sweet.  There are a few larger booths that would be great for groups, and a bunch of bar seating (with really comfy chairs!) that would be great for a date. If you're in the area and looking for something a little different, I couldn't recommend this place more!",

The only thing that was missing was a bread basket so I could soak up the remaining sauce. It is really that good. Elote cakes were great. The Tamarind-glazed turkey wing was absolutely delicious. The  jerk pork shank was so tender and ripe with flavor I would highly recommend.  The service was spectacular as well. Overall, highly, highly recommend Flora Fauna.

The turmeric added a lot of spice to an otherwise fruity drink.  My girlfriend and I shared the lamb tartare, elote corn cakes, and butternut squash for our main meal. All were delicious, though the lamb tartare was easily our favorite. The green apple slices added a nice hint of citrus to complement the meat.  We ended the meal on the banana split, which was also a knockout. The mint leaves were an interesting addition but definitely meshed well with the horchata ice cream. Be forewarned: we took it upon ourselves to finish the dish, but this was definitely meant for at least 4 people.  Overall I loved my meal here and will be sure to return!",
