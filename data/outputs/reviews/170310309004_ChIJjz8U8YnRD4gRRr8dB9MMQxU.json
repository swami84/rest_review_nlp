Albeit, it's Detroit style and delicious but I believe if I had the same slice in the Motor City itself, it would have not been as good. It's not that Fat Chris makes a thick crust, mucho sauce, ample cheese with fresh toppings...It's good because it's made in Cook County. When I'm up that far North, I'm grabbing another pie.",

But seriously, get make sure you get the Detroit style. It's so much better than their round, I don't even know why they make a round. It's the best I've had since moving to Chicago about six years ago. And yes, that includes Jet's. I like Jet's. But I like this better.  ---  Pretty disappointing. I'm new to the neighborhood and saw someone recommend Fat Chris's on Nextdoor. The photos reminded me of Buddy's back in the Detroit area. I ordered it for lunch.  The good news is it showed up early. The bad news is their online ordering is a train wreck. Every individual permutation of pizza size and type has its own listing, and none of them tell you what's actually on the pizza. In fact there are no descriptions at all. What's a 10\" Samoa? A 14\" Carnie? A Big Chris? Who knows! So what I wound up ordering (on accident) was a Domino's-quality medium round pizza with some boneless wings that were probably microwaved (no crunch at all), and a \"Caesar salad\" that was just a bowl of lettuce and cheese with with some underwhelming dressing.  I might give them another shot and make sure I get actual Detroit-style pizza, because there aren't many options for that in the area, but this initial offer doesn't inspire confidence.  tl;dr: expected Buddy's, got Domino's.",

I was disappointed with the end result. Visually, the pizza appeared a bit shallow for the Detroit pan variety. The flavor profile was bland. Pizza sauce was sweet and tasted like tomato paste with a little bit of added water and no seasoning. Another thing that struck me as odd was that it was served on a round tray too small for the pizza. It is clearly baked in a square pan and a permanent part of the menu. Are square serving trays hard to come by? Jets is better. The search continues.",

The chubbie was the best part and by itself would get 4 stars. The sticks were good, but I'd like more garlic on them. The pizza is where it fell apart for me. Overall it just didn't have any flavor or wow moments. The dough had a good crust on it with just the right crunch and flavor. However, when I bit into it, the dough just crushed too easily. It didn't have enough structure for me. The cheese was ok. The toppings just didn't have a lot of flavor and wasn't fresh. Pizza was hot but the toppings seemed cooler. And lastly the sauce just tasted like canned sauce with a flat flavor. There was no savoriness or herbs to it and it was balanced on the sweetness and acidic side.",

We ordered both boneless and bone in and they were both very soggy, undercooked but not (raw undercooked). Wings should be very crispy, and the regular wings seemed like they were never crispy in the first place. Even baking them for 30 minutes didn't crisp either up. The sauce was also pretty  bland, they don't need to be insanely spicy but there should be a kick. Also for carryout and delivery orders wing sauce should be standard on the side to keep.them as crispy as possible.",

Honestly wasn't expecting much based on photos from a friend on Facebook, with a big roll of brown paper towels on the table, but gotta say I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a no frills place....you order at the counter, it's BOYB and there are brown paper towels on the table (the kind you see in a bathroom dispenser).  That aside, the food is pretty good.  We ordered the Detroit style pizza, Chubbies (Pepperoni Rolls) and a Pizza Turnover.  Gotta say that when I saw Chubbies on the menu, the first thing that came to mind was something of a sexual nature, then mini pizza rolls.  Wrong on both accounts.  The Chubbies were actually big ass rolls filled with meat and cheese, covered in garlic.   We got the 6 to an order and only ate three between the 3 of us.  The pizza was very good as well.  We got \"The Goods\", Detroit style (cheese, red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, black olives, and banana peppers).  For those you who don't know what that is, the pizza has a crust that is extra thick, yet super-crispy on the bottom. And it is square shaped.  In the days when I got this in the Motor City, these pizzas were cooked in industrial metal square pans that were used to hold metal parts.  Not sure if they are doing this here, but Fat Chris has gotten the crust right.  The crust is chewy and crunchy at the same time. Also the sauce is on the top and  I love it!  The turnover was nice too...I didn't get it but had a taste of my daughter's.  She got pepperoni and brisket.  I love the fact that Fat Chris let's you pick your toppings for the turnover.  Next time, I think I will get one with brisket, green peppers and onions.  Noticed that there were quite a few delivery guys in the joint, so I am thinking that they are going to make their business on take out.  Also wanted to point out they they do a lunch buffet...not sure if it is every day or Mon-Fri, but it is $11 (all you can eat pizza, salad and fountain drink), kids 6-11 are $6 and 5 and under eat free.  We had plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  They have desserts but didn't get to try those....next time. Also please get some real paper napkins.  Next time I will be bringing my own.",
