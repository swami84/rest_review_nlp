Don\u2019t ask her (one with glasses) for help, cause she will give you an impression that she is either annoyed or frustrated. However, the server lady was great. But she was not able to make up for the rudeness we got from the hostess.  Secondly, portion of food. I do not blame them for being expensive because I understand that things are expensive due to their location. But what we got was very laughably crazy small portion of food. We ordered 2 orders of regular and 2 orders of marinated Galbi at first, and ordered 2 more Regular. The dish, which supposedly contain 2 dish orders of Galbi, literally had 10 slices of Galbi. It was very obvious that number of slices were nowhere close to what we had before. We did not even have to count the actual number, because just the way it looked was way too small. What the server said was that their company makes very keen job on weighing the meat. So basically she was saying that slices were thicker than before. Well... we couldn\u2019t tell the difference in thickness from before. But she said so... so we did not argue too much on that.  Anyway, as a fellow korean, I would love to give 5 stars as long as service and the taste are somewhere close to average, but I do not think I would recommend this place to any of my friends after what we had.",

It is located on the second floor of the Waikiki Resort Hotel, which apparently is owned by Korean Airlines. Our tour guide had called them before our arrival so we were immediately seated at two 4-top tables (we were a group of 8 for dinner). Stew was already cooking on the burners on the table and servers soon brought out rice bowls and four side dishes. We had a vinegar cucumber/seaweed side dish, sliced radish, kimchi, and beansprouts.  I get that a lot of older Korean people may not like to try new foods or just want to eat a nice Korean dinner after eating Western food all day, but I felt like this was a waste of a meal that could have been spent eating local Hawaiian fare. And if you are not Korean, there is definitely no reason to come here because the food isn't even good. While I am biased against most Korean restaurants because my mum is such a good cook, Korean restaurants in LA are far better than this. (Granted, that shouldn't count since LA also has the highest population of Koreans in a city after Seoul.) I found the stew to be just mediocre and thought the same of the side dishes. Not much to say about the rice. I really just ate because (1) it's \"free\" (included in our tour cost) and (2) I was hungry and I had no other options.  The service was just okay. Our servers were fast in the beginning to bring out everything, but then we never saw them again except for when someone at our table would yell for service (where are the table button thingies I'm so used to seeing at Korean places?!). I can't comment on the cost since our tour guide took care of it, but I don't think whatever the price was would be worth it for such mediocre Korean food. This review isn't completely fair since I didn't even get to see a menu and they might have better food offerings, but I guess we'll never know...",

If accompanied by a child, please order an adult. Young people tend to ignore words. I went to the restaurant today and just got hurt.
