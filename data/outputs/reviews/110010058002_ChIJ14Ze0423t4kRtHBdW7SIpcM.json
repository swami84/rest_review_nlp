Pad thai is my usual favorite but it comes in 3rd, not because it was anything less than great but because everything else was a smidge better. Also recommend the chiangmai curry lomain and the spicy salmon sushi rolls. Basically everything was perfect. The wait staff was perfect. The service was fast enough. We could ask for food to be made more or less spicy based on what we wanted. I couldn't expect anything better. If I had to nitpick I'd say that the ambience is good but not great. For the price, 100% worth it.",

We also ordered one of the pricier spider rolls and it wasn't any better. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating and hopefully the quality of the food will improve as they come back from COVID.",

The bowl are HUGE so you get a lot of food for a pretty decent price averaging about $12 per bowl (sushi is a bit more expensive). The staff here are also amazing; I waited 8 whole minutes before my meal was right in front of me (honestly quickest service I've had in DC, I love it). There are plenty of vegetarian options (a little limited on the vegan options), but there is a lot of variety in the food, so plant based people won't be stuck with the usual eggplant Parmesan or other stereotypical vegetarian option. There is a four spice option that comes with the meal with an awesome selection to really customize your dish (use a small amount of the oil with the chili flakes in it and it will really jazz up your meal without overpowering your palette with spice... but only a small amount... seriously). Overall it was a very convenient restaurant for a Tuesday night dinner.",

The place was mostly empty when we entered except for one lady who had arrived before we got there. As we were taking our seats, another gentleman entered and took a seat. We were greeted by the waitress and ordered one spicy salmon roll and one spicy tuna roll. We regularly order sushi, so we are familiar with how long it usually takes for an order like this to come out. That being said, the lady was soon served her food which gave us no alarm. About twenty minutes later, the gentleman was served his food. Both of their orders were more elaborate than two sushi rolls. We hadn\u2019t received any update on our order, so I asked the waitress about how much longer it would take. She said it was coming out soon. Around when the gentleman was served his food, two other patrons had sat down. Another twenty minutes pass, and these two patrons are now eating their respective orders. By this point, I had asked the waitress a couple more times on the status of the sushi rolls and she relayed the same message: it was coming out soon. I\u2019ve ordered sushi dozens of times at restaurants and not once has an order with two sushi rolls taken close to an hour to prepare - especially during business lunch hours when other customers were receiving more labor intensive selections at a much quicker pace. Needless to say, we were the only black patrons there and got the point. What confirmed my suspicion of racial discrimination is that when we told the manager that we couldn\u2019t stay longer because the request was taking too long and we had to get back to work, she offered no apology or explanation. She didn\u2019t even address me. She simply shouted in another language toward the back and walked off. So we walked out and will never be back again.",

It wasn't super super busy either time I've been there, but the waitress (place seems to have a small staff of regulars) was super quick with serving us and always refilled our water without us having to ask, even when waiting the 5 other tables on her own. Prices are reasonable for portion sizes, $12 will get you most any of the noodle dishes on the menu. They also let me charge my phone while I ate in one of the few wall outlets.",

And since my brother in law really wanted sushi, we added the Godzilla roll - worst decision ever - it carried a strange foul, fishy aftertaste. We threw it out after half of a bite.  The service was extremely slow even though there was only one additional occupied table. 45 minutes just for two bowls of noodles and a roll of sushi? Furthermore, we felt ignored and forgotten in the corner after we placed and paid for our order.  Again, another Asian food fail in DC.",

Absolute Noodle hooked us up with $40 for $20, so I checked it out. The bowls are huge, the food is fantastic and the service was spot on. You know what I appreciated the most? They didn't treat us any differently because we had the deal. Too many places put these things out there and then treat you like crap because you actually come in and use them.  The BBQ pork spare ribs fell off the bone. Delicious. We all tried different bowl combinations and all of them were great.  I'll definitely be back with the wife next time we're in the Chinatown area.",
