I wasn't prepared for how overwhelming, crowded and expensive other restaurants were, ($12 for a grilled cheese sandwich) or their \"cash only\" policies. I was so glad to come across Monty's. The prices were not outrageous like some of the other places around. The interior was calm, clean, and beautiful with helpful and kind servers (Dusty may have been his name?) that were not going in for the \"hard sell\" like most of the people we encountered that day as we were walking around. Monty's was truly a calm in the storm and a little bit of familiarity mixed with an authentic New Orleans experience. The food was amazing! I had the crawfish mac and cheese, my friend had some gumbo and we took home some bread pudding. The only tiny things that bothered me was the sweet tea was lemon flavored and the windows had no type of shades to block the harsh direct sunlight from beaming in on us. It's definitely a place I will plan to visit again! Thank you for not being \"cash only\" lol",

However, the waiter didn't take my gluten intolerance concerns seriously even though I directly stated I would get sick if I eat gluten. He made no suggestions other than yes, I can order eggs but was unwilling to verify info for me. He offered several sides and I chose potatoes and asked if they were plain as I was concerned about gluten hidden in seasonings and the waiter stated yes. When the food came the potatoes were deep fried (I can only assume there isn't a dedicated fryer some this was never stated). I pushed the potatoes to the side. I was hungry ate the omlett and ended up not getting sick but feel that intolerances and allergies are not taken seriously at this restaurant and for that reason wouldn't return. There are many other options in this city that take concerns seriously and have excellent food. Sad because I think the food is good. I was here last year and had beignet fries and those were good too (before I learned I have Celiac).",

It was flavorful I guess, but not what you might expect from southern cooking. The shrimp Po-boy was definitely lacking something...maybe some more seasoning or sauce?

I debated ordering their \"beignet fries\", but decided that was a bit on the nose. So I went with their brunch po' boy - French bread, bacon, fried green tomatoes, over-medium eggs, remoulade, and lettuce. And a side of cheesy grits.  The bread was toasted, but obviously from yesterday. Remoulade tasted more like mustard than anything else. Sandwich was decidedly messy to eat (who wants messy food? Not me). And the grits were pasty rather than creamy. Still, it was tasty despite the inadequacies.  And, as I said, the service was fast and friendly.",

Food came and she NEVER asked us if we needed anything or if our food was ok. Rudely threw silverware onto the bar top.

Food was good but that was the worst service I\u2019ve ever received. We tried to saw thank you to the hostess on our way out and she was looking at her phone and ignored us as well.

I had the Crab cake eggs Benedict I asked for the sauce on the side. It was such a pleasant breakfast. My mom had a crossiant with coffee. She tends to keep her breakfast small and this place had the perfect options for her and an amazing option for me. A place I'd go to every morning while visiting the French Quarter.
