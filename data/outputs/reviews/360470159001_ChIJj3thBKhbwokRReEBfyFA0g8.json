Would love to go inside one day and feel the spiritual essences of ghosts and dearly departed who haunt this building. I saw what looked to be a wedding going on, and would e a great place to have a ceremony here because the local area is quiet and calm, adds richness and class to the vibe of the area.  I found this place by pure accident. I exited the 2/3 train at Grand Army Plaza station, and was walking to meet with friends at a restaurant when I spotted the Montauk Club.

It's the sort of building that will never be built again and that should be treasured in this age of utilitarian leggo structures. I live across the street and enjoy watching wedding parties stand on the steps for photos before going inside for receptions framed by stained glass windows, afterwards smilingly fanning out to limos and cars. After some prodding by neighbors, having thought that a club with a capital \"C\" would be too stuffy for my taste, I became a member and now find my time there comfortable as a favorite pair of slippers. The service might be a bit slow on occasion, but you don't go to a place such as the Montauk Club for fast food: the fare is good, often better than good, the staff uniformly friendly, the light coming through the stained glass during a spring or summer brunch both illuminating and unbeatable for the price. Soak it up and marinate. Although at first a somewhat reluctant member, I have come to hold this place dear, as an essential and welcoming part of my love affair with Brooklyn.",

To start, the throwback setting is beautiful with the dark woodwork, stained glass windows, and gothic architecture...full of character; the opposite of the boring, sterile hall or hotel ballroom venues.  The service was wonderful--Sarah is amazing and she went above and beyond to help us not only the day of the event but every step of the way!  She helped by supplying sample floorplans and even helped me visualize by moving the tables around one evening in preparation to finalize our plans.  The bartender, Antonio, went above and beyond to accommodate our not so easy to find special craft beer requests which was greatly appreciated from two self proclaimed beer snobs, ha.  The floor captain and servers did a great job and were very accommodating.  Sanya responded timely to all of our emails and ensured our vision for the evening was carried out.  The food was amazing!  We weren't sure what to expect when we signed the contract as you cannot taste the exact food on the wedding menu, rather when you become a member of the club you can go for dinner and try various things on the menu to get a sense of the food and what is good.  While it would have been nice to try beforehand, the chef far exceeded our expectations.  We chose the pork tenderloin and the beef sirloin which was carved by the staff.  Both meats were outstanding, full of flavor and very tender.  We substituted the salad with the truffled macaroni and cheese which was the best menu decision.  It was so delicious, some of our foodie guests actually emailed the Montauk Club attempting to get the recipe!  The Chef also went above and beyond providing delicious cheese and cracker plates in the bridal suite so we wouldn't get too woozy from all of the champagne.  This was much appreciated.  The only negative of the evening was the temperature in the club once the dancing started.  Unfortunately, the air conditioning had not yet been serviced so it got pretty steamy when we were tearing up the dance floor.  There is also a noise ordinance so windows could not be opened in excess. The staff were as accommodating as possible though bringing in fans to cool us off.  All in all, I highly recommend the Montauk Club for a wedding venue.  We were extremely pleased after a most memorable evening : )",
