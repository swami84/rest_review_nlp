To which someone picked up  after I waited on hold, heard me then hung up. This is the most disrespectful and frustrating thing I can think of when trying to get things set for events. Calling back no one picks up and I have now been calling main line for 30 minutes to be assisted and again no one to answers. You would have to be crazy to work with these guys on anything important for you will receive absolutely no clarification or answers on any questions you have. I was very surprised to even see positive reviews at all. I really hope it\u2019s an isolated event, but if I can help anyone else not deal with my issue I\u2019ll be glad to steer you away and onto another location. I will update with location and name after my reservation is set with our new venue. Also to be noted, not even the central main line can reach these guys and are unwilling to even try.

He gave us a free drink because he started to make the Jack and diet Pepsi but couldn't finish when he realized no diet Pepsi.  The service was very good, and presumably they will have more options when they \"really\" open.  The rooftop area was pretty basic, as I expected from the reviews, but the views of the city were nice.  You could hear a little of the street music from Dupoint occasionally.
