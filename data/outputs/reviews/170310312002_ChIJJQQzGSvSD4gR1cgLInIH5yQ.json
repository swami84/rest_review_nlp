And it\u2019s not just about the pho, the Vietnamese savory pancakes and the salads are also outstanding. But the pho in particular is out of this world. I love beef tendon, and this only place where they do not skimp on the tendon. The portions are very large, the broth is clear and beautiful and flavorful, the noodles are fresh, I could ask this pho\u2019s hand in marriage and live happily ever after. Yeah, that good. Go see for yourself.  This week I gave tried for the first time the salted plum drink and the condensed milk egg yolk soda. Both great.  Now, I cannot really complain much about the service either; at the very least, it has always been fast, even though there have been communication issues with the waiters from time to time. Same waiting staff has been there forever. Do not be put off by the guy who looks a bit unsavory, as if he just walked in off the street and is trying to sell you something illegal or immoral. He is an old and reliable member of the staff.",

I didn't like it all and didn't bother drinking the rest of the soup. The freshness of the beef is also somewhat questionable. Underneath the top layer of pink slices of beef, I managed to find thick pieces of pre-frozen and hard to chew pieces of beef. Overall, I was rather disappointed by the pho experience. On a separate occasion, I also had a chance to try the wonton soup. Again, I did not like how the noodle tasted and the wonton soup was fell well short of my expectation of how a bowl should taste like. On the bright side, food is really cheap.",

One guy came,  I told him I wanted pho tai. He then walked away. And i just sat for another 20 min.  Then one guy finally came and asked me if anyone took care of me, I said no. (Wow.) He did apologize. He then gave me a menu and a cup of water.  I ordered a small bowl of pho ($9). Pho was ok. But guess what happened after I finished eating.... yup I sat.  Waited for them to give me a bill.  After what seemed like forever, I got up,  stood by the register. Tried to make eye contact with someone with my credit card VISIBLY in my hand.  2 guys kept walking past me.  After 5 min,  one guy came up to the register, not trying to look at me, and I just told him \"I need to pay for my bill\" Told him my table number since he looked lost.  Just wow. I was there longer than necessary and it wasn't even busy.  Location is great being connected to Tai Nam parking lot but with all the pho places steps away, you would think they would get their act together.  Will I be returning? Nope. I unnecessarily spent time and money in a place that I'll never ever get back. Just one star for the pho.",

It took 5min for a lady to finally seat me and my friend. After we were seated we weren't greeted by a server for the next 20min because they were busy conversing with other workers. At this point we haven't even received a menu, so I went up and asked for one. After we had ordered food we had a meal I couldn't help but notice something different about the soup that came with the pork dish. Usually it comes with a vegetable soup but in this case they just dumped some of the pho broth on the side. That is very upsetting since I my self am Vietnamese and had my fair share of dishes like these. Overall my experience was terrible and won't be coming back anytime soon.",

I have had Chinese food in Chinatown, Korean food in Evanston and Rogers Park, Thai food, everywhere, Sushi downtown, so far I can see why people here don't eat much Asian food, it really isn't that good here. Today that mentality changed, I actually found a place that serves decent pho, the last fortress of delicious food stood firm. Coming from Southern California where the premium ingredients and Asian genre of food stretches as far as the traffic, I really didn't want to eat Pho here in Chicago, I was flat out scared I would lose one of my favorite foods here and be doomed to eat pizza and burgers (usually yummy pizza and burgers though).  I sat down, ordered a large pho tai (pho + rare steak) and waited. I got served some tea which was a nice touch but I can see where some of the complaints are for service but then again Pho places usually aren't a place to have a guy playing violin in the background for you.  The pho arrived in a matter of minutes, the broth was clean but not boring, the meat a bit rare (which is good, you immerse them under the noodles), the noodles chewy and not stale, and the produce was fresh.  Perhaps I am being too kind on this place because it tastes a bit like home, but well if a bowl of pho can warp you back for a few precious minutes back home, I think it has done a pretty damn good job. I will be back, ready to try some of the other items they have as well.  My only squabble is that it feels like you're eating in some sort of purgatory, super clean. Not dingy like the normal pho restaurants.  The good: beef broth pho The not so good: the seafood pho",
