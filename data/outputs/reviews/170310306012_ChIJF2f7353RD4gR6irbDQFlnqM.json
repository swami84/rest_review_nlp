Thought 15 minutes ahead would be enough so that I could just pay and leave. Instead i had to wait another 15 mintues in the restuarant. Over 30 minutes for a small meal is obsurd but the fact that they were not apologetic rubbed me wrong. A huge issue is that i paid for the dinner box but got the lunch box which is a lot smaller and $2 less and only offered before 3. I didnt realuze thus until I got home. I think this was done intentionally because when I tried to get the guy's attention for more soy sauce he ignored me for a while then seemed relieved when that was all I wanted. Food is decent but customer service is trash.",

The first thing we unpacked was what was supposed to be our bubble tea because it is an iced drink. Well, the drinks were spilled everywhere it didn't even look like there was effort put into keeping our drinks contained and then THEY WERE HOT. It was NOT what we ordered! So we called to ask if the ordered could be fixed and talk about horrible customer service! The lady who answered the phone did nothing but get upset with us and argue, completely wasted phone call! So then we get to our food, we had ordered Orange Chicken, General Tso Chicken, and Kung Pao Chicken...and keep in mind we all can take a little bit of heat with no problem BUT this stuff was all so spicy that it wasn't tolerable..we couldn't even enjoy our food after all that nonsense, really?
