The broth tastes like something made by mixing condensed paste without much complexity and depth of flavors. The slice of pork is thin but not tender. It's relatively inexpensive compared to other ramen noodles in the city, if you don't demand authentic quality ramen.",

The pork felt a little incomplete in some way and the soup could have used another veggie component. Serving size was a little smaller than other ramen places around, but the price was also lower than other places nearby. I'm happy they decided on the lower price point and am fine with smaller portions to get there.",
