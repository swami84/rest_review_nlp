        "caption": "I never leave reviews but this place was divine. We came right at 5 and got to ask the server lots of questions before it got busy. The place is really intimate, clean and well-designed. It reminded me of LA. The server was super knowledgeable and made lots of good recommendations. The food was so unique and delicious. We had the pickled oysters + mezcal backs, hazelnut hummus, ricotta gnudi, and fried chicken sandwich plus lots of wine and cocktails. Everything was so good, we couldn't stop ordering. The restaurant started getting full and our server was a little distressed and dropped the wrong food at the table, but it was totally fine. He ended up taking a glass of wine and dessert off the check for us. The only downside was the dessert.. the walnut cake, I think.. just wasn't as good as everything else. I can't wait to come back. Thank you!! Also, the bathroom was amazing. :)",
