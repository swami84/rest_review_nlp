What a pleasure to find an available table on a Friday night and finally be able to experience great food in a sophisticated setting.  The Baked Brie appetizer features an apple and walnut chutney in a smooth balance that spreads beautifully on pitta chips. This tasty starter encourages conversation about the blending of flavors as one dips again and again for another bite.  Our server worked graciously and with care to answer my question about the origin of the escargot. If a restaurant dares to serve escargot at all, it is often from a can, but I learned that this is not the case here. It's been a while since I've been able to enjoy escargot, and this dish was served saut\u00e9ed with onion and sun-dried tomato. Basil and garlic and white wine butter gave it a thoroughly satisfying Mediterranean flair. Delicately arranged toast was the version of the fresh home-baked bread with distinct herbal tones.  The superb culinary execution and attentive service make Pepper Sprout an ideal destination for either a great beginning or a dreamy culmination of a romantic evening. However, it can get a bit noisy during prime hours, so for a sweet romantic time, come early or late.",

It is a high class place right on Main St, and is the perfect location for a date or anniversary, but I would reccomend calling to place a reservation or inquire if one\u2019s needed. The food is so tasty each and every time, and the chef on duty pays attention to detail so it really does come out to you in the end as a creation. The salmon is to die for (I\u2019ve had it fresh on the east/west coast and in CO so I assure you it\u2019s great).  They have wines and a sea of mixed drinks, with the perfect staff always available for all your needs. When you\u2019re ready to go they even add a special touch to your to-go container that is truly unique. If you appreciate top of the line service and meals mixed with a phenomenal experience, then this is your place. There\u2019s nothing like it in the area.",

Drove in from Cedar Rapids and paid over 60$ on dinner for 2 I usually expect to be wowed if I'm spending that much cash on dinner (we didn't get drinks)  I got the shepherds pie and my husband got the rabbit pasta... I added chicken to my dish and it was dry. Not to mention the shepherds pie sauce was extremely sweet. It was difficult to make it through the dish because the sauce, I don't think it complimented the vegetables very well.  I'm sure if I would have said something they would have made me something else but it was busy and I didn't want to inconvenience the chef..  I will return to pepper sprouts again but will make sure I understand what I'm ordering and maybe ask more questions",

        "caption": "My husband and I were in town and were looking for a fancy restaurant to eat at.  The food was good except for the extremely long blond hair I pulled out of my mouth after taking a bite of food.  It came from sweet potatos so I kept it in my mouth thinking it was just a string from the potato.  YUCK!  So I pulled it out of my mouth and immediately showed it to my server.  My server was bald, and my husband and I have very dark hair.  Turns out, it was the owners hair!  I was so grossed out but never asked for a discount or free food. I thought for sure we would have been compensated for this major mishap.  Oh no, not even a sorry from the owner.  Our server felt so bad that he bought both me and my husband desert.  Avoid at all costs...unless you like extra protein.",

        "caption": "Stopped in in May 2012, after vacationing across southern WI.  Our waitress was in such a cheery mood, I wanted to take her home with me, but my wife said no; the food was excellent, and the decor was pleasant.  The only odd thing was the crowd at the bar, which collectively did a wonderfully impersonation of the depressed & stuck-up staffers of Vogue magazine.  It was an odd thing for this country rube from Manhattan (NYC) to witness, seeing as how the town itself has a population of 17,000.  On the silver lining side, that means that every snob in town was in this one location, unable to depress everyone else in the area who's down to earth and who has a sense of humor.  Highly recommended.",
