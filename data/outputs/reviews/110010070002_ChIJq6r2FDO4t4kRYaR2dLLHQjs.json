So we ordered our food, it took a good 45 mins if not longer, we stopped looking at da time after while, so we finally got our food, I got the seafood Mac and it was THE BOMB ok like probably the best seafood Mac I\u2019ve ever had, my boyfriend got the fried chicken platter wit Mac and yams. So when he got it the outside of the chicken was a little darker than usual so he bit into a leg and it was red/ pink.. UNACCEPTABLE!!!  y\u2019all already took forever to give us our food so as long has it took you mean y\u2019all rushed the food and now it\u2019s raw??!! Ok so I notified them of the situation I was a little rude but not being disrespectful, but he could\u2019ve got sick and that\u2019s never happened to me before so the fact we drove out of town to get my uncooked was beyond me, so when I told the waitress about the situation he said \u201cgive that same energy to my manager I\u2019m just the waitress\u201d I said ok I will do that, so when the manger came over he Assured me that his meal but be free and they would remake it so there wasn\u2019t any \u201cenergy\u201d to give him cause I thought he fixed the problem, so they remade it brought us our a new meal and he started wit the leg again the you kno all the bone be darker brown on the bone, like it barley pasted the test lol, so with that piece being iffy I told him \u201copen that breast up before you eat it just to be sure\u201d and guess what? The blood was leaking out the chicken, talm bout hot??!! I tried so hard not to go off on them people my boyfriend could\u2019ve got really sick, and he couldn\u2019t even eat while like how was the remake worse than the first one??!!! That was just trifling, sickening, and just ridiculous!!! I hate to have to say this about a black owned business and it breaks my heart that I have to write this review, I just won\u2019t hate for somebody to have to go through the same thing we went through and possibly get really sick. But honestly I would not recommend.",

In the beginning, I was excited to patronize a black establishment and hopefully develop a long-term situation with them. However, about a month ago I visited this location for brunch with a friend. At first, things were great - despite having the same staff member that wipes down the tables bring you your food with the same gloves he'd been cleaning with, during Covid - our waiter was pleasant and attentive. I explained to him that I did not eat pork and asked if it was possible to have the shrimp and grits without the bacon bits. Our waiter assured me that all meals were made to order, so there was no problem with having this dish sans the pork. Unfortunately half way through my meal, my friend points out that what I assumed to be red onion pieces in my shrimp and grits was actually bacon bits!! I was horrified! I immediately began to vomit there on their patio. Our waiter was adamant that he shared my exact meal order with the kitchen staff and even went as far as to pull the ticket from the kitchen and show my friend that he specifically wrote \"no bacon\" on the ticket. By this time, I was bawling in tears because I had been committed for so long to this particular dietary restriction and all it took was for one inattentive cook to ruin that for me. There are no words to explain the helplessness I felt and the disrespect I felt the matter was handled with. I will continue to hold businesses accountable for the needs of their patrons, especially when it comes to dietary restrictions. Suppose this were to happen and someone had an allergic reaction? District Soul Food...do better! Pork is killing us anyway; offer an alternative - turkey or chicken bacon - there are so many other options.  Sincerely, Fed Up",

However, the food runner and hostesses wore their masks fully and correctly. The food has changed a bit, must be different chefs. The collard green and smoked turkey rolls are smaller (size of a tightly rolled spring roll) and stuffed with 98% collard greens now. When I went there before they were 3-4times bigger. There's a review from a month ago how they're supposed to look but that's not what I recieved either. Brussel sprouts were super salty. Potato salad was like biting into an onion. Lemon pepper wings are baked and just ok. Fried catfish taste a bit fishy, not fresh. Also, I didn't buy a hookah but it was extremely strong, giving me a headache just from the smoke in the room which is odd. I've been to plenty of hookah spots, some way smaller than the size of that room and it never affected me that way. I don't know what that hookah guy is using but something needs to change. And the wait time for certain things are a bit alarming: 15mins before we were greeted by a hostess; my drink came after my appetizer, my friends soft drink came after we finished the app. I hope you guys read this and change things for the better.",

I went in one Monday, they were out of receipt tape.  No one wanted to take responsibility for the issue.  They actually wanted me to return to sign my receipt.  Who does that?  The office next to the Host stand looks like a junkyard!  Totally unappealing.  Some of the workers lack courtesy.  Was talking to the Hostess, the Manager closed down the regular menu and only offered sides.  After asking to speak to the Manager, he let me order from the full menu.  Another worker kept interjecting into my conversation with the Host until I addressed the issue.  I opened the floor for him to talk, upset he refused to talk further and walked away.  Sometimes it's like a circus of PMS issues in this place with both the men and women.  However, the menu is succulent!",

The patio looks nice and fun and I tried the sweet potato pound cake, it was very sweet and moist. See pic below. The music is a nice choice for a African American establishment.

The hostess was very unfriendly and unhelpful which was also my experience the second time the only difference this time around was that I was actually seated. When I arrived the hostess did not greet me and when I finally was acknowledged she just said \u201chow many\u201d with an unpleasant attitude. We were seated immediately but could not help but to realize all of the staff walking around with their masks on their chins and some not wearing any at all from the hostesses to the chefs in the kitchen. The crab crochets and the Mac and cheese were the only items I would recommend as the rest of the food we ordered was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. The \u201cRum Punch\u201d tasted like cotton candy and had a foamy texture to it . I also ordered the oxtails and the presentation along with the taste was not enjoyable. The gravy to meat ratio was off and the oxtails were over powered by lots of gravy. The presentation of the meal was far from desirable and looked and tasted extremely mushy. The playlist was the saving grace and got me through my unsatisfactory experience at this restaurant. At the end of our meal the server brought the check placed it on the table and literally walked away without saying \u201cthank you\u201d as bare minimum.",

Not to mention the \u201cmanager\u201d was a little rude and argumentative but did give us 15% off our total which was cool I guess. The waitress we had was good except she needed to learn the menu.

After waiting about 15 minutes, I walked to the Bar to see if maybe we should have ordered our drinks from the bar. The Young Lady immediately and very Harshly said, \"DID YOU HAVE A RESERVATION? Upon replying that I was not told we needed one, she walked away from me and turned her back to me. At this point there were 3 staff members behind the bar with no one acknowledging our presence. Smh. We left. I asked for the Owner who apologized, and invited us back, but the damage was done. Hmmmm, maybe I'll try it again, but no time soon.",

The only payment options were cash and Cash app. They charged us $45 pp for bottomless brunch and mimosas which, wouldn't have been bad had the food been good. We should have realized it was suspect when we asked the hostess to see the menu options and they were written in marker on the back of a clip board, but we decided to support since it seems like a black owned business [I'm not sure]. Come to find out, they charge different prices at different times and dont advertise the price so they can upcharge as they please.  I tried the salmon cakes, fried chicken, bacon, mac and cheese, potatoes,  greens, cornbread,  and shrimp. The only items that we're not lackluster where the greens and bacon. Everything else lacked flavor. I could go to several other spots in DC that would give me better quality and flavorful food for less than $45pp. The waitress was not attentive, and wasn't even sure if we can order waffles and eggs from the kitchen, although that is what we were told at the door. After clarifying that waffles in fact could be ordered from the kitchen, we waited about 20 minutes, I asked her to check on them, and they finally came out cold. The serving spoons for the food were mixed up and kept falling on the floor. The mimosas were mostly juice no champagne as you can see from the picture. All in all, if are in a pinch and want bottomless food and juice this is doable, but in my opinion not worth $45 pp since the service and flavor are mild.",

We ordered a variety of dishes only to be told that many were sold out, including their famous crab fries.  That was disappointing.

We experienced looks and comments of who are you people and why are you here!!!  Attempts were made to accommodate and there was clearly a line of miscommunication. First sit down let me get your orders going. Then all of the sudden here comes the unprofessionalism!!! The dirty looks, speaking under ones breath, the feeling of you are not welcome here.  After several minutes the truth comes out. \"We dont take reservations on Saturday\". If you don't take reservations on Saturday why do you think 15 people show up and mention it!!! All of the sudden, \" you have to gather your family that came in from out of town and leave, we have a contract and we are going to honor it\". \"Oh and by the way you're welcome to come back tomorrow for breakfast and the owner will call you.  Plain and simple you double booked!!! Or you have staff that are completely incompetent. To make matters worst we were told to, \"Go over to Ophelia's Fish House\".  Well that was a blessing, the service was awesome they sat my family of 15 next to another party of 15 and the experience was incredible!!!!!  At the end of the day, people make mistakes. We get that and although it can be an inconvenience, it happens. We are not as upset about the mistake as we are about how it was handled. The clear, unwarranted talk, looks and disrespect of the staff towards my wife and my family was disgusting. We did nothing wrong but show up to a reservation looking for a great time and good food. So to be treated with such disrespect- especially by the gentleman who was sitting at the entry of the restaurant was shameful. No food or establishment will ever be good enough to treat people poorly due to your inability to run your business well.",

I was told that since I paid my $50 for the reservation fee that I would not have to pay the $42 for the brunch but the host told me to let you know. Also I\u2019m kind of disappointed on how long it took for me to get food and I had to walk up and down the stairs to check if the food was ready or not.

That includes bottomless mimosas. I need to put an emphasis on cash no card accepted. Anyway, it doesn't matter if you are on the first or second floor. The food is only located on the First floor.  While there customer service was good. Only issue is that there is a two hour time limit and once it is reach they weren't the most professional in asking you to leave.  The food was good, the buffet kept running out of food so sometime you had to wait sometime for the item you wanted. Overall I will give it another try.  They also have a dope cigar bar/ lounge on the second floor.",

I ordered the Fried Whiting meal, and my daughter ordered the fried chicken meal. We both got the greens, she had macaroni and cheese, and I had the sweet potatoes.  Well my fish was fried soft and under seasoned. The greens had a spoiled taste to them. My daughter found a long black hair in her macaroni. And her chicken was undercooked in the center. I did inform our waiter about the issues. His name was Nate he was very polite and attentive. However, the food was a disappointment especially when you live an hour away from DC on a good no traffic day!. Needless to say the General Manager took 25% off the bill, I personally thought my daughter's meal should of been free. You know due to the unwanted hair and the bleeding chicken.  To keep things peaceful I just paid the bill knowing that we will never return and, now I cant bragg and say hey y'all this place was amazing. The General manager was super nice as well! Again it was the food and the price. Which the price for a Whiting dinner was 22 dollars and 18 for the 2 piece chicken.  This would have been fine it the food was on point.",

While waiting, the employees were in the front of the restaurant laughing and joking and opening up bath and body works gift bags, completely not focused on their job. It took an extremely long time for my food to come out and when it did, it was very disappointing. The friend chicken was dry and clearly over fried. The collards were watery and flavorless. The only redeeming part of it was the mac cheese. I was really hopeful that this place would become my new face, as there aren't many places to get soul food in this area.

The mac & cheese was like my southern grandmother's - baked and made with real cheese, with tons of flavor.  Sweet potato mash was delightfully chunky, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar.  The table next to us was raving about their wings (they judge restaurants by their wings, in fact).  The huge hushpuppies that arrived for their appetizer had me seriously contemplating theft.

The food at anyone's mother's house would have been better than what we were fed. Dry macaroni, over cooked vegetables, pork chops and catfish tenders fried to the point of being dried out. The margarita I was served was also below par. I hope management figures out that to command the high prices being charged ($26 for chicken and waffles) the food has to be good.  Oh, and the service is slow and very lacking in attentiveness. Every establishment cannot be Chick-Fil-A but 3 - 5 minutes to be greeted at our table is unacceptable when the place was not that busy downstairs.",
