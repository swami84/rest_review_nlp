There are barriers between the tables and the street but it wasn't comfortable for them. I called to explain and cancel our reservation. Even though it was 15 minutes before we were scheduled to arrive, the person who answered the phone couldn't have been more understanding and kind when I explained to him why we wouldn't be there for dinner. He was exceedingly understanding and invited us to try again another time. I look forward to doing so, very much.",

It wasn\u2019t busy either. We were told by the waiter to wait because they\u2019re checking on  availability. About 5 min later a gentleman walks up to my family, looked like the owner or manager, & let us know nothing was available. Horrible.. I was very much looking forward to eating here & came with quiet an empty stomach.",

We did not have a reservation but we were lucky to get a table because we showed up right when it opened. Fresh, warm bread came out right away. We split a bottle of red wine. We also split the house salad - which was large and ok - reminded us of Olive Garden salad. We both ordered chicken parm (wasn't on the menu but the waitress said they could make it). The chicken was so so tender and delicious. It came with a side of roasted potatoes and french cut green beans. Both were seasoned perfectly. My friend also ordered a side of linguine and I ordered two meatballs.... I think the meatballs were the best part. We ate as much as we could but, ultimately, had to take some home. That meal was an absolute gem! Can't wait to return.",

Did not have a reservation 12:30 in the afternoon, we were 2 ladies   3 tables were filled,  after a brief conference with the waiter the waitress tried to seat the two of us at a table right in front of the door the size of a snack table.  They said all of the other tables were reserved, for 12:30, however there were no other people waiting.  We reluctantly sat there, before we ordered a group of 4 men came in and they did not have a reservation however the waiter agreed to seat them at a table in rear of the place that was not set for guests,  but then moved them to the front.  When I asked if we could sit at the table that he was going to give to the 4 men,  he refused. The waitress said \u201cthe food tastes  the same no matter where  you sit.  That might be true,  but we didn\u2019t get to find out we left,  plenty of good food elsewhere. Very rude!",

We will be back. To ensure there is a table for you, definitely book a reservation in advance. Friendly tip... finding parking in the entire area can be a challenge.

Make a reservation (or you can try to call the day of to do so, if you're dining early, 4 or 5) to not be disappointed... Their house salad is superb, citrus, olive oil: share!  All dishes are fresh, cooked to perfection and spiced perfectly.  It's kind and calm, unlike the other more well hyped Arthur Avenue spots.  If you order right away you'll be out the door too quick. Order a bottle of wine (no bar drinks due to their close proximity to Catholic Church) then an appetizer.  Go slow... servers are nice and attentive, but there is a little (unwarranted) pressure to turn tables, if you don't take control of the pace!  We have brought so many friends here, and all can't wait to return.   [By the way, don't even think about Little Italy downtown NYC, unless you want to be disappointed.]   Arthur Avenue is the only Little Italy that matters!  Mangia!",

After a quick Yelp I noticed a bunch of restaurants in the area. \"Hmmm\" I said, \" Seems to be a lot of Italian restaurants\"   Well, not only did we stumble upon Bronx Little Italy (NY's better one) but on Trattoria Tra di Noi and a nice day just got better.  Hubby and I have a habit of sharing so we can try more new dishes. So I ordered the Fettuccine Carbonara and hubby ordered the Pollo alla Scarpariello ( chicken w/Rosemary,white wine & garlic) which came with potatoes and French cut string beans.  Both dishes were very, very good.  The carbonara ( with fresh fettuccine al dente) had a nice light sauce, not the overly creamy sauce that most other places serve. The bacon was rough chopped and meaty. The Scarpariello was excellent!! The chicken medallions were lightly dredged in flour and perfectly saut\u00e9ed in the wine sauce that had chopped red peppers with whole cloves of garlic and rosemary.  The potatoes seemed to have been roasted but left tender and the string beans lightly streamed.  I also had a cappuccino and that very good as well. We had come at the tail end of a busy Sunday lunch so it was a bit crowed.  Regardless, service was good with water filling and follow up.  What I really liked was that a few people who came in and some of the tables that were already there were greeted warmly by name showing to me that this establishment is part of a close neighborhood where the owners, workers and patrons live amongst each other.  That warmed my heart, and made me vow to come back soon to both Tra di Noi and the Belmont/Little Italy neighborhood.",

        "caption": "Based on what I've eaten here, Tra di Noi is probably the most underrated restaurant on Arthur Ave.  Well not really, since it's about a block off Arthur Ave next to Egidio's, but you get the point.  They've been Michelin recommended--yes, apparently they do make it to the Bronx--for several years.  Based on that and bits of positive chatter that I'd heard for awhile, the first time I went I had decided to break from the normal diet of Mario's and Roberto's/089 to try something new.  The place is pretty small, having only ~15 tables, one bus boy, one waiter, and an owner or 2 acting as hosts.  Except for the bus boy and maybe 1 or 2 guys helping in the kitchen, everything working there was Italian.  Regardless of staffing, service was effective, friendly and helpful.  Decor is very simple and there were red checkered tablecloths for those that are fans (I am).  That would normally imply a much more casual, lower quality establishment.  But in the middle of the left wall was all you needed to see to know that the place is serious: a specials menu 15-20 items long.  Sure, they have a menu of classic Italian American dishes that you can order and they'll be great.  But the specials menu is where your attention really should be.  The biggest negative for Tra di Noi is the lack of a full bar.  Wine list looked like it had some good options though, and while it wasn't listed they do offer a house wine.  Beer list, like at most Italian places, is thoroughly mediocre.  Somebody needs to tell these restaurants that there is good beer in Italy now, and that you can pair it with Italian food.  The girl wanted clams, so we got baked clams.  The clams were small, tender and flavorful.  A bit annoying that we only got 7, but the $10 price point was good.  They used a bit too much breadcrumbs for my taste though, and they weren't very crispy either.  The sauce underneath the clams seemed to be francese which was an interesting twist.  My red snapper marachiare special was great.  The filet was sizable, perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The sauce it was in wasn't the kind of marachiare I was used to in that it wasn't cooked with clams; in principle it was still a marechiare, being a mix of the light tomato sauce of a red clam sauce with the white wine and garlic of a white clam sauce, just minus the clams.  Technicalities aside, it was subtle, delicious and complemented the fish perfectly.  This was $27, and was totally worth it.  My girlfriend liked her chicken scarpariello a lot.  She got it on the bone and it was a great rendition of this classic, with a sizable portion to boot.  I liked how they chopped up and added vinegar peppers while cooking, rather than just throwing them in whole with the dish.  The one piece of chicken I got could've been a bit crisper and juicier, but all the right flavors were there.  These dishes come with potatoes and whatever greens they have, which ended up being green beans.  I usually hate green beans as much as the hiccups--and I hate the hiccups--but these I actually enjoyed.  They were just sauteed with a little olive oil and garlic; simple and delicious.  The potatoes were just small potatoes that were cut into quarters and baked with a little rosemary.  They were crisp and tasty.  I wanted to try their base tomato sauce, so we ended up getting a side of linguini with marinara as well.  The pasta was perfectly al dente as request, and the tomato sauce--contrary to most of the Italian American places nearby--was fresh and light.  Every other meal I've had here has been great as well.  Whether you're new to the area or are a veteran, give this place a shot and I doubt you'll be disappointed.",
