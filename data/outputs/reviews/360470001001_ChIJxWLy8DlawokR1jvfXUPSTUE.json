As soon as I walked in me and girlfriend felt like a nuisance rather than a guest on a slow Saturday evening.  Was served by African American waiter with glasses, seemed normal but was met by passive aggression and negligence for seemingly no reason.  1. Several times rudely told to put dishes back on the used tray for him as he walked away. 2. When given flat wine that tasted like vinegar, was dismissed at first then told to \u201cput the old glass on the tray man.\u201d lol A waiter telling us to bus his dishes for him. 3. Sarcastic comments and negligent service (talking and gossiping while having long waifs between being checked on or given water or ice)  We live up the street so this was a staycation in our own borough, now I know why only tourists who don\u2019t know any better go here.

Cocktails were ok but not impressive or memorable by any means. I ordered a \u201cspicy\u201d Bloody Mary and it was the flattest, most flavourless Bloody Mary I\u2019ve ever consumed. It was oddly sweet and the olives garnishing my drink were so old they sort of melted/disintegrated when I took a bite. So gross and off putting.  Churros for dessert were delicious and the only thing worth ordering which really says a lot.  For the careless and unhelpful service, and some clear sloppiness and the blandness of the meal, I wouldn\u2019t advise coming to this restaurant as there are better options.",

He requested close and casual so it fit his bill. It was our first dinner out in nyc since lockdown (and likely our only meal out about town this year).  I do like that the hotel and restaurant take covid precautions seriously.  The host greeted us at the front, took our temperatures and then let us check in at the reception area.  They explained that there was a 3 step disinfecting process for tables.  Once we were led to our table,  (about 15 mins after our reservation) we were told to view menus by scanning QR codes- so no paper menus to touch.   The tables were nicely spaced out.   And of course, the setting is very pretty, a nice patio, with string lights and far away from car exhaust, pedestrians, runners and bicycles.   if you're neurotic/paranoid/anxious- this  restaurant is an excellent choice.  As for the rest of our experience - i would say it was good to adequate. Our server was pleasant but he struggled to keep up with the tables. I'll spare the details.  I know everyone is trying their hardest and these are trying times.  Our pineapple jalapeno cocktails were excellent (best part of the meal) and the food  (tuna tartare, burger, jerk chicken) was average to just above average.  Portions were generous, prices on the higher end. Gratuity of 18pct (more than fair) will be included in your bill.  Rating: 3.5 rounded up to 4.",

I went there for the second time last Saturday, in hopes that they would redeem themselves from the first experience, but even on a different day with different staff, the experience (other than the food) was absolutely terrible.  Our party waited over 90 mins to be seated, though we tried calling ahead hours before for a reservation. When they finally called our party to be seated, they said we there were less people than what we mentioned over an hour and a half before. The host and who I believe was the manager we're unpleasant and came off disingenuous when we expressed our concerns. They proceeded to tell us that their mistake changes everything. As if to say, we might have to wait another undisclosed amount of time. Eventually they said we can be seated, and sat us at the smallest table you can find...for a party greater than 2! To add insult to injury, there were a significant amount of (larger) tables available that were completely empty, approximately 7...I counted...and just a handful of guests (12) that were dining on their outside patio. When asked why we couldn't sit at their those table, we were told that they were \"reserved\". . .of course they were!!  Minus the extreme wait, I was there with a different party 2 weeks prior and we had a similar incident. In that experience, they told us the only large table available was in the sun with no shade or it's a 45 min to 1 hour wait. We had other plans and decided to opt for the sunny seats. Once we got to the back patio, there once more was just a handful of guests and a significant amount of empty large table in the shade! When asked why we could not sit there, we were told...you guessed it, they were \"reserved\". After 30 minutes in the sweltering sun, we asked if we can relocate to one of the many empty tables in the shade. We were told, they have to wait 10-15 more minutes to see if anyone cancels their reservation. I asked well what time was their reservation, and the time they made-up (I mean told us) was over an hour before. Finally 20 minutes later they squeazed us in the corner at an even smaller table! Yet still after all that time the food took forever to come ( hour for bean burgers with fries), one person in our party order was missing an item.  All I can say is, I will never dine there again and will never recommend anyone to...unless you want to go through a ridiculous and nonsensical experience for a tasty bean burger...the only reason I gave them 1 star was because I couldn't give them \"no stars\".",

This situation wasn\u2019t mentioned anywhere when placing the reservation. We only found out upon being seated. 2) When we explained to the manager that the prix fix and it\u2019s pricing was never discussed and had we known we would have booked some place else and now at 9:30 pm on NYE we are unable to do that, she simply said there is nothing they could do and we had to oblige with the menu since they \u201ctried to call as many people as they could to let them know the dinner would be prix fix\u201d. (She was also pretty condescending during that conversation.) 3) We asked to speak to the general manager to see if we could order individual items from the menu without having to do the full tasting course. He then also said he couldn\u2019t do anything about and would have to escalate it to the chef and speak with him .... we insisted he do so. Finally after about 45 minutes of this travesty the chef agreed to serve the courses individually at a per item price (that the waitress was supposed to inform us on) and the courses would be tasting menu appetizer size). 4) we ended up ordering 2 courses each and a drink or two. At the end of the dinner our bill came out to be $114 per person, which is a gross overcharge. Provided that the tasting menu of 8 courses and I believe 3 drinks came in to be $180 per person. So we paid 2/3 or the price for 2 of the items out of the menu. 5) the waitress never broke down individual prices to us as offered by the GM - just asked what we are ordering. The food took about 25-30 for each course. And everyone was extremely condescending and clearly annoyed with us throughout the whole meal. 5) And last but not least, I woke up at 4am with a severe food poisoning and couldn\u2019t manage it for the next 3 hours. I would think it\u2019s a coincidence, but in this case - seems a bit too uncanny. 6) the 2 stars belong to the very sweet and welcoming bartender who made nice drinks and talked to us for the 30 min we waited for our table to be ready in the first place.",

Our mood soured when we had to wait yet again for more than 15 minutes after asking for the check.  Not sure what went wrong that night, they did not seem short staffed. Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t make a habit out of it.",

I had a problem today because 15 minutes after our orders were placed, two of us were informed that our selection was no longer available. 15 minutes!! You shouldn\u2019t need 15 minutes to know when you\u2019ve run out of something. Because of the long lag informing us, we ended up not ordering our second choice but picking something that could be made quickly and wouldn\u2019t destroy the meal for the entire table due to lag. As it was, our food came out five minutes after the rest of the table. This place aims high and was seriously lacking today. Brunch is supposed to be a happy, relaxing endeavor. Today the opposite was experienced.  I was hard pressed to identify a manager to whom I could complain. The waiter didn\u2019t offer or bring one around even though I made it clear how displeased I was. Perhaps this is a teaching moment, coach the staff to at least pretend to care about the customers.",

Why would you sit us separately for a family event and not even confirming if that is ok with me or not?? We asked to have one table where we were offered to sit outside but there will be an additional charge of $10 per person!! No problem.  We agreed. Reservation was at 5:30pm. Starting around 8pm I had to ask multiple times where is the food and why it's not coming ..especially, when its pre fix menu! At 9:15 i had to ask to cut a cake that we brought were and they charge an additional $5 per person for that. By the time they brought our cake, 70% of my guest had to leave. But wait..pre fix menu came with desert and hot beverages which,  NEVER CAME!!! It is absolutely horrible service and not the best food for the money they charge. Look somewhere else",

Furthermore, I asked for some toast to go with my unsavory frittata.  Three pieces of white bread arrived in an unnecessarily fancy plate (along with some jam and some other spread which I didn\u2019t recognize, and neither of which I ordered).   I would later find out that I was charged eight (8!) dollars for this bread showmanship.  I wasn\u2019t told that it would cost 8 dollars to get three slices of white bread.   I certainly would not have ordered.  All in all, poor quality on everything and in general a rip off.",

The BEST ENTREE hands down is the scallops with grits. Now...I HATE GRITS...but this dish has turned me into a believer. I probably will not eat anybody grits but this restaurant. This seriously will be my go to restaurant especially for the summer time. All the waitstaff were super friendly and efficient. I didn't feel too rushed and I also didn't feel like I was waiting around even when it got really busy. I had the sangria which was delicious and quite strong which..YES.thank you for that Oh...dessert. The strawberry shortcake was sooo memorable. Again, NOT a fan of shortcake but I would definitely get this EVERY time. Imagine cake with nice cold whip cream filled with fresh sweet ripe strawberries. Long story short, this place is a GEM.",

The hostess politely refused to sit us, saying she'd do that when it's close to my reservation time. There were lots of empty seats so i was like ???? But sure. When we returned close to our reservation time, there was a gentleman before us wishing to be seated earlier than the reservation time. She again politely refused. The man pointed out empty seats but she said they are reserved and the time is coming soon. Ok. Understandable. We were seated but the service was very slow.

But I live close to the restaurant and the weather was really nice so gave it a try anyways for a walk to the area. After our first bites, my husband and I were simply blown away! Their egg sandwich was just divine, cornmeal pancake was perfect, and the fries were thin and crispy. The service could be faster, but the restaurant was extremely busy and packed so the slow pace of the service was understandable. Overall, it was a pleasantly slow yet delicious weekend brunch.",
