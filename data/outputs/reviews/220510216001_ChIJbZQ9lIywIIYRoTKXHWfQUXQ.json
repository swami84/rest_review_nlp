Took forever for the Pizza and when it arrived, the pizza was soggy and greasy.  Couldn't even pickup a slice of pizza so soggy.  Ended up just eating the Sub and left the entire pizza minus a slice on the table.  Prices were a little on the high side, especially $1.50 for a can of Coke, not even with a cup of ice.  Not what I was expecting with a 4.2 Rating.  I Just don't see how they have a high rating with soggy and greasy pizza.  Service was GREAT, the lady seemed friendly and energized.  Thanks for a Delicious Meatball Sub.",

The wings were good but the shrimp on the salad were so overcooked I couldn't eat some of them. When I called the next morning to tell them about the shrimp I was told that's just how they cook the shrimp and that I would have to call the delivery company.  I don't see why I have to call the delivery company when there wasn't a problem with the delivery but with the actual food. I have never had shrimp that overcooked before. Might be a while before I order again and it definitely won't be something with shrimp.",
