The woman who served me and my partner gave me that west African woman look  that they give to those of us born 400 years away from Africa  ... you know the look ... that we should  know... and we should!!!  The food is strangely familiar and wonderfully new like the first time you heard Fela Kuti.  She even sat a water bowl next to me and said \" you know what to do with this.\"  There was no question in her voice...I hand to eat with my hand  -  the right hand of course!!  I had the white soup with pounded yam and  my Dominican partner had jolof rice with beef and plantains ( of course!!! --- Dominicans are undercover Africans ).  That night  I dreamed of the food - really.  I did.  But be careful it can be spicy in a way that is different than Mexican hot.. Like Fela's music  you need to give your body time to catch up with you soul. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT visit before you order online  and ask for a suggestion.  Remember  almost all the dishes have cured fish in it . it's an essential spice like fish sauce in Thai food. Finally -The West African approach to beef  is different from  European and Asian cuisine.   It's served with more texture (  some   might call it \"tough\") and very well done. Again  like Fela's music you need to give your body time to catch your soul.",

There are a number of menu choices, but our charming server, Favor, helped us pick the jollof rice with beef and plantains. We ordered it with a little extra spice and the heat was just right. Looking forward to our next visit to try some of the other choices. Nice addition to the neighborhood!",
