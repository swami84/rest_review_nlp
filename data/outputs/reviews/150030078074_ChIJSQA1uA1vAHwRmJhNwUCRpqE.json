Overall, the store seemed clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. I ordered a box of a dozen different donuts, so that I could try each of their flavors. The donuts ranged from pretty good to so awful I ended up throwing some of them out. I found the more simple ones (such as the basic glazed donut and cream filled donuts) to be more enjoyable. I enjoyed the Boston cream and Bavarian cream donuts the most. The more unique flavors (such as the sour cream donut and the lemon filled donut) weren't as enjoyable to me, and I couldn't even finish the sour cream donut. Strangely enough, I've heard other people say the sour cream donut was their favorite, but for me it had a flavor that was decidedly not sour cream, and instead more like a flowery, soap-like taste. Maybe the sour cream donut is a strange artifact that changes flavor depending on the individual. Or the one I ordered was a bit off. Or I was just missing something!  Either way, the donuts were decent, with a few flavors I would definitely not get again. I paid for my order with a gift card, and I'm not sure if I'd really go out of my way to spend my own money at Dunkin, unless I really want sweets and have nowhere else to go.",
