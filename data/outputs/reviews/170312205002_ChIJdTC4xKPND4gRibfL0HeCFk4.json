It gave the place a little bit of a sports bar vibe (which in Logan is not everyone\u2019s favorite) but was fine for me since I like sports. There were football games playing on there. Brunch menu had lots of options for food and cocktails. It all sounded very good. We shared the lox, huevos, and smash burger with some mimosas to wash it all down. Everything was very tasty and our server and the rest of the staff were all very friendly.",

My friend arrived early and had an order of elote fritters ready and waiting, which were quite tasty. For dinner I ordered the barbacoa tacos, which was  an order of three tacos of corn tortilla with brisket, onion and cilantro. The taco had a slight kick if heat. Overall the tacos weren't the best I've ever had, but still tasty. I also ordered the cauliflower small plate with was dressed with vegan sweet and sour sauce. These were really good. My only critique was they added a bit too much sauce. There was a pool of it at the bottom of the bowl. My friend ordered the Smash Burger which really seemed to enjoy cause she devoured it, haha. Overall the place had a good atmosphere and tasty food. Would definitely visit again.",

My biggest issue is the cauliflower. This is clearly their vegetarian \"buffalo wings\" option.

The meat fell apart and it was covered in way too much cheese. Nothing else to top it but sauce (which was good) and a bun. Both myself and my girlfriend didn\u2019t finish them. The sever came by and asked to see if we were okay because they had noticed we didn\u2019t eat much. They took the burgers away and gave us 20% off on the bill (having worked in the industry, comping one would have been more appropriate). While paying the check I noticed another lady that had ordered the burger, with an upset look on her face, scraping off a good amount of the cheese before taking a bite. We didn\u2019t try anything else, but based on the burger, I\u2019m apprehensive on the menu. If you\u2019re looking for a great burger in Chicago, this one needs a lot of work to even get an \u201chonorable mention.\u201d",

        "caption": "Very sad to see Dunlays go.  Merchant has potential to be a solid replacement.  Drinks:  Beer list was good, full of the plenty of locals.  The cocktail list was full of \"spin on a classic\" cocktails.  The spicy Paloma was fantastic.  The whole table switched to this for the second round.  Appetisers:  The chicken wings are giant lightly breaded and fried crispy.  The 75' sauce is a light slightly sour ginger lemongrassy coating.  The wings came practically naked and needed to be tossed.  I would like a slightly thicker sauce or more of it.  The elotes fritters were fantastic.  Tasted like authentic esquites in fried fritter form.  The app that we were most excited for was the fried rice arancini on a bed of homemade kimchi.  It was great.  Had a nice slight fish sauce funk to it that went perfect with the sweet/sour/spicy dipping sauce.  I would like a bit more spicy, but the balls were great.  Main courses:  We opted to share the large size entrees, overall they were really really good.  We saved the \"handhelds\" for next time.  4 of us shared the raviolo, the salmon, and the grilled octopus.  This was a good amount of food with the apps.  Starting with the raviolo.  I am not misspelling it, it is a singlular ravioli, filled with homemade queso fresco and runny egg.  The plate is covered in the corn and chorizo flavored ground sausage.  The raviolo was good, but the grilled corn and sausage was really the Star of the dish.  I think it could be improved as a gnocchi or multiple mini ravioli.  The grilled octopus was perfect, I wouldn't change anything on it.  Spicy baslmic glaze with onions and red peppers, great dish.  The salmon was a dark horse dish.  I wasn't super excited about it from menu description, but they executed it flawlessly.  Large piece of salmon cooked perfectly medium rare with a super crispy skin served on a bed of mouth watering grilled leeks.  Would eat again for sure.  The waitress said those leeks will also be part of a feta omlet when they start doing brunch.  They have a kids menu, but none printed yet.  The chicken tenders were so fantastic I told the chef they need to be an entree.  Panko breaded chicken thighs served with the sweet/sour/spicy sauce and fries.  We had a side of fries, double fried with a side of what seemed to be catsup aioli.  Nice and salty, very crispy.  Service staff made a few small mistakes, but nothing a bit more experience will solve. I think once they get a bit more familiar with the menu and the flow, this will be as fantastic addition to the neighborhood.  If they make the chicken tenders a regular menu item, I will go back just for them.  Bathroom has changing table.",
