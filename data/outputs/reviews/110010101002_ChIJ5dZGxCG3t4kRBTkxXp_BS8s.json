First of all instead of the eggs being mixed in they were just dumped on top, and the chicken is disgusting and i\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s chunks of shrimp in my meal, if someone had a seafood allergy that could literally kill them. Never giving them my money ever again and I strongly suggest you don\u2019t either.",

It's on the second floor and there isn't really any signage on the outside that says, BKK Thai.  The restaurant is small but has plenty of tables. It was completely empty on a Friday evening. I imagine it has more business at lunchtime. It's not really a place to go for ambience or to hang out, but it just might be my go-to Thai takeout place!  I love Panang Curry and BKK makes it just the way I like it! It was creamy, spicy, and slightly sweet. So good! I also ordered the veggie Tom Yum Soup and the Chive Dumplings. The soup was very tangy and tart, the dumplings were fried cubes of a starchy consistency. Everything was very flavorful and very spicy.",
