I would NOT recommend doing this package. But would possibly come back for admission only.  The locker rooms were very clean and well stocked with all types of toiletries, towels, and slippers. The pools and saunas were great and most patrons seemed to be maintaining social distancing and following mask wearing protocols.  In my opinion there should be a staff member in the pool and sauna areas enforcing the rules of the establishment. For example, there was a group of girls being loud and obnoxious with their flash on taking a photo shoot. Also, there was another person eating a granola bar in the pool throwing her crumbs everywhere. This behavior should not be taking place and no one was there to stop it.  The massages were the highlight of the experience. Extremely professional and relaxing. Daniel and Stephanie took great care of us.  As for the dinner..... There was a mix up in our reservation, totally at the fault of the restaurant, but management did accommodate us and send us complimentary drinks. I was under the impression that we would get to choose our own plates, but I was wrong, it is whatever the chef sends out. We had a mix of really great plates and some not so good. What upsets me the most is that we were charged $150 for the dinner....but then when we added up the price of all the plates we received it totaled to less than $120. I left feeling totally scammed and disappointed after dinner. This is why I do not recommend doing this package. If I would have eaten a la carte, I would have ordered what I actually wanted to eat, save $, not be scammed paying extra $ for nothing, and actually enjoyed my experience. Totally disappointed. Hopefully other people read this and don\u2019t make the same mistakes I did.",

The bathrooms provide personal lockers, as well as feminine products, combs, blow dryer, towels, and most importantly slippers ( for those of you who forget, don\u2019t panic ). Once you leave the dressing room, you make your way downstairs. Disclaimer, the pools are pretty small. 1st pool is warm. 2nd is the cold pool, and the last is mini pool. 2 ppl max.  You have 2 sauna and a steam room.  They provide cold water downstairs and endless amount of towels. It\u2019s pretty quiet when it\u2019s not crowded. I would say after 3/4 it gets pretty busy. If you book a massage and body scrub, I highly recommend Stephanie.  She\u2019s great.",

Some sauna rooms are kept too mild in temperature for a real sauna experience, particularly the tropical sauna room. The best is definitely the steam room.  One thing I really disliked was the music blasting inside the sauna rooms. It really ruins the experience and I'd highly recommend keeping the music down in the rooms or removing it altogether in the future. I think it's only suitable for the common pool areas. The idea is to relax and take in the experience, not to feel like I'm in a club or the gym.  I'd also recommend they keep the COVID-19 guidelines a bit more strict as it gets quite full in the afternoons.  I think there should be 4-6 people max considering the small size of the space.  Apart from that I think this place is great and has great potential for improving.",

I had gotten there by 6pm with a girlfriend of mine, and it was not what we expected for the amount we paid. The place actually looks larger in the pictures than what it really is in person, so I'd be afraid to see this place on a busy day... (as people were sharing the same small pools in close proximities)  PROS: Beautiful art, signage, ambiance; the locker room was pristine & provided all of your essentials; combs, qtips, robes, towels, slippers, hair ties, deodorant spray, face mist..etc.  HOPE THIS HELPS!",

I had the reboot experience which is a 30 minute massage with a 15 scrub. Wow.. Beverly was my therapist and they were incredible. So attentive to my body and communicative. The scrub was so luxurious and exactly what I needed! I really enjoyed the entire facility especially the restaurant wow! It was a Wednesday and It felt like I was having a private dinner tasting. They also can accommodate dietary restrictions which was special. Overall 10/10 highly recommend, relax, book Beverly, Steam, swim, and eat!!! I\u2019ll be back very soon",

The amenities were fun, and pristine with people practicing social distancing / wearing masks. Lot of different options from cold plunge, to hot tub, to sauna, steam room, etc. Lastly, the restaurant was incredible. We got a tasting menu with various items that were all organic and very flavorful. We also got to eat in bathrobes which was unique and enjoyable. Would highly recommend the restaurant even if you do not go to the Bathhouse. Amazing food.  Finally, the service was A+. Every staff member was super friendly, young, lively and fun, especially at the restaurant where it really felt like a neighborhood spot.  I would suggest people try this place.

So much more relaxing than any Manhattan spa. I also love the sauna master sessions they have - so much fun and very immersive.  In the meantime, please continue to dine at their restaurant to support them through this time! Their cocktails and food are so utterly refreshing - everything on the menu is the opposite of sweet, rather depending on inventive flavor combinations to entertain the tastebuds.

They even had a electrolyte mocktail.  Safe to say the best experience I\u2019ve had in a long time. Left feeling absolutely incredible.",

I never leave reviews, however my experience at Bathhouse has been so exceptional that I felt the need to sit down and write this.  I have been to Bathhouse more times than I can remember both pre and post covid. I have yet to find a better place to relax, recharge, and decompress in all of NYC. The Service and Staff are Extremely attentive. The Facility is gorgeous, clean, and feels very safe with the Covid Measures they have implemented.  I highly recommend any of the treatments, however my favorite is the Bathhouse Experience Package which includes, a stretch, scrub, and hour massage. And dont forget to swing by the Restaurant after, in your robe of course, because why not! All of the food and drinks that I have tried have been great, however my Go Drink is the \"Tropical Sauna\" highly recommend if you like a spicy marg. As far As Food goes, you cant go wrong with the Chefs Tasting.  Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Highly reccommend if you are stressed or looking for a great meal in your robe! Go Check it out!",

My fianc\u00e9 and I did the couples massage today, and I will preface that the two massages were wonderful other than these two things that sadly made the experience tainted:  1. Every 3-4 minutes the song would skip and then come back on full volume... for a 60-minute massage it makes it really hard to relax when you\u2019re listening to a song skip like a 90s CD. After asking the them to turn it off since they couldn\u2019t get the skipping to stop, we were able to hear people talking in the pools and it was just offsetting.  2. The check in experience was overly minimal - and felt like it was lacking soemthing, and then when we got the bill on our CC statement, it has a $70 tip added that we DIDNT ADD OR AUTHORIZE. After calling, they said that \u201cif you don\u2019t go to the desk to check out (which wasn\u2019t ever mentioned or asked) that they close out the payment with a 20% tip... without asking you.  So, all in all, definitely a beautiful place but hard to feel good about a $400 hour experience with this sort of professionalism.",

The dirty towel that was given right at check in. It felt there was a lack of care for complete service from when you walk in and start this relaxing experience.

People are loud and you get a lot of bro\u2019s in there as well as obnoxious soul cycle types of women. No one has common courtesy for others personal space.  The website makes the space look a lot bigger then it is. They have three small pools. The cold on is cold, the largest which is still small is like lukewarm bath water and the hot pool is tiny and not hot enough.  Found both saunas and steam rooms to not be very hot. Marble slabs to sit on where not heated well and overrun by those taking it up I. Themselves to lay down and take over the whole area. Locker rooms were ok, not enough hooks for jackets or towels. Not enough bench space. Also they needed better signage and should consider some lounge chairs around the perimeter.  Overall it\u2019s a great local edition but they need to limited the amount of people who can go in. I\u2019d try going back during a weekday.",

It is another chaotic space in NY, no relaxing areas, no quiet anywhere. Music is quite loud, people is hanging out as if it is a party; it feels more like a dating/social space than a real bath house. I tried the floating tank and didn\u2019t receive any advise about the possibility of having issue at my eyes: during the floating they started to be itchy and after few hours they eye contour is all red, itchy as if I have an eczema. I was supposed to spend few hours at the bath house but, after the tank experience, I left almost immediately as it was very chaotic; i payed three admission fee for almost nothing and although I immediately shared my concerns (and I was told they are hearing them quite a lot) I wasn t offered any attention but a simple \u201cI am sorry\u201d.

A good offering of toiletries in the bathroom, ample towels, clean slippers, and lots of seating inside the saunas and nice placement of the ice bath. Staff were nice and very accommodating.  I do have a few recommendations.  The hairdryer in the women\u2019s bathroom was sad. Please get the Dyson hairdryer!!! It is a game changer and necessary given the clientele and demographic of the neighborhood. A hairdryer that actually dries hair (and quickly) is also a practicality in the winter months.  Recommend doing fruit water or teas at the beverage station. That\u2019s usually what is done in the Russian bath houses. This would be nice.  Dry saunas were not hot enough. Need to increase each by at least ten degrees. It also just makes people have to sit in the saunas longer for the same effect. This is a must.  Have birch branches and/or cute sauna hats for sale. Would be cute for it to have the bath house logo. I would purchase and use at each return visit.  Some more tables/lounge chairs in the pool or upstairs. It would be nice to be able to lounge and play cards or chat with friends while sipping tea. Understood if this is not the vibe but this would be much more representative of European style bath houses.",

There are two saunas and one steam room, but they are definitely spacious. Loved the heated marble benches staying true to an original hammam!

Spent the afternoon cycling between the different pools (hot, cold, warm), the two saunas and steam room. Very interested in trying the sensory deprivation tank and cryo. As an avid listener of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, I\u2019ve heard the great benefits both have. Will come back next time to experience first-hand! My holiday shopping is also done! Spa treatment packages for my family!!! Highly-recommend everyone check this place out!",

Love the idea of mixing the old world traditional methods (steam, sauna, cold plunge, etc) with modern day tech (float tank, cryo, etc).  Having a top notch restaurant there is a huge plus. You can easily spend an entire afternoon or evening at Bathhouse.",

Amazing design, clean, friendly staff, and all the amenities you\u2019d want (treatments, two saunas, a steam room, three baths, etc). You feel like you\u2019re entering a new world when you walk down the stairs into the bathhouse area. Street level has an attached restaurant and locker rooms. I\u2019d recommend going with a few friends or your significant other. It feels more communal than most other bathhouses in the city (like bathhouses in other countries), so bringing a group of friends for a birthday or just to hang  out would be great.",
