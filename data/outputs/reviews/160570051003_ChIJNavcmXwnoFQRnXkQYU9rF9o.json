For instance keep the standard 9oz chicken curry option, but then also add a 13 oz option (keep naan/salad standard size) & increase the price accordingly. The portion size at the current moment is great if you aren\u2019t super hungry (or you\u2019re a small person like me), but definitely don\u2019t think it would fill up an extra hungry human. Anyway, the food was absolutely delicious, and I only say the small suggestion on the portion size because it would be great to eat more without having to order a whole second meal! \ud83d\ude0a",

The menu clearly states which meals have gluten (and dairy and soy and meat) and the server and owner were very knowledgeable and aware of what was safe for me to eat. The server made sure to be extra careful when preparing my meal which was amazing!! The food was excellent and the portion size was perfect for me! The price was really good for home cooked food and fresh ingredients. Will definitely recommend Mela to friends!!",

And in good weather it's a happening square with kids running everywhere. The menu is limited but the food is tasty. It's better to do a few things well than a hundred things adequately. So far I've had the curry, biryani, and samosas, and the flavor is the reason for the long lines at the Farmer's Market. I've been to many dozens of Indian and Desi restaurants around the US. There's something about Bangla cooking to differentiate it from Indian; I couldn't describe it but Mela has it, and it's a welcome difference versus generic Americanized Indian fare. It's also wonderful to enjoy a bit of spiciness without having to beg for it. We are blessed to have two south Asian establishments in town now. For formal guests I need to impress with ambience I'll go to Karma but for myself and friends, a tasty curry with IPAs is unbeatable. 5/4/2019 update: got the lamb curry, delivered to the bar at Slice. The lamb was tender and lean, the curry was spicy and delectable, and the rice was infused with cumin and cardamom (or something. Wonderful spices). Mmmmm.",

Seating is also available inside. It didn't look like it at first, but when you go inside to order there is a bar and a table and chairs. It was rainy when we went so this was a deal-breaker if there was no indoor seating.  The food is made by an actual Indian woman from family recipes. I had the Paneer with spinach and was told that it is prepared differently than other places. It was delicious even though it didn't look very appetizing. I have not eaten it before so I wasn't sure what to expect. The sauce has pureed spinach, so no stringy wilted leaves,  and large cubes of cheese. You can get it with rice or peas instead of the spinach, as well as naan, which I did. A small salad makes the meal. I also tried the Mango Lassi which was very good; can't go wrong there. My husband got the chicken curry and enjoyed it as well. Prices are pretty reasonable for what you get. Portions aren't small or over the top large either. The menu online doesn't have all the available options. When we went there she also had a salmon curry that sounded intriguing. There were other menu items listed as well. Credit/Debit is accepted. Not sure about checks. I would definitely recommend and will go back to try other things there as well.",

And when we were pregnant again and very sick Abtesam blessed us with food!!! They are such a kind family - and her sons always made me laugh \ud83d\ude04 - and you can tell that cooking food for people is her calling. I am so grateful we can now have the beautiful flavors of Bangladesh outside of market season.  Tonight our family of five feasted on the garbanzo curry, the lamb curry (amazing), and the paneer curry plus lentil soup (she added that in for us, because she just cannot quit being generous) and an order of piyaju (pakora). The sauces are beautiful, balanced, and perfectly spicy (my kids love it, but I know not all kids are accustomed to spice). I crave these flavors!  It\u2019s easy to pop in to their 2nd street location (it\u2019s tucked away on the east side of the patio near the play structure) and place an order for take out, though there is also a small area to dine in along a bar with stools. Our large to-go order was ready in less than ten minutes. You could also eat outside on the patio.  A meal is perfectly sized for a hearty adult portion (comes with salad and a choice of naan or rice) and easily shared by smaller kids.  Everything is made from scratch, and it is like being invited to sit down at the table and feast with their family, that\u2019s the Mela magic. This food is made with love.",

Naan bread was pretty good could be better, don't believe they make their own Naan bread(don't quote me on that). Mango Lassi was not too sweet, that's a plus. Probably the best Indian food around this area, but the selection is lacking.",

Great service, friendly people, nice ambiance and obviously amazing delicious food. I am certainly going back and recommend this not only to people from the sub-continent but to everyone.",

For the last few years, Moscow\u2019s had a thriving restaurant scene with a notable absence of South Asian cuisine.  Mela is filling that gap, and doing it wonderfully.  Their opening night in mid-August of 2018 packed their courtyard with hungry fans & friends.  We enjoyed plates piled with Paneer, Biryani, Naan, Samosas and other favorites.  In good weather, their courtyard is one of the most pleasant places in Moscow to enjoy a meal.  Now, Mela lets you pair that excellent location with some of the best food in town.",
