New experience for my husband and me - we ate at the take-out restaurant, though I believe they also have a full service restaurant close by. We shared the Arvoz Chaufa - Peruvian \"chinese style\" fried rice and a 1/4 of a barbecue chicken. Also ordered a side order of sliced avacado. The rice was delicious with large chucks of chicken - you could also order shrimp. Could have made a meal out of the rice as it was a fairly large portion. As this is basically a take-out restaurant, seating is limited.",

Well, everything was unchopped, and when I asked for the broccoli to be chopped--you know, so it's easier to eat--he picks up a piece and shows it to me saying, \"the broccoli isn't that big\". Mind you, these are standard sized broccoli pieces... Like the ones you'll find in most Chinese restaurants.  The chicken breast was just that, a big intact whole chicken breast plopped on top of the lettuce, requiring you to cut it with the plastic knife they give you. Bacon strips were the same, unchopped and normal strips you would make yourself if you were cooking bacon. Same exact thing with the avocado... Funnily enough, they managed to chop the boiled egg they gave you, while leaving everything else entirely intact... Needless to say, I found this incredible.  The salad was just a chore to eat, and lazily crafted. It was essentially a bunch of ingredients on a plate. If you're into that, then you'll love it here, but if you're expecting anything remotely closely to an actual chopped salad, you won't find it here. A salad with a side of manual labor basically, since you'll be doing a lot of cutting chicken. Fun :)  The one redeeming quality is that they give you a lot of food for $8. But with that same $8, you can go to your grocery store and buy the ingredients yourself and lay them out on a plate same exact thing.",
