We are very well traveled and I would like to say this is an absolutely fantastic restaurant.  It is clean, smells great and the service is outstanding.  Our server Hannah never ran out of answers regarding the food and on rare occasions when she did not know something she volunteered to find out immediately.  Hannah is half Brazilian but you would think that she is pure Indian from her fund of knowledge about this food.  We highly recommend this place to anyone who wishes to try authentic, good quality, well-prepared Indian food.  We hope they continue in business for a long time into the future.  God bless them.",

Chicken Korma!!! one of my favorite Indian dishes but I've never had a Korma like this.  The sauce was almost floral tasting, so good,  can't wait to order it again. The rice that came with was perfectly cooked and fragrant.  The GARLIC NAAN bread, I think we will order 2 next time and take it home for snacks. After we ate I called the restaurant to thank them for the delicious dinner and to let them know how good it was. The gentleman on the phone was very humble and thanked me....he said they are a small business trying to stay in business. Support this place, you won't regret it!!

I\u2019ve ordered multiple times from here and every time the food has been flavourful and true to the taste. Some of my must tries are: Gobhi Manchurian, Samosa Chaat, Keema Naan, Garlic Naan, Butter Chicken, Chicken Jalfrezi and the Traditional Curry. The quantities are generous and the spice levels are totally customizable. After multiple orders I can safely say, you can never really go wrong with any of the items at Masala Mantra. Kudos to the team for a fab and consistent job always!",

The atmosphere was inviting and peaceful. And the food was aromatic, complex in flavors, with perfect spicing that awakens my pallet. My mom got the lamb chops that were to die for. They were coated in a beautiful meldoy of flavors in the dry rub and cooked to a perfect tender texture. I got the the tikki masala (the first menue item) it was so creamy and wonderful. The chicken was cooked perfectl, juicy and flavorful. The cooked in rose water and coconut very subtly but such a perfect touch. We also got onion Nan bread. The bread had a delectable buttery outside and sweet onions throughout the fluffy Nan bread. We also got cauliflower that was cooked to perfection it fooled my husband and I to thinking it was chicken.",

And of course we paired this with some garlic naan. Our meal was outstanding, the soft music was delightful, and our hosts were very friendly.

Few years ago my wife and I were in NYC we in an upscale Indian restaurant name \u201c Tamarind Tribeca \u201c and we can easily say that we found a better tasting food with a much better prices here in Cape Coral Florida ( who would believe... ) . We are very foodie people and we always go to restaurants ,  but this the first review we ever wrote !!!!  Also worth mentioning , we have a friend that only eats Halal meat , and this restaurant serves Halal meat , so now we can take our friend and he can enjoy it with us  , because other Indian restaurants in the area are not Halal .  To the restaurant staff: Thank you so much for the great service and a great experience.",

I called them to let them know how hot it was in case that batch was made a little hotter than normal so it wouldn\u2019t bother other customers.  They offered to replace it I said no that\u2019s OK.  They even offered to deliver another meal for free.  I really didn\u2019t want any compensation I was just letting them know in the case that somebody who was less tolerant of of a spicy dish ordered it.  I thought that would be the end of it and they had wonderful customer service in offing to compensate even though I refused it.

It was excellently crafted with nuts, dates, and honey. We also tried the Somasosa and was also excellent with a little spice kick. I'm not a spice lover and found it quit tasty.  For dinner, we had lamb curry mild and Shrimp Biryani medium spice. Wife thought the medium was too spicy for her but I thought it was perfect. So order mild if you are not used to India spices.  For desert we tried the plate in the photo with 3 balls. Very tasty and sweet. Liked the naan so much, we took 2 extras to go.  The service from Karan was perfect. And the restaurant is modern design and looks new.  If you have a vegan in the family this is a good place to take them. Many options for them. Note, they don't take reservations as of this posting date.  10 out of 10 across the board.",

Plus, as much as I try to culture my kids, they are not apt to trying new dishes. We ordered the kids a mild Masala Fry, and as a backup, we ordered American style chicken nuggets and fries. Let's just say we didn't need the backup, but what a great option for families with picky kids. The ambience is right on; not too loud, not to quiet - a perfect cover for noisy little ones. I am so glad I found this restuarant. We were with another family and also ordered the CK Tikka Masala, LB Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken, Salmon, and desserts. Everyone can't wait to go back.

My friend and I ate at Masala Mantra this past Monday for the lunch buffet, so we could try several of their dishes. The decor was decent, small and slightly bland, so it did have that \"bistro\" feel to it.  It was clean, though. The buffet price was very reasonable.  I'll never understand why they put silverware at the beginning of a buffet, though, when you have to carry your plate with one hand and serve with another.  Anyway, the naan bread was good as was the basmati rice(s)- two kinds. The Tandoori chicken however was overcooked and dried out.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was good.  There were no Dal dishes, though. My friend loves the Saag Paneer and it is usually on a buffet, but not this one, so she paid an additional $13 for a small order of it.  We both tried it, and it was very bland, like spinach just out of the blender. Waste of money. There weren't any slivered almonds or golden raisins in the rice dessert either, so it was a little bland also. Service was good. I believe that this restaurant really has some potential though if they would add the proper spices and seasonings to the dishes, and offer the spinach and dal dishes on the buffet. I may give it one more try in a couple of months to see if it's any better, but if not I can just cook it at home.",

This gives me 2  evaluating points: judging the same food across restaurants and whether the restaurant got their cooking basics right.  Unfortunately ( and granted maybe it was a one-off day for the chef) the food was not just substandard ,it was also visually unappealing.  The tandoori chicken tasted more like barbecued chicken sprinkled with Indian spices and the Potato/ Cauliflower did not have the usual yellow/orange hue but was dark and dreary looking with the vegetables unidentifiable and covered with a green substance that almost made us wonder whether they had given us spinach by mistake !  I consider myself an Indian food lover and perhaps I\u2019m setting the bar too high. Undoubtedly there will be people who love this restaurant\u2019s offering and to them I apologize but I for one was disappointed by the food\u2019s mediocrity.",

We've eaten there three times already in the two weeks they've been open and I got some samosas to carry out another day.  For those who are new to Indian cuisine, you will find the atmosphere very welcoming and the menu explains the dishes well enough that you will be able to make good choices even if you are unfamiliar with the dishes.  Don't be afraid to try something new.  For those very familiar fans of Indian cuisine, you will find that this is just what you've been looking for.

These factors alone should make you give Masala Mantra a try but I have absolutely NO DOUBT you will return again and again, because these are the best hosts of any restaurant I have ever visited. The restaurant is nicely appointed, very comfortable and clean. The buffet offerings were delicious with some dishes not found at the other buffets. The food is not \"spicy\" unless indicated, but is really flavorful and there are sauces available to add any heat level you can stand.  My party consisted of 3 generations of my family and every member,  aged 82, 58,  and 19 received the same courteous attention that cannot be feigned. All 3 of us left feeling happy- well fed and treated like family. These are lovely hearted people who want to serve you delicious food and serve it well. And they DO.  I give Masala Mantra my highest recommendation . They are everything a restaurant should be- and more.",
