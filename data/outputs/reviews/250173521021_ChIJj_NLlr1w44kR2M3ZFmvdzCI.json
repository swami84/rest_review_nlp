        "caption": "My wife and I were looking for an outdoor eating opportunity for Saturday night dinner. We were referred to Bambara by our gourmand and exquisitely tasteful grandson. We implicitly trust his food sensibilities, so off we went after making a reservation, never expecting the gustatory celebration that was to follow. While many have reviewed the quality of the food - worthy of the above 5 star rating - the back story is what intrigued us. The presence of Executive Chef David Bazirgan at this well-hidden secret reminded us of the fable of the Jewel in the Robe, wherein a wealthy man sows a priceless jewel into the hood of his poor and unsuspecting friend's cloak while he slept, and then must leave unexpectedly. Years later, when he finds his friend still impoverished, the wealthy man inquires as to how this could be. Upon discovering the hidden gem, the pauper's life is instantly changed.  While I admit that our dining experience was not quite as earthshaking, it was nonetheless a great surprise to experience one of the best meals we have dined on here in our fair city. And the truly remarkable fact is that for whatever the reason it was one of the most reasonably priced meals we have experienced in Boston - and we dine out not infrequently. We echo Ted Weesner's 2017 Boston Globe review: our dining experience was at the hands of a master chef.  We started with one of the real standouts in the white wine category, a glass of J. Lohr Chardonnay, a fine, well-oaked yet buttery selection chilled to perfection. This was followed by the Choereg bread loaf with honey butter, a sophisticated take on a traditional Armenian Easter bread. Soft, succulent, delightful.  We eschewed any further appetizer distractions and went right to the main courses - an order of the House made Fusilli and the Kutobuta Pork Chop. The pesto and pecorino infused fusilli with snap peas and asparagus was zesty, rich, and complex, and completely enjoyable. The pork chop was thoughtfully complemented with goat cheese grits, a first for me, broccolini - broccoli's much more flavorful cousin, and grilled peaches, the perfect complement to the rich yet not overbearing spicing of the pork.  The sole desert offering, the apricot tart, needed no competition. It was perhaps the best part of the meal. Of course I have a serious sweet tooth, so from that standpoint I am biased.  While we hate like hell to give away our secrets, it is one we simply could not keep to ourselves. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did...we'll be back.",

We ordered a wide assortment, and most everything was either disappointing or almost inedible. The duck confit hash was THE ONLY dish that was considered OK among our group. The French toast was cold, dry & inedible. The Armenian breakfast sandwich was also dry and unpleasant & the salmon ceviche was prepared by someone who has never eaten or seen ceviche in their lives.  Despite the restaurant being pretty empty, we took turns hunting down staff to move our order along - everything took forever. I have a hunch they were short staffed, so I\u2019m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  It was quite kid friendly though, with a good assortment of crayons and palatable kid options. The fresh squeezed juice was nice as well. In general, the eggs were well prepared, but I\u2019m really reaching for silver linings at this point.  I rarely give one star reviews, but this was rough.",

I happen to be staying at the hotel that's connected to the restaurant and it was a cold, rainy night, so I thoughts I'd stay in. \u00a0To sum things up, the food was good, not awesome, but good and the 4 stars were because of Patrick the bartender the night I visited. It was full, so I sat at the bar and was greeted by Patrick who was awesome. \u00a0No pushiness and very friendly even on a busy night. \u00a0I had a Makers Mark manhattan and checked out the menu. \u00a0I eat gluten free, so after browsing my options I settled on an item from the bar menu, the Hanger Steak. \u00a0After telling Patrick I was gluten free and knew I couldn't have the Fries, he checked with the kitchen and they'd suggested mashed potatoes. \u00a0Good to go. The meal was good, again, not awesome, but good and arrived in the right amount of time.  I appreciated Patrick's friendly help and will return the next time I'm staying nearby.",

It was a nice quiet retreat after the chaos of the museum.   I had the spicy chicken wrap with dressed greens and both were delicious.   I had iced tea with a splash of the pineapple mint lemonade and it was one of the most refreshing beverages ever!  Our waiter brought yummy focaccia bread to nibble on and to-go cookies as a little treat at the end.   I love a meal where I feel like I get everything I want.   This was one of those meals.   Bravo,  Bambara!",
