Like bad sick I kept trying to give them the benefit of the doubt but no it's their food alright. Maybe because the food isn't always covered correctly or maybe because ppl speak over and pass cash over the fish in front of their cash register, or maybe even the tongs and bowls could use a few cleanings throughout the day after so many ppl put their germ ridden fingers on them. Or because the fish sits out on ice all day long getting landed on by flies. I don't know but I do know I will not be going back.",
