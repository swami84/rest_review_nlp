I don't know why the other reviewer didn't like the crab cakes. I had the appetizer which was plenty for me as a meal. They were very thick, not short patties. The outside was crisp, the inside had a lot of crab meat lumps, not a ton of breading like some places. The remoulade had a slight kick that made it taste amazing together. So, I guess it depends what you want out of a crab cake. I'm from New England, and I think these were perfect. Again, maybe the main course is different than the appetizer. I had great service when I was in the restaurant, the staff was attentive and friendly.",

Jerard was also very helpful in providing me information on some of the ingredients and hours of operation. I will definitely be visiting again. They offer healthy foods that are \"mindful\", vegan or vegetarian. If you're in the area, be sure to stop by. They also have a daily rotating menu. I highly recommend.",

The service was completely unacceptable due to a lack of attention or care for customers. They were not busy, they were not understaffed, our waitress was just straight up bad.  We were in the city and saw that this place was on the list of restaurants participating in Restaurant Week. So we thought we would give it a try since the items on their $20 lunch menu for the week sounded really good. Well, we walked in and no one knew what we were talking about when we mentioned Restaurant Week. I had to pull it up on my phone and they had to then take my phone to show the manager. The hostess came back with 1 menu for us to share. When our waitress approached us she looked at us, didn't introduce herself or anything, all she said was \"order?\". Because we were still thinking about a main course, we put in the orders for our first course - 2 crab bisques. Soon after we entered that order, the hotess came back to take the menu from us to give to another table. Still baffled at how they only had 1 menu. Anyways, it took 20 minutes before our waitress came over with only 1 crab bisque. She gave it to my boyfriend and he brought up that I had gotten one as well. Her response was \"oh, I thought you were sharing\". She then assured us that she would bring out another. At this point, we gave her our selection for the main course. Another 20 minutes pass and we were still waiting on the other crab bisque, meanwhile we had seen our waitress multiple times. So I finally got up and asked her to please bring the other crab bisque we ordered. She had another waitress bring it out for us. Finally, we had our two starters and were patiently waiting for our meals. The waitress brought over two sandwhiches that were not ours. The worst part to me is that I had touched the sandwich placed in front of me and lifted the bun and everything to confirm it was not mine. When she realized who the order belonged to, she took it directly to the other table and served it, after I had my hands all in it. That's when we found out that our order had not even been put in yet!!!! We had been there for over an hour at this point. The manager must have noticed that we were upset and came over to check on us. So we told him the truth and asked to cancel our order because we were leaving, and that's what we did. So why the 2 stars? The crab bisque was actually really good and the manager was very apologetic and did not have us pay for our soups.",

I later found out multiple dishes from different people (Fried chicken, mac and cheese, meatballs, etc.) Had also been sent back. So it was nothing new. They gave me a refund which was expected, and were very polite about the whole thing, which is why they are receiving 2 stars and not just 1.
