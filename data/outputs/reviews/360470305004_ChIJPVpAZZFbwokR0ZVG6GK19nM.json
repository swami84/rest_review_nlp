Had held back as it's a bit pricey but boy was it ultimately worth it. Had the Smoked Tea Salad, Fish Curry, and chickpea gravy noodles and all were wonderful and unique, we are still reminiscing 24 hours later. I hope the latter will be added to the permanent menu. Ordered delivery and all food held up in the journey. Looking forward to sampling again, even in person one of these days (hoping outdoor seating is dog friendly!)",

So I felt that paying $14 just for a plate of romaine is kind of too much. The main courses are also expensivethan they should be, but those are good quality food, so its still ok.",

There was another gentleman (maybe a bartender, with a beard) that was friendly and professional as well. Kudos to them for putting this experience over the top for my friends and i!  Food/Drinks: 8/10 The meatballs and salad with fried sweet potato were very tasty. I probably could have gone there and ordered a few rounds of the meatballs for just myself. I ordered the fish curry and it had a great flavor, but it was nothing extraordinary or over the top memorable for me. The drinks however were excellent and very unique!  Value: 3/5 Unfortunatley this place carries the pop up vibe. Limited menu, smaller portions, higher prices. 2 appetizers split between three people with an entree, and splitting a dessert three ways was just enough to keep me satisfied for the night. One drink a piece and our totals came out to about $60 per person before tip. The portion sizes are fair but for $20-27 entree range, in my perfect world, i was hoping for a little more. Even the rice bowls were fairly skimpy. For the quality of the food, service, and location, i think overall the value of this establishment is fair.  Service: 5/5 No real comments other than exceptional service from the two gentleman listed above. They had knowledge of the gluten free items and different ways to prepare them. They were funny, friendly, and everything else was perfect!  Experience: 4/5 I am unaware of what outdoor seating may exist outdoors in the back, but we were say in the front under a newly built cove of some sorts. It was finished just before we arrived! It had space heaters and a roof. Beautiful flower decore.  If you\u2019re in the area, definitely a place to check out. For me, the prospect and crown heights areas have a lot more to offer that I have been excited about",

I think that was very rude of you.  Josey  11 hours ago We had a very strange interaction with the  owner/manager Daniel. Not going to a place where I do not feel welcomed. Disappointing because I was excited to try the food Like  Share Response from the owner 5 hours ago Sorry you feel that way. Anymore details about the interaction? Was it about me not taking your name down for a waitlist because we were already overbooked? As you can see in so many other reviews we pride ourselves on the friendliness of our service and our welcoming attitude. But like all other social interaction, these things go both ways. There is a single other negative review (on Yelp) about the service and it was precisely about issues with being on a waitlist versus having a reservation. Our reservations have priority and when we do a waitlist it's when we think there is a chance to accommodate people without a reservation. Since that review, I have been very careful about putting people on a waitlist as it seems to sometimes create confusion and people get mad when a reservation gets seated in front of them after they have been put on a waitlist. I always try to say yes, but it has sometimes backfired and I'm starting to no. So far the only issues we've had about our service in general as been related to the waitlist and people feeling entitled to it or from it. We try to do the right thing by everyone but sometimes it's just not possible. I wish it didn't have to be this way and that you can forgive me for making you feel unwelcomed. If you change your mind, try to make a reservation and hopefully everything will be much smoother. -Daniel",

The real show-stopper was the lemongrass fish soup, with its oozy boiled eggs and crunchy sweet fried onion fritter. The dried shrimp relish with slices of cucumbers was great on its own drizzled with lime, but also a nice fishy salty accent to the curry and soup. Even the plain white rice was cooked to perfection.
