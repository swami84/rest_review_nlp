I came in one hour to close so I'm not sure if the employees were restless or simply having a bad day. I requested my fries to be freshly dropped because there were barley any left. The lady told me it would be a wait and I said it was fine I would wait and she dropped the fries in the oil. As my bowl moved down the line the employee who was making my food switched. the tall brown guy began serving me. When I asked for the bread behind him because there were only two cold pieces left he told me \"its the same bread\" okay then give me the one I requested? Im not sure why it has to be an argument when I just prefer the warm fresh bread. Moving forward I asked for a little bit of peppers  and he literally gave me TWO peppers????? moving forward when we get to the register I TOLD him I was also getting the fries behind him that were just made.. When I moved for two seconds to get an extra sauce he snuck and got me the old fries and put them in my bag. When I told him why did he just do that he lied and said he hadn't and that theyre all the same fries? but I literally just waited extra time for the fries so what is the problem? is money going to come out of your check if I'm given what I was told I would get? fresh fries? honestly its just annoying. and the food was bland and the sauce tasted like watered down ranch!

You have the option to add sides including hummus, baba ganouj, falafel, or fries to your order. For drinks, they have Coca Cola beverages and bottled beverages.  I ordered the combo platter. This platter consisted of orange colored rice, chicken and gyro meat, lettuce, tomato, kalamata olives, and their signature white sauce. I felt that it could have had more white sauce than what was provided. It was glad that my friend requested white sauce on the side so they came in packets and was able to add more to my platter. I was on the fence to add hummus but I'm glad I did. For signing up for the rewards program, I got a complimentary fountain soda and side. The wavy fries were crispy and tasted fresh.",
