Great prices, big portions, and a no-contact ordering/delivery/pickup process. Who could ask for more these days?  I usually order a shrimp lo mein and chicken and broccoli for pickup, and it's ready within 10 minutes. The first time I went to pick up, when I got there I was happy to see robust protection for the staff and customers in these crazy quarantine times. There's a plastic tarp and a pickup box so there is no contact the entire time. If you pay with card, you use a little slot in the tarp, and if you pay with cash you use the box to the side.  Receipts and change also go through the box.  The food itself was tasty, flavorful, tender, and exactly what you're looking for when you want Chinese take-out. Seriously -- the brown sauce hit the spot! The lo mein noodles were perfectly cooked, and even though I got the small size the shrimp to noodle ratio was very generous. The chicken and broccoli was also perfectly seasoned and a good size for the small. I only paid $15 for the food and two drinks!  Check this place out if you want to satisfy your craving for Chinese takeout. It's worth it.",
