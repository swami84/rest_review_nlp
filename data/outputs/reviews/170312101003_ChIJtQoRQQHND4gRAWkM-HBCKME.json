The main dishes the night we went were Hake for the fish and Pork Loin for the meat. The pork was great but the Hake was just out of this world. Perfectly poached (I think) with a tangy but not too strong horseradish sauce. In addition to the four listed courses they brought three \"surprise\" tastes, a miso broth, trout fritters, and ground venison on greens. All very tasty. Portions were just the right size; you leave satisfied but not feeling like you've overeaten despite 7 or 8 dishes. I will definitely return.",

We were seated 15 minutes after our initial reservation. That aside, the food was tasty and interesting, but, as some others have said, pricey for what we got. Highlights were the fjord trout (amazing); blue grits and \u201cham\u201d; the initial \u201csnacks\u201d (one was a fried mashed potato croquette); and the fennel palate cleanser. The dessert, a baked alaska, was good but not amazing. I was disappointed most of all in the duck dish. Despite the flavor profile being great, the fat on the duck was not rendered and it was very tough and chewy, to the point I had to spit some bites out. This just is not up to par with their other food or their sister restaurant, Parachute. We also noticed that we were skipped over for one of the appetizers - some sort of soup. Overall, we think perhaps the Valentine\u2019s Day rush impeded our experience, so left feeling a bit underwhelmed for the price, but we will consider returning on a less busy day.",

        "caption": "First important note: menu changes daily, so this was my experience with the $85 NYE menu. Your experience will vary!  Second note: I was initially concerned that the portion sizes were going to be small and we would leave hungry. That was not the case.  4 course prix fixe with several mini courses peppered between meant we were both satisfied.  That being said, before we could order drinks, we had two of these mini courses on our table plus a basket of artisan bread. One of these was hot and losing temp as we figured out what to drink. Each time the courses were delivered, the description was quietly mentioned and that person darted back to the kitchen. While our primary server was great (helpful, detailed and pleasant), they had a lot of tables to cover in a crowded restaurant so we didn\u2019t see them often.  Overall, the service really detracted from the quality of the meal.  Our oysters were tasty but still attached to shell (and we had no utensils) so was hard to eat initially. I had to detach with my finger.  I believe the second mini dish was a Yorkshire pudding (couldn\u2019t hear well) which was a bit eggy. I won\u2019t pretend to be an expert of British cooking, but the eggy bread dough + the light cream cheese spread meant that you really just tasted egg.  The bread itself was amazing. I assume it was baked in house because it tasted like one of those loaves that could support a restaurant of its own like Tartine with a cult following like Nancy Silverton or Peter Reinhart.  Great crust, delicate interior and rich earthy flavor. Unfortunately the individual who was slicing the bread was crushing the crumb as they sliced so it ended up smashed in our bread basket. This may sound like a nitpick (and it is) but if you\u2019re going to go through the trouble of providing fantastic artisan bread, you really should slice it properly.  Bouillabaisse was surprisingly good for me because I\u2019m not big on intense fish flavors.  This was strong but balanced nicely by the pepper and tarragon - I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Celeriac course was nice. Solid presentation and hit the right savory notes.  Black cod marinated in beet juice was my favorite of the night. The fish was incredibly delicate but had a light crust on it so you had some contrasting textures. Portabellas and (I think) chard were also great.  The main course was a wagyu bavette served with some mysterious sauce with celery strands on it. The sauce and celery were great on their own. But I didn\u2019t find that they paired well with the beef. I think the sauce would have paired better with chicken or maybe duck breast because of how sweet it was. The beef wasn\u2019t the star of the show and it should have been. It was a nice tender cut, but had little flavor itself and didn\u2019t fit in that dish with the sweet sauce.  Side note: if you need to explain to each customer how to use the steak knife, it might be time to buy new knives.  We added the daily cheese plate which was a nice assortment of 3 cheeses. The cranberry spread that was served with the crisps was good for palette cleansing between cheeses but didn\u2019t compliment the cheeses itself when combined.  Last, we had 3 separate desserts of varying size that were unique and satisfying. I myself enjoyed all three (hay ice cream, kings cake w/cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and a one bite tart with some citrus curd), but my wife wasn\u2019t into the more unique flavors (she disliked the ice cream).  Overall, the dishes didn\u2019t land for the two of us. Some (black cod) were enjoyable but there weren\u2019t enough wow moments. The beef was also a big miss for me.  Coupled with the other few pieces and the jarring service, we were a bit disappointed for an all in $350 check (again, NYE, we added a few drinks and the cheese courses).  For that size of check, I expected a more cohesive menu with fewer missteps.  Because it\u2019s a set course, it\u2019s hard to tell your server you didn\u2019t enjoy a dish and ask for something else.  Would try again considering they have something new each night but will wait a bit before returning.",

They\u2019ve made remarkable use of a relatively small room to provide ample seating without feeling crowded. Service was attentive and rarely left us wanting. The food was a delight, with vegetarian, octopus, and iberico ham collar courses and a baked apple dessert supplemented with 3 small bite warm ups and palette cleansers. While the seafood and ham were perfectly cooked and balanced dishes, I\u2019d reflect that if all veg focused dishes were as perfectly delicious as theirs I\u2019d live a happy vegetarian life. The wine pairings were a surprise as well. At this price point you can\u2019t expect them to lean into the grand crus and rarities of the world. Instead, they found modest wines which you might not always choose to sit and sip alone, but which complimented the food in a way that elevated both. I\u2019ve been to multi Michelin starred places which couldn\u2019t get wine right, but these guys nailed it. A brilliant experience overall.",
