We had to get our drinks from the bar because no one took our order, just flopped a menu on our table on their way to another. We were never even greeted. The waitress in our section ignored us completely while waiting on the booths to our left and right. They got their food, we still went unacknowledged. It's a shame because our drink and food order normally nets a good tip for good service. We walked out without eating. We won't be back.",
