The food is delicious, reasonably priced, promptly prepared and the staff have been friendly.  Two of my favourites are the Tom Yum soup and Co Co shrimp.

There was only one othe party in the restaurant,  but I accepted the table. There were no condiments on the table and I wasn't offered any. Nor was I given Chopsticks,  my utensil of choice. The redeeming factor was the food. It was served promptly,  arrived hot and it was delicious. It was much to large a portion for me, and taking it home was no problem. The prices were very reasonable I would go back again for lunch if alone.",

I tried it again last year (after many years in between visits)  and found the food lackluster, but did enjoy the Crispy Shrimp which I have ordered several times since.  I thought I'd give it another try now that its been about 18 months since the disappointing in-restaurant experience.  The food is actually INEDIBLE!  The Crispy Shrimp was undercooked, while I suspect that both the curry samosas and fried pork dumplings were left over from yesterday and re-fried.  If not that, they are simply way overcooked, perhaps in stale oil.  The samosa are so tough that I literally cannot eat them.  The dumplings are also overcooked producing very tough skins.  I won't be reordering again.",

The stir fried dishes have great flavors, and are never too greasy. They also include a generous amount of veggie - yum! I also like to get their roti canai to start the meal. Love their coconut rice. Nice to see the health food mix and match offering as well.  Staff is always friendly. Price is very reasonable. Great value!",
