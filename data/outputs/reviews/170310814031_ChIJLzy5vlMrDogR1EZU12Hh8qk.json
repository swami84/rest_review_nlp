But, when I am outlaying cash for an experience, I am looking for value in exchange of hard-earned money.   You must know that as you make reservations here, you pay $20.00 per person and this is NOT applied to your check, it is a fee that you just pay.  I am a business owner and I get profit, but this fee is crazy. The gals that greet you are discriminating at best, they look you up and down and then to the seating chart to decide where they are going to seat you.  Since I, along with everyone else prefers a window seat, I simply requested a window seat, they have a second row of seating off the windows in a crowded, not Covid friendly dining area.  We were escorted to the back of the restaurant to a window seat, across for the staff who were eating there.  GREAT, not! As a seasoned business owner, a woman of means and a Chicagoan my whole life, I knew I was being retaliated against for asking for another seat, because I had a seat overlooking the sewage treatment plant and the roof exhaust. Absolutely no view \u2026 The only thing good about the meal was the salad, the rest subpar, lukewarm, no taste and the wine is a cheap table wine with no flavor and $15.00 a glass. This Restaurant is old, smelly and in a bad need of a renovation; the chairs are so old, they are covered with a fabric that kept falling off, when were they washed last?  The vide is 1960\u2019s gold, with our $400.00 check/bill, you need to reinvest. Tsk Tsk If you make reservations at The Signature Room in the Handcock Building, you\u2019ll have a better experience.",

I was quickly seated and the views of the city were breathtaking. My waitress suggested several dishes, and she was very excited for me to be dining with them. I told her I\u2019d pretty much leave the food up to her recommendations. She suggested the escargot (delicious), the salmon (it was wild caught, and an absolute delicacy), and I finished my night with a very thoughtfully crafted chocolate dessert that I am still dreaming about. The wine I chose was also excellent, and the entire experience was memorable.  I\u2019m not sure why so many people had a negative experience here, but mine was amazing and I would not hesitate to go back!",

We were celebrating our anniversary and told that Cite offered a special experience that required us to prepay for our dinner in advance. They charge $179 per person and we received service equivalent to a mid-level restaurant chain or less. First of all, there was 1 employee working the entire restaurant who was very difficult to understand or communicate with. It\u2019s clear he was over extended working all the tables, the bar and host stand. We were seated next to a table that was definitely less than 6 feet away. When we called Cindy upon booking the reservation, she assured us that the restaurant was serious about practicing social distancing. This was not the case. When we asked to order alcoholic beverages, the waiter was reluctant to take our orders stating that he had no way of accepting payment and that we would have to write sensitive credit card info down on a piece of paper. This was highly unprofessional. My husband asked for a scotch list. He said they didn\u2019t have one and instructed us to walk to the bar and take a look at the bottles. He also made it clear that he was not the bartender and could only make simple drinks. I\u2019ve never experienced this type of bar service at an \u201cupscale restaurant\u201d. The food was underwhelming. The lobster bisque was a bit bland and lukewarm. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was fine, but our entrees were the most disappointing. We were specifically told to refer to the menu online which listed filet mignon as one of the main entree options. When it came time to order it, the waiter told us that only the NY strip was available and not the filet. This was ridiculous. There is a quality and price disparity between a filet and NY strip and furthermore if we had known it was not an option up front we might have gone to another restaurant. The salmon was also over cooked and a bit tough. We paid for our dinners well in advance where there should have been enough food for us to be able to choose from all the options. I felt like this was poor planning on the kitchen\u2019s part. In addition to the poor dining experience, there were multiple people in pajamas and casual clothing just waltzing in to take photos of the view. When the waiter asked if they were there for dinner, they stated they lived in the building and apparently this was justification enough to interrupt our dinner to loiter in the dining room and talk to their friends and take pictures. It just seemed a bit ridiculous that a dinner priced this high would have such a casual ambiance and multiple interruptions. Overall, we had high expectations for celebrating our anniversary here and we\u2019re deeply disappointed. This is not the type of experience they should be advertising as upscale.",

Now due to Covid they offer a 3 course prefix menu which must be prepaid in order to keep your reservation( not a problem). We chose package #1 $179pp tax and tip included not alcoholic beverage but a  cash bar would be available. Our reservation was for 8pm we arrived a little late (15-20min) and was rudely told you know we close at 10pm (of course we do it\u2019s a city ordinance). However, the time we arrived is irrelevant when our entire meal is completely pre-paid. Not to mention it\u2019s only 3 courses which doesn\u2019t take long to eat. Once seated we tried to order drinks and was told there is no bartender *side eye * website says cash bar available. Our server can barely speak English but is very accommodating by trying to make basic drinks. We\u2019re then informed they can\u2019t take cash and we have to write our credit card number on a piece of paper so they can charge us the next day. Apparently there\u2019s only the server and chef working and no cash register I guess. We were a party of four and ordered the lobster bisque, (2) Alaskan salmon, (2) New York Strips, and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The lobster bisque was mixed reviews I found it lacking and bland whereas my husband thought it great. Both the Salmon were a little overcooked, dry, and tasteless but the couscous was very flavorful. The steaks and fingerling potato were tender with one being more savory than the other. The highlight of the evening was the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which DID NOT disappoint. Rich, creamy custard with the right amount of crispness and very fresh raspberries atop.  All in all the meal was definitely not worth the price nor was the experience. When we had called the lady kept referring to the Cit\u2019e experience and if that was suppose to be it it was extremely lackluster. The service was okay and food subpar. Not to mention groups of the general public kept coming in to take pictures of the view. They sold a private elegant affair and it was nothing of the sort. Save yourself time and money there plenty of other places where u can get amazing service and better food for $900 bill after drinks.",

My fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t been able to celebrate NYE is 10 years due to her working in the food and beverage industry and usually has to work. She was finally off and we were able to finally celebrate together. We bought last minute tickets for $250 each for a 6 course meal.y fianc\u00e9 is pregnant and the food needed to be prepared a certain way which we specified in the beginning. They brought the soup out which was cold but we decided to eat it anyways. Next was the duck that we said needed to be well done for her. They brought it out medium rare so we sent it back to be re cooked. They left my duck and we waited about 10-15 min for her new one to come out.  I waited to eat mine and by the time hers came out mine was cold and never offered to give me a new one or take it when they took hers. Next was our steaks. Hers came out rare. Again we sent it back. They took the same meat and cooked it longer which took another 10-15 min longer. It still was medium rare when she got it. They also didn\u2019t offer to bring me a new one as I waited for hers to come out do we weren\u2019t eating alone. Last was our dessert. We order a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a cheese cake. They brought out a fondue. So we had to send that back and wait for the correct dessert. All in all we couldn\u2019t enjoy our time together because we were continuously complaining and sending things back. Not once did a manager come to talk to us. I called a couple days later to explain the situation and the lady manager I spoke with said she would help us out and talk to the owner. I never received a call back and called again. They said they needed more time and said they probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything and that she still wasn\u2019t able to talk to the owner. I have been trying to call a few times a week and now they are ignoring my calls. Their customer service especially from a management stand point as been very unprofessional.",

(Original) Het uitzicht vanaf de 72e verdieping waarop het restaurant is gesitueerd is bij avond ongelooflijk mooi. Heel Downtown Chicago ligt aan je voeten. Het eten en de wijnen zijn ook nog eens van uitstekende kwaliteit. Neem een dikke portemonnee mee want het is ronduit duur. Maar gewoon doen wanneer je in Chicago bent.

The only thing you pay for is the view which you can get in other places for this price besides quality food and service. We went there for NYE dinner and first of all, the service was super slow! We were sitted on the table around 8 and finished the menu around 11:45!! Had to wait too long after each course until the server finally came to ask if we\u2019re ready for the next course. The steak was overcooked, dry and even burnt on top! The duck breast was almost raw and the salad dressing was not tasty at all. There was a light piano music until midnight and silence after that! They gave us champagne 30 minutes before the midnight but there was no music, count down or any NY flare at midnight which seems something pretty normal and easy for most bars and restaurants to organize.",

We were seated right away at a table with a magnificent view. The bus boy filled our water right away as soon as we sat down. It took our waiter approximately 15 minutes to take our drink order. He had an attitude and was not friendly at all. After waiting another 15-20 minutes, we still had not received our drinks. We asked to have the waiter come to our table  in which he did. We inquire where our drinks were and he was extremely rude and said the bartender was behind on drinks. Mind you, the restaurant was not even very busy. I had told him this was my mother's birthday and that the service for an upscale restaurant was not acceptable.  He could care less as to the situation and offered no resolve. I told him when I made the reservation that it was for a celebration and they said they would have a menu made with my mothers name and offered a piece of cake in honor of her birthday. He stated they didn't have the menu made. I asked to speak to a manager and he said he was one of them. I told him he acted extremely unprofessional and had ruined our evening and we would NEVER return again. We got up and left the restaurant. It was appalling the way we were treated and the lack of care that he showed to us. The city has a plethora of upscale restaurants that have views like Cite that will treat you with dignity and respect. Do not waste your time and money going to Cite where the staff has no regards for you. Thanks Cite for ruining my mother's birthday. You have lost a repeat customer for life!",

I also made it a point to say it was our anniversary and considering what we were paying, figured we\u2019d be offered a champagne toast or just something to make it a little more special. We got the chilled sea food platter (which comes with 4 pieces of the smallest oysters and shrimp I\u2019ve ever seen), the scallop risotto, filet, asparagus and fondue for dessert- I had two glasses of Cannonball Cab, $300 later I was wishing we\u2019d have gone to Coopers Hawk and saved our money.

We wanted to celebrate our little staycation in the city. We were 5 minutes early for our reservations, ended up waiting for 20 minutes in the tiny vestibule as we were not allowed at the bar with two small children, ages 5 and 3, who were really excited to see the fireworks.  We had excellent views!  But that's all the restaurant has going for it.  The service is horrible.  Upon getting seated, it took them 30min to bring bread.  20 MORE minutes to take our DRINK orders.  By that time the fireworks have already ended.  The wait-staff couldn't be found.  We had to stop random personnel to ask to be waited on.  After that, a person came over asking why we haven't placed our food orders yet - because no one asked.  Then two waiters started pointing fingers at each other, saying \"he was supposed to take your order, no he was, no I wasn't...\". Anyway, long story short, our table turned out to be unassigned to a waiter and so we were left without service for close to an hour, at which point it was time to take the kids for bed as it was getting really late.  We never ended up trying the food there.  We did enjoy a bottle of wine, which the waiter told us to \"ENJOY\", sarcastically, after we asked to speak to the manager of the facility. The manager never arrived, probably because no one related the message to him/her. We couldn't wait any longer, so we left to put our children to bed, who were hungry but patient through it all.  I was impressed. Needless to say we will never come back to try their food, as there are many other restaurants in Chicago.  I would not recommend this place besides maybe a few drinks at the bar during fireworks.",

My poor, sweet husband wanted to do something special for me for my birthday seeing as it fell on the weekend of the Air and Water Show; he saw Cite offered a viewing and brunch for $85/ pp prepaid brunch, so he jumped on it. Our reservation was for 12:15, we got there at 12:17, and it was a bizarre experience from the moment we stepped out of the elevator. We waited awkwardly at the host stand for 10-15 mins with an occasional \"photographer\" coming by saying the hostess will be right with us. Someone finally comes and for being advertised as an \"upscale\" restaurant, the hostess was dressed SUPER casually (literally in athletic leggings) and EXTREMELY frazzled. She told us they didn't have our table ready and they were, \"trying to kick people out to make room for us.\" Huh?? She rushed us to the bar, where we sat with several other guests also waiting for tables, who also had reservations they prepaid for. Well, 2 terrible drinks ($35), and an HOUR later, my husband was about to lose it. This was not the birthday he expected for me. He goes up to the host stand asking if we can get refunded, and some extremely rude gentleman just walks up and says, \"did he mention a refund? Nope, sorry, no refunds.\" My husband being the accountant he is said, \"then I will dispute this with Chase because the promised services were not delivered and this is fraud.\" He walked away to get me to leave, and 1 minute later, the frazzled hostess came to seat us. She sat us next to the kitchen with a huge external exhaust fan next to us. We were starving at this point, and so badly wanted to salvage the day, so we sat down. We had no water and had to have the bartender tell us where the buffet was since he saw us awkwardly sitting there. We went to the buffet, and I swear, it was like a buffet from a continental breakfast at a hotel chain. Yes, they had shrimp, and some really weird meat they labeled as \"lump crab meat\"  and a carving station, but all of these premium items were of the absolute worst and disgusting quality. The shrimp especially was so slimy and soggy. As we sat and picked at our food, we were so thirsty. My husband asked a fleeting waiter for water, and he told us to go to the bartender and ask. WHAT??? That was the last straw. We asked for our check and although we prepaid 85 per person, for what was the WORST dining experience of my life, we got charged a service fee and some other booking fee. WHAT SERVICE?? To top off the terrible and bizarre service, as we were about to step on the elevator to leave, the hostesses say, \"thank you for being so easy and leaving right away, we like people like you.\" It was such a strange \"compliment,\" and we left there baffled. Clearly, this place is outdated, can't keep up with the amazing culinary competition in the city, and should not be open any longer if they can't get the hint about their terrible service.",

Our reservation was at 930 which we showed up early and our seats were given away as a mistake by the front desk. We sat down around 9:40pm at a different location then initially discussed and arranged then we were moved again from our spot to watch the firework show. We watched the whole show until 10;30pm without even the waiter coming to our table and serving us. That\u2019s when me and my fianc\u00e9 got up and complained to Keith which was professional and offered 2 gift certificates to be sent in the mail. Have not received yet. But overall horrible experience and I\u2019m hoping to come again without this debacle of supposedly to be an enjoyable dinner with my fianc\u00e9e.  I\u2019d like to add that Keith Was professional and friendly and apologetic!!!!",

Thats not really the restaurants fault so we looked past it. Then we sat down and no one served us for 35 minutes. I even tried calling for servers multiple times and was ignored. For a restaurant of such caliber and no one even served us or acknowledged us? Ridiculous. 35 minutes was enough and we walked out. Let the front hosts know, and they had the audacity to offer us a \"complimentary dessert.\" Are you kidding me? I've worked as a server at Chilis and we offered to pick up entire tabs for a delayed entree to the table. AT CHILIS we offered this, and this place offered us a complimentary dessert. Anyways we ended up going to Bandera on Michigan Ave. Bandera served us the way you would expect a well run restaurant to be. I would recommend Bandera Restaurant to anyone. We came all the way from Denver and had chosen this for our big dinner. Thanks for ruining that. I'm sure Cite is a fine restaurant, the view is amazing. However, for us, it was a terrible experience. So I won't recommend it for anyone.",

My youngest daughter caught the Happy Hour Special right before it ended - Double Mini Cheese Burgers accompanied by some Great Fries.

Only one person is getting the cars. My turn finally comes and I am told that I went over my allotted time by 10 minutes and must now pay the full $39.00 to park there. I explained that I was waiting in line for over ten minutes and was told that it was automated and there was nothing that could be done.  That was enough for me to never return to Cite.

Not in room temperature at least. There was a soup I don't what it is not definitely not lobster. They didn't even ask if I would want to eat pork. Serve us some kind of pre prepared won ton looking appetizer which we resend. Waiters described like he doesn't eat lamb and he doesn't know how and which temperature chef prepares. Steak was cold we had to rearm it. Then you can imagine what kind of shoe sole you eat. I have to be honest with you though wherever they got the chocolate cake was fresh.

The servers were very nice and the food was good (could have been a little better for the price). Seemed like food you would expect at a high end place...during the 90s and previous years. But culinary expectations have come a long way and I think the menu needs a little refresh or at least a refresh on plating. The taste was good though. Nothing to complain about there. The only other thing was the layout was a big circle and we were up against the interior wall and it seemed like a server trolley was passing by us every 10 seconds. Sounds like I complained a lot but it wasnt anything that was a deal breaker!",

No air conditioning - why you get to sit in 40 degree heat, because it's like a greenhouse. In addition, the service is so poor that one thinks it is a lie. 2 dishes came without side dishes before a quarter of an hour later. So the choice was between letting the food get cold or eating the accompaniment alone afterwards. They forgot a dish, and we were then accused of it was because it was a cumbersome order. When we had to pay we went up to the counter but were ordered down in place but still ended up having to pay at the counter. It's an expensive place, but poorly maintained and the waiters walked around in stained clothes - you do not do that at those prices. An evening ruined due to heat stroke and poor service.  (Original) Aldrig oplevet noget s\u00e5 forf\u00e6rdeligt. Overvejer I denne restuarent, s\u00e5 lad v\u00e6re. Udsigten er god, men du kommer ikke til at nyde den. Ingen aircondition - hvorfor du kommer til at sidde i 40 graders varme, for det er som et drivhus. Derudover er servicen s\u00e5 ringe, at man tror det er l\u00f8gn. 2 retter kom uden tilbeh\u00f8r f\u00f8r et kvarter senere. S\u00e5 valget stod mellem at lade maden blive kold eller spise tilbeh\u00f8ret alene bagefter. En ret glemte de, og vi blev herefter beskyldt for, det var pga det var en besv\u00e6rlig bestilling. Da vi skulle betale gik vi op til disken, men blev beordret ned p\u00e5 plads, men endte alligevel med at skulle betale ved disken. Det er eg dyrt sted, men misvedligeholdt og tjenerne gik rundt i plettet t\u00f8j - det g\u00f8r man ikke til de priser. En aften \u00f8delagt pga hedeslag og d\u00e5rlig betjening.",

No air was flowing.   We were there for my birthday and I knew it was expensive but the menu had changed and increased from what is posted on line.   First of all my napkin had stains on it, there were bugs outside the window (not their fault) but it made me itchy and thinking they were inside.  OK   My Cosmo came without a lime twist and wasn't very good They never asked or told me what kind of vodka they used.  OK  We ordered a $22 appetizer platter for the table of 4 with prawns and oysters.  Naked oysters and good sized prawns.   There were 2 prawns and 2 oysters   VERY expensive.  OK  the mixed salad wasn't special and the dressing had too much dijon mustard in it.  OK   One person ordered a pork chop  It was thick and came with some apple dressing  $37.00 but it was good no sides.  One ordered Scallops $40.00 for THREE scallops with rissoto.  One person ordered Barramundi  fish small fish we doubt it was really Barramundi no sides $39 and the pieces de resistance is I ordered Lobster tail for $70.  It was dry and chewy.  It came with some dry layered potatoes I couldn't eat.   The chef came and said he could make a new one fast.   15 minutes later when everyone was done eating it appeared.   Same as first one.   Birthday ruined.  Great view and ambiance.   Don't go",

We did not have a reservation but they said we had to wait for a table to open.did you no there were seats on the south side of the restaurant but from my understanding they really don't sit nobody because it's just the south side of chicago. That was offending. I'm from the south side.from a good neighborhood. And i also thought that view was better Never will return to this HIGH CLASS DUMP.oh ya this the Southside of the restaurant as u can see it had at least 25 empty tables. JUST SAD",

I asked the server to please bring another one and it was the same thing could't drink it. After that i asked for a plate that was jn promotion since my husband and i didn't know what to eat. It was supposelly 32 oz steak. I would say that it was 12 oz steak and the rest was bone. That's it. I asked to be well done and i got it raw. At the end i was expecting such a great night with my family and i ended up doing this review since i dont like doing reviews good or bad ablut any place. But well. I am just dissappointed.",

I would\u2019ve had and have had btw a better experience at red lobster. We were served mashed potatoes and one of the dinner guests asked if they were real. The server replied they were but when I tasted them it was clear they were not! How do you pay $75 for crab legs (which should\u2019ve been served with butter) and are then served box potatoes! The steak was tough and had no seasoning, thank God they had steak sauce. Then the bathroom, the bathroom smelled horrible. I literally stood for a moment wondering which stall to take. I was just that hesitant to go but my bladder wouldn\u2019t allow for the wait lol smh... Just a huge let down overall and I will never, ever, step foot in this place again!",

As we entered , the host was friendly but our server (amir) wasnt good. First, he didnt introduce himself and he just gave the wine menu to my husband without explaining the wine or the food menu. Then we ordered the 32 oz rib eye medium. The rib eye was exteremely chewy and it was 32 oz with the huge bone. We each had 3 pieces of meat which was chewy with no flavor. The server( amir) didnt even bother to come once to ask how was our food. After the food was done, we sat 10 min till someone else came and picked up our plates. He was chatting with the host and when he saw i looked at him , he brought the dessert menu without saying one word about the dessert or if we were happy with the food.  At last he charged us 20% tips without even telling us which in their menu it said we charge 20% for party of 6, but we were just two people. After he charged us, my husband asked why you charged 20% and he just said i can take it off if you want. He didnt even say thank you for coming. The one star i gave just represent the view which i could have had it with 30bucks instead of 200 bucks. Not recommanded.",
