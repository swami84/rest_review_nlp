Haven't been over here since the original hispanic food restaurant closed. None the less. Was fortunate enough to get the rooftop seating. Weather was perfect. Service was quick. Portions and food are good. I highly recommend the rum bbq wings and the jerk chicken entree. Also the bucket margarita was good. Wished it was more Frozen but it tasted good regardless",

We were seated in the center of the floor by the host station and no way we could not be seen. The host seated us with no menus. We waited 15 minutes no menu, no alcohol, no server to come greet us. As we waited we watched two women congregated at the host station with nothing to do but watch us and several other servers walk around. We finally grab someone attention and they just said okay and walked away to get someone. More time passed by and a guy came over to greet us. We have already pulled up the menu on our phones because we were starving and thirsty at this point. He took our orders and we waited for another 15 minutes and no water or drinks at our tablr. Eventually we just got up and left. This place must been lacking management as too many people working here and the restaurant is not at full capacity!",

Finally, one of them took our order but seemed to be under the influence or was really hung over - had difficulty with everything! A few people waited for a while to get their attention, and left when no one showed any interest. Pity, since its such a great location!",

It's not crazy obvious from the ground, but they have a cool rooftop bar that was jumping.  Our server was great, attentive but not smothering, extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  My partner got shrimp (steamed, but chilled is also an option) and the fish tacos (which come with a salad or fries - she loved the honey/lime dressing) and I had the hot wings and the Cuban. She liked all of her food and I liked my wings. The only knock on this place was the Cuban. I'm from Tampa and I can be a bit snobby about Cuban sandwiches, so maybe I'm being overly critical, but I felt like it needed more mustard, the shredded pork was the wrong flavor/consistency, the ham was a bit too thick, and the bread smelled/tasted a bit like burnt oil.  My partner also got (and loved) the dark and stormy, which was also pretty reasonably priced.  Overall, the vibe was cool, the rooftop was fun, the service was great. I'll definitely be back, I just won't get the Cuban.",
