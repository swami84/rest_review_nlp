The wings were ok, the sauces were solid, but everything else was an actual disaster. The rib tips were so tough they were basically inedible. The green beans were a pile of mush with no flavor. The mac n cheese was not at all cheesy and had no flavor. The banana pudding I ordered didn\u2019t even make it in the bag so I can\u2019t judge that.

But that didn\u2019t make the best option. Ok, the food: got a sampler, first time here. Rib tips were the only great thing. Cooked properly. Brisket - good, nothing special, tho. The rib bones were the worst - too much spice rub, dry *and* mushy texture - being overcooked. The \u2018burnt ends\u2019 were neither burned nor what I think of as ends. Just a large piece of brisket that was cut into chunks, but not re-smoked, or anything. At least nit drowned in sauce, as I\u2019ve experienced elsewhere. Had Mac and cheese, very picky here, but it was great! Except so salty, almost inedible. Otherwise, great unique flavor and creamy. Potato salad unmemorable, not my favorite style, too-big potato pieces.  The seasoned fries were so salty, had to try to remove as much as possible, then ok. Over salting is clearly an issue here, pretty much across the board. We were disappointed, after reading great reviews. Would we go back?

Ordered 5 different meats and they each had their own flavor.  Unfortunately we didn\u2019t receive our fries and brussel sprouts but I\u2019m sure they are good.  The brisket, chicken (white meat) and the Mac and cheese where my favorites!  But you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.",

The char was perfect and left so many crispy bits. In fact, the crispy parts reminded me of the korean dried seaweed snack, which is delicious. Definitely get this  I ordered the $15 platter which came with 2 meats and 2 sides. The ribs were kinda small, but pretty good. The brisket was a tad dry for my taste. Not sure if I ate too slow, but the meats were a bit cold. My other side was the mac and cheese, and it was nothing special.  The seating area is small so be ready to share a table with others. They have tons of different types of sauces to try and my favorite was the Mustard one. Thanks to the other person at my table who recommended it to me.",

We turned up from the recommendations on Instagram under dcfood so it was high expectations. As you walk in you're given a menu for your take out order and they explain any specials. The staff here are just so nice so the service was great.  Then comes the food, boy oh boy... The pork belly isn't a joke... Its something to contend with whilst the mac and cheese isn't your usual mac & Cheese as its got seasoning to give it this bursting flavour. Then comes the sauces WOW they complement the food in a way that just blew my mind.  I suggest you try the platter for two which gives you 4 meats... And have pork belly & Brisket \u270c\ufe0fthank me later.",

And the sauce, again, is really a personal predilection. But regardless of how you like your rub or sauce, slow smoked bbq should always, no matter what, be tender, falling off the bone tender, wilts as soon as you take a glance at it tender. I have only had ribs THAT tender once in my life and thus I judge all other experiences to that one instance. The verdict here? The rub is off the charts flavorful, with equal balance in heat, sweet, salt, tang, and spice. You could eat it without any sauce and it would still be good. Had the chicken wings and pork spare ribs. Both were flavorful. Tenderness rating though? Not as high as I would have preferred. As for the sides, the Mac and cheese is it! Order two! The green beans are spicy so beware.",

Seating is limited, but there's outdoor and indoor seating.  I'm no bbq expert considering I'm from California, but I do know that this place was the SPOT! All of the workers here were really kind and made some really great recommendations. I got the Carolina On My Mind sandwich which had pulled pork, coleslaw, and pork rinds (I think). This was recommended to me by one of the workers. He said that the pulled pork was really good that morning and I agree! It was juicy and not overwhelmingly smoky. I tried most of their bbq sauces and the mild and hot were my favorite. I also ordered a side of coleslaw and mac and cheese. The coleslaw was okay, I could do without it. The mac and cheese was flavorful and delicious.  When I'm back in DC, I will definitely revisit this joint!",

You just might walk past it without noticing it, but here\u2019s why you should make it a point to stop in and eat here \u2013 they make great BBQ. There is an outdoor seating area, which is highly recommended for those nice weather days. But, if you want to take in the whole experience and atmosphere, eat inside (be forewarned, you will most likely smell of BBQ until you shower and wash your clothes). Step inside the metal-faced BBQ shack and you\u2019ll find seating for approximately 25 people, funny BBQ-inspired drawings on the wall, and laughter and smiles abound. During popular times, you will find it hard to get a table or a seat on the bench that runs the length of the restaurant. And if you do, you will probably be cozying up to your neighbor(s)! The bustling kitchen is situated along one side of the space and open to the restaurant. A short wall separates the line to order BBQ from the kitchen, so while you wait, you will have the opportunity to take in the sights, smells, heat, and conversation of the kitchen. There are a few small fridges that have craft brews and sodas ready for your choosing. The staff members are very friendly, helping to create a warm and welcoming vibe.  After you order, they will call your name and you can grab your tray of BBQ. You\u2019ll find lots of different BBQ sauces to try (sticky garlic, anyone?). Try a little of the BBQ without any sauces first so you can appreciate the taste. I\u2019ve tried all of their BBQ meats and have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and consistency of flavor and taste. Their sides, like the brussels sprouts and mac and cheese, are great complements to the BBQ meats, but are on the small side. The Texas toast and pickles are great, little additions full of flavor. Don\u2019t kid yourself into thinking this a healthy dining option \u2013 it\u2019s terrible for you, but such a nice treat for your taste buds. Note that there are few options for vegetarians, and they are closed Monday and Tuesday. The food is a little more expensive and the portions are a little smaller than its competitors, but the quality is a cut above. It gets loud and crowded, so it might not be the best choice for a romantic, quiet first date. Instead, bring a friend or two, and get messy while you dig into some of DC\u2019s best BBQ. After you experience dining inside the restaurant once, I would recommend sitting outside (when possible) or ordering pickup. Get there early, because they do run out of BBQ meats!",

The seating was extremely scarce because they just don\u2019t have much there. Ok, now to the food. Ordering was easy. I got the ribs, cheddar jalape\u00f1o sausage, brisket, and pork shoulder with red potato salad, green beans, Mac and cheese, and fries. Every meal comes with butter garlic toast which is great. The ribs were great. Spare ribs done right with a great seasoning on it. Cheddar jalape\u00f1o sausage was good, it has good snap but I was hoping for more of a variety of sausage. Pork shoulder was good, tender, and well seasoned. The brisket was left for something to be desired. It was pretty bland and tough. Green beans were ok, they had good flavor but were just a little too spicy to really enjoy. The potato salad could have been better if the potatoes were broken down more. They were large pieces that allowed for the potatoes to hijack the flavor. Mac and cheese and the fries were average. I\u2019m rating it 4 stars solely based on ribs and staff.  No fifth star because they did not have baked beans, that is absolute must for a bbq joint. No fifth star because the food did not warrant five stars. Recommend getting a rack of ribs and sharing or if alone, just grab a half rack and be done with it.",

I wouldn\u2019t argue that, especially not the pork belly, which is pretty good, especially the next day as leftovers.

OTOH, maybe their focus is a good thing?  And the \u201cmay be the best in the city\u201d isn\u2019t the praise it sounds like, because their competition is almost universally terrible.",

The ribs come of the bone with ease and the dry rub is really all you need to enjoy them. Though there's plenty of sauces to use. The sticky garlic was my favorite. The pork shoulder was a great combination of fat and meat for the perfect taste. The pork belly was to die for and the dish that stole the show. Let me be clear none of the meats require sauce they are all tasteful and juicy. The dinning room is communal setting of wood tables and stools. Perfect for a BBQ joint.",

The shoulder was top-tier flavorful without being smothered in sauce upon delivery, high marks. The wings were excellent as was the pork belly. The sausage was phenomenal, I was surprised to find it well balanced and not just a jumble of indistinct intensity. Went back the next night for the brisket - insanely good.

I also knew even before stepping inside it was going to be great when I spotted a sign saying that they close when the food runs out. I tried their brisket, pork belly, pork ribs, and mac and cheese. The brisket was moist, flavorful, and had the right amount of smokiness.  The pork belly was tender and melted in my mouth. The mac and cheese tasted like it was made at home and gone too quickly. The only complaint was that the pork ribs were dry and a little tough. Nonetheless, I have found a good replacement for great Bbq in the DMV and will be coming back.",

I walked in there late Friday to grab a bite and one of the employees walked over to greet me and let me know they were running low (or had run out) of most items, but that I was welcome to anything they had left. I went with the turkey sandwich and a side of fries and it was great. After sampling most of the other meats, I think the smoked turkey might be the best one I've had. Great taste, not dry, only critique is that it could use more of a smoke ring but I get that's tough on their indoor smoker. Finally, one of the other employees let me try a pork rib as they were finishing up which was 1-tasty and 2-really nice of them. Rub may have been a little too salty for my taste, but I think that's generally the case for me. Best part of this place is the customer service.",

I really liked this sandwich and I don't really consider myself a big sandwich person either.  My favorite item on their menu is not really barbecue but the brussel sprouts. I kid you not when I say these are the greatest brussel sprouts to ever grace this good planet. They are crispy, cooked perfectly and they give you a gigantic AF portion every time for a fantastic price.  I tell everyone about this place.

The 'plate for 2' was enough food for my family of three, with a little left over!  I'm a Brussels sprouts fan, and their crispy Brussels sprouts were fantastic, skip the fries and go straight for these as your side. It was very relaxed and the service was efficient.

There was a lot of confusion about if customers needed to pick the food up once it was done vs our \"server\" bring it to us. We had to shout our order to the cashier. NOT all three items they offer are on the gross dirty paper menus. They're on a board behind you as you stands facing the cashier?! The cashier gave us SOME of our drinks, took our name, & then we had a random employee walk us to our table. He never showed back up. I wondered in to find out what was going on with our order and the strangers sat at our same table... After we had been sat & waited several moments. I received our food after I went inside to ask what was taking so long or see if it got marked as a take out. The guy manning the grill asked if I heard him shout for us. I said nope, never had a restaurant shout for customers that were sat at a table. I had to ask for the rest of our drinks and make 4 trips. The random employee stood there as I juggled hot metal pans?! I had to go back inside to get sauces, napkins, silverware, etc. from the very back next to a sink/employee area. The cashier told me to go back there. After everything was said and done. I carried everything back inside because they don't have a trashcan outside. I'm assuming it's not a self serve place from all the confusion happening outside. They don't have signs stating they're self serve but you'd have to visit more than once to even know menu is half written on papper & the other half on the wall behind you. The food was delicious but the service, organization (lack of), & poor layout left a lot to be desired. Place a to go order and don't wreck your BBQ experience.",
