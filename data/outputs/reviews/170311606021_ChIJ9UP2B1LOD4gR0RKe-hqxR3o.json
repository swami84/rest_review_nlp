We were greeted warmly with friendly smiles as if we coming to your auntie's house to eat and she was happy to see you. It was about 2:00p and we were the only customers at the start but others entered shortly after us. The service was great and attentive.  My daughter and I split the  jibaritos lechon and bistec. She got french fries instead of rice. I was pleasantly surprised about how good the jibaritos were. The meat was super flavorful. The plantains were caramelized, crunchy on outside but tender on the inside. The fries and yucc mojo were perfectly cooked: good and crispy. The mojo had the perfect tang and garlic bite.  My mama-in-law had the Chuleta con arroz y frijoles negros. She liked the rice but likes her pork chops a little less done.  My hubby had ropa vieja con arroz con grandules which he said was \"great and flavorful.\"  The cafe cubano and cafe de leche were  delicious!! Both Strong but smooth.  My hubby had to get a third cafe cubano!  All in all, everything was great and worth the wait. We are definitely coming back for the food and to try Fabi's cafe next time cause she said she can make an even better cup of coffee.",

The lobster barely had any meat on there for that price. For just 10$ more we could have gotten a meal at red lobster..

My biggest concern was the lack of PROTOCOL TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMERS AND STAFF. Not only have I seen the servers wearing their masks on their chins, but having noses exposed. The staff inside preparing drinks and food are seen maskless until they see a customer looking. They allow people to freely walk around inside and around the patio tables without masks. The distance between the outdoor patio is about 2 feet apart from each table. I felt super unsafe being there. They do not even provide hand sanitizer to the customers. If you want Cuban food, there are plenty of other places that are better quality and are following COVID-19 protocol to keep a safe environment. I won't be back because the service, safety, and just ok food. The environment was very reckless and careless for the safety of their customers.",

Jibarito sandwich is insanely yummy. Rice is on point. They carry Malta (old favorite) and atmosphere is chill. I love this place. Someone please carry me out, I don't want to leave....",

My sandwich was a little burnt, the ingredients weren't fresh, and I felt like I could have made it at home. My coworker said her sandwich was okay but she wouldn't get it again. The entrees looked good though. The atmosphere was hectic and one of staff's child was screaming for the majority of my wait. Would not return.",
