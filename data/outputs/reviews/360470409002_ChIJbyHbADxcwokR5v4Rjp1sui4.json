Added to that they didn't even send dumpling sauce.  When I called the restaurant to tell them, the woman on the phone sounded upset and apologized and said she would send another order with a free soda.  When the delivery guy showed up with the food, I attempted to show him the hair in the food and he just waved me off like he didn't care! I fussed at him and told him that what he was doing was extremely rude, unprofessional and disrespectful and that they needed to learn how to wear hair nets when they're cooking people's food.  I don't think I'll be ordering from there anymore. Not only was there hair in the food but the guy that brought me the replacement didn't care and had a smirk on his face.  I normally don't have any problem with this restaurant and the food is always good, but just because I order from them frequently and ESPECIALLY because I'm a regular customer, I should not have been treated like that. Completely lowered my expectation of them and turned me off from ordering from them again",
