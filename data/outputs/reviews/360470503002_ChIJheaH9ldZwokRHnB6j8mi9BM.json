Price wasn't so bad: $60 incl. tip for 3 people (I normally give 20% tip, however, I only gave 10% tip this time for bad service).  1. Soup was bad:  Tom Kha soup had no lime-salt interplay.  It was bland, sweet(?) and uninspired.  I had one very lonely shrimp with an entire bowl of soup to itself.  They should've made sure he at least had a playmate.  I'm sorry, but to qualify as \"shrimp tom kha, you really need to have more than one shrimp.  I've had better tom kha from a can.  2. Appetizers were actually pretty good:  Spare ribs were amazing.  If I ever come back , it would be just for them.  Fried calamari was surprisingly good.  Who ever heard of fried calamari at a Thai place?  But then again, it's not hard to make food taste good by frying.  Fried poop would probably not be half bad.  3. Entrees were uninspired and bland.  The curry was ... feh.  Again, totally uninspired.  Bland.  The beef's texture and flavor was that of boiled beef - a bit rubbery and tasteless.  Steamed fish (striped bass) was ok.  I've had much better.  They could've done interesting things with it.  As it was, all I can say is ... \"meh!\"  4. Service was abysmal.  Inattentive, but when they were attentive, they \"hovered\".  I hate hovering waiters.  They should simply walk past tables and glance in the patron's direction to try to make eye contact.  If no eye contact is established, leave the customer alone.  We will definitely try to initiate eye contact when we want something.  What's so hard about this?  We felt like they were rushing us out towards the end of the meal.",
