I go here AT LEAST once a week and have had many things from the menu. All around great local place to support.  The curries are deliciously paired with a side of sticky rice. The broth in their Phos will cure any stomach ache or craving for a warm soup. I personally love the Thai iced tea with my meals and end my dinner with the mango sticky rice dessert. You won\u2019t leave anything left in the bowl! I recommend any of their noodle dishes as well. I actually recommend everything \ud83d\ude00.

And she has finally found the place that rivals or beats the great flavors of our favorite Thai restaurant in southwestern IL where we used to live. And that place is Sticky Rice in Champaign.  Thai restaurants tend to be awfully similar in many cases, except for sauce flavors. The real headline here is that the flavor at Sticky Rice is incredibly flavorful and well, awesome.  I had the Pad Wood Sen (#32 priced at $10). A very flavorful generous portion of thin bean noodles stir-fried with eggs, carrots, celery, bean sprouts, onions, and garlic in a brown sauce.  In my wife's words, \"A lot of places can't seem to get that brown sauce right.\" Sticky Rice sure does, and great ingredients. We'll be back and we hope the place remains in business for a long time.",

I ordered the crab rangoon which was in huge generous sized triangles. They were so cute and delicious. They were served with 2 different sauces. One is a light citrus based sauce that instantly gave me orange dreamsicle vibes but very savory. The second sauce was a Thai sweet chili sauce that was not spicy at all for those who don\u2019t like spice (I love spicy) for my entree I ordered the pho special. I am a self proclaimed pho connoisseur. The pho was spectacular very clean tasting and very flavorful before adding anything. I was overjoyed that it was not packed with the over powering taste of MSG like some other restaurants. The beef was sliced very thin and very juicy still. I reveled in every bite and slurp. At the end of my wonderful meal I had the pleasure to talk to the owner who was extremely professional, polite and also knowledgeable in her position and her cuisine. I will be back during lunch which is 11-2 Monday-Friday because I love a good lunch deal! 12/10 would recommend for any Asian food lover like me!!",
