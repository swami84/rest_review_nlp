We were offered a table right by the door which we declined. We asked about a back table but we were told it was reserved for a smaller party (four in our party). We asked about a table up front by the window and that was reserved for a party of eight (which I did notice arrived a short time after us). We ended up at a table outside (gorgeous evening so outside was fine). The table and chairs were on a definite slope. We took it without complaint at this point. Of the four meals, three were excellent and one was OK. The service was mediocre.",

We ordered a Red Sangria, Strawberry Mojito, and Paloma but the bartender messed up the order and gave us two Strawberry Mojitos and a Paloma. We didn't accept the wrong drink and demanded the fix. The Red Sangria consisted of red wine, rum, and, prosecco. It said it came with fresh fruit but it didn't. It didn't even come stirred or with a stirrer. The Strawberry Mojito consisted of white rum, mint, muddled strawberries, lime juice, and prosecco shaken and served over the rocks. It was sweet and fruity. The Paloma consisted of tequila, grapefruit juice, lime, simple syrup, and soda.  We told the hostess that we had a reservation and wanted a table in the patio. It was nice that we didn't have to close our tabs but rather transfer them. The hostess brought us to a table in the patio. We waited about 15 minutes in the patio for a server to take our order but no one ever came so I went up to the hostess stand to tell them we were ready to order.  We were glad we ordered appetizers including a cheese platter and Mac and Cheese because despite the almost empty dining room, it took about 45 minutes for our entrees to come out. Our cheese platter consisted of Greenhill, Mahon, and Idiazabal. Greenhill reminded me of a brie cheese due to its sweetness, creaminess, and smooth texture. Mahon reminded me of a muenster cheese due to its richness,  creaminess, and nuttiness. Idiazabal was smoky and nutty. All of these cheeses were served with honey and assorted toasted pita chips, some plain and some with sesame seeds. The Mac and Cheese consisted of fusilli pasta, three cheese bechamel, herbed bread crumbs, and shaved Grana Padano cheese. It was served in a cast iron skill. The flavors were much lighter than expected.  For dinner, the guys ordered Creekstone 8oz Burgers with Cheese and Bacon but with varying temperatures - rare and medium rare and varying condiments. The Creekstone Burger consisted of 8oz beef patty, lettuce tomato, pickles, cheese, and crispy bacon in between brioche buns. It was served with fries and ketchup.  We didn't think anyone could mess up a burger. My friend's burger was medium rare instead of rare, had white cheddar cheese, and had no pickles instead of pickles while my boyfriend's burger was rare instead of medium rare, had american cheese, and with pickles instead of no pickles. We were extremely hungry and didn't want to wait any longer for a remake of the burgers. I ordered a half portion of the Grilled Salmon, which was served over butter beans and kale ragout, leeks, fennel, and a crispy artichoke in a sambucca and dill broth. Since I asked for no black pepper, the dish was a little too salty.",

Thank you District Kitchen for the response. I only post honest reviews based on my experience. I've visited this restaurant during the month of March for the past 5 years because it's right across the street from the hotel of my annual conference. And twice (2 years) out of that time I was either not seated or told to make a reservation. I could have mentioned that my family of four including myself (and a 6yr old at the time) was turned away in the cold without a reservation despite having empty tables available during one of those visits but I decided to keep the review about the food. FROWNED UPON is exactly the correct verbiage for what I experienced. Other words are also applicable but that isn't necessary.",

I first got the beet salad which was not as good as expected the beets were off balanced / salty - weird but I\u2019d give it 3/5. I also got a half plate of grilled salmon which was excellent and a solid 5/5. Overall I enjoyed this restaurant, would recommend it and will likely return",

Great atmosphere, comfortable and welcoming service, and the food was beautifully executed. Cabernet, cheese plates, fries, mussels (oh my!), steaks, shrimp, pasta etc. The second night our server (who didn't even wait on us the previous night) had our preferred cabernet ready, remembering what we like. Hard to find customer service like that, keep it up!",

There were long periods of time between means where we were waiting on our server.  I started to look around and noticed she was virtually the only one in the room with a sense of urgency. Expect she was essentially the only inside server and was even behind the bar mixing the drinks!  This place would do well to hire more staff.  The starters were delicious. The main course - we both had halibut - was nothing special. It was slightly over cooked and had little flavor. The vegetables were fresh and tasty however.  The desserts felt like they were prepared days ago and kept cold - cremeburle and key lime pie.  Not a great exeperience.",

Usually less busy than other nearby restaurants, which makes it a low maintenance choice at popular times - don't wait 45 minutes for a table at brunch, go to District Kitchen!",

My husband and I ordered a soft cow's milk cheese and blue cheese. The cheese was freezing cold, straight out of the fridge. I've never heard of anyone serving cheese cold like that. Every restaurant I've ordered cheese from has it clearly sitting out to be at delicious room temperature-- bringing out all the flavors of the cheese. And the cow's cheese was not a fresh cut-- it was hard on the side. The bartender gave me a dirty plate and she didn't check on us or ask how the food was for a solid 15 mins (the bar was NOT busy). This all should have been a sign but we kept going.  We ordered gnocchi and the sweet and spicy cauliflower. The gnocchi was not light and pillow-y and the \"brown butter\" sauce did not have the nutty, lovely taste of brown butter. It was quite gross but I was really hungry and ate most of it. The cauliflower on the other hand, we each had one bite and then didn't touch it. \"Sweet and spicy\" apparently meant limp cauliflower doused in soy sauce and hot sauce and covered in green onions.  The bartender only charged us for our drinks and gnocchi after we explained the situation, which I appreciated, but she never apologized. No manager or anyone from the kitchen came to check on the situation. One big disappointment. Not returning and trying to see if OpenTable will switch my giftcard to a different restaurant.",

Steak was cooked exactly the way I wanted it. I ordered medium well and there was just a hint of pink in the center. The wife had the paella and said it was almost as good as her grandmothers.

We were seated quickly, but the time between the order taking and the food delivery was long. Service was good otherwise as was the food, but the prices were the highest you're likely to see. An Irish Coffee, 2 cheese burgers with fries and a beer cost $68 dollars after all was said and done. Even the bacon bits added $2 to her burger after the $2 for the slice of cheese. Tax was 10 percent and gratuity was 18 percent for a party of 6. The menu up front that got us to enter had happy hour prices that we'd never see. Less the drinks, McDonalds was 2 doors down and offered the same basic fare we had at a fifth what we paid. None of us could figure out light fare came to $184 for six people.  We spent 20 minutes debating the bill and reprocessing in disbelief. What is $68 for 2 burgers and a couple drinks in DC anyway?  As I said to my girl; it would have been a spending spree for her at the shoe store. Nice place, but if you come, plan to spend big. We later found out that due to an error, we were undercharged by a dollar.",

Mussels were perfectly cooked and served in a tasty tomato sauce. Tuna tartare was wonderful - like sushi on toast - great sesame flavor without overwhelming the tuna.  Drinks were decent: good cocktails, pretty good beer & wine selection. They do serve a good number of local brews, so big bonus points for that.  Will try to get back after the next zoo visit!",

They also offer half plates of pasta which is nice to allow sampling of various items. The indoor space is warm and inviting. They also have a nice outdoor space on Connecticut for people watching. The service was friendly though a bit slow. The beer selection was limited with just a few drafts but they do have a few good beers. They were kid friendly with high chairs. We'll be back.",
