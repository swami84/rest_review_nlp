I also got the shrimp summer rolls because I thought that I would like them more\u2026 The beef was better. The shrimp was good too, but the beef was really good. And I don\u2019t even usually like summer rolls when they\u2019re not fried. So that just goes to show you. Anyway, these reviews are real so whatever people recommend I would say go for it.

They work quickly but the food still comes out so hot and fresh. They give you SO MUCH meat and food. So much fresh veggies and delicious broth.  I ordered the pho # 3 with the Flank and Rare beef. CHUNKS of fresh, moist meat. Not dry whatsoever! I found this place based on a frequents recommendation who works close by, I live across town. Unless you work close by and walk here, street parking can be a little tricky. Just be patient and search the surrounding streets for meter parking. ITS WORTH it!

That aside, their soup broths are still among the most flavorful and interesting in town, second only to Saigon Remembered (now in Cockeysville). Summer rolls are delicious and giant, like 6\" each. Split the beef and lemongrass summer roll order with a friend and that would have been plenty for lunch for both of us. I'd go there if I happened to be in the neighborhood again.",
