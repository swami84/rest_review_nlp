They took my money, and then when I come today, they said you ordered the turkey and is like 63 dollars. I was like what? After I argue with the staff. I said never mind just give me half of it. That is all I need. The staff is rude af, and they charge me for 33 dollars. More importantly, the turkey is not even hot. It felt like the turkey is come out of the refrigerator or something.
