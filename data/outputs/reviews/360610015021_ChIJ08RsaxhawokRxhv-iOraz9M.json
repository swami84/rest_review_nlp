I got the beef pho with spicy broth and it was definitely delicious, and perhaps more importantly you get a ton of food for the price you pay (which is good because it's a little above average on the price scale at ~$14 a bowl). The one thing to note, if you don't order online ahead of time, they only take cash, but ordering online you can still use card. Wait isn't too long for any order, but it will definitely still be a little slower than your typical take out depending on what you get. I can't wait to try out more of the options they have, as everything looks and smells delicious when you walk in there.",

And they usually are cash only, like Vietspot. That being said, it\u2019s not the cheapest as far as lunch goes. $14 and change for a Pho bowl with grilled pork chops. Of course, with all the fixins - jalape\u00f1os, lime, sprouts, sauces. I got it with ramen and I\u2019m pretty the noodles are from those ramen packets you used to eat in college. Love it. The portions are LARGE and did I say how great the food is? Talk about feel good eats. This stuff will put you on a good food high, again in a good way. Ingredients are simple and fresh. Make sure you also get an iced Vietnamese coffee. It\u2019s an extra $5 but well worth it.",

The store is small, but the service is very warm! There are a few guests at noon during the week and it is recommended to avoid the meal.

Serving size was decently large but taste was average. Pork was quite raw, but cooked more when I let it bathe in the soup for a while. Broth was quite bland, however. Very little richness and tasted almost like water. They gave me a metal spoon instead of a porcelain for soup, which I found odd. Service was decent, but didn\u2019t make up for the other lacking qualities. They ran out of banh mi at 7 pm on a Tuesday. And water was self-serve and also almost empty. Pho choices weren\u2019t that many, and didn\u2019t have Bun Bo Hue. Wouldn\u2019t recommend overall.  Edit: Sorry, the beef was super raw, not the pork.",

It is a fast food \"Self-Service\" restaurant. After I seated myself, I went to the counter to order since I did not see anyone attending. I was asked to pay first when ordering and when I inserted my credit card, the options for tips were 15%, 20% or others. As I had to serve myself including pouring the water, I paid a $2 tip. When my number was called, I picked up the order myself. The food was just average as I had tried better Pho at some places including my recent visit to Las Vegas. I would not have written this review if it ended just like that. What prompted me to write was that when I was preparing to leave with my son, the girl at the counter said \"Can you help me bring the tray and bowl?\" I took my tray and bowl to her anyway; good thing she did not ask me to clean up the table because I would definitely have asked  \"why do you set up your machine for a 15% or 20% and have a tip bowl at the counter if you don't provide any service at all? Give me my tip back!\" If you behave like a fast food restaurant like Burger King, do NOT ask customers nor expect any tip then!",

Today, I had some time and ate in and had the grilled chicken pho and I guess it was chicken stock.  I'm used to having beef stock so expect it to be more flavorful, so that could have been it.  Most Vietnamese places I go to have the grilled chicken or pork whole, but they cut it into strips for you here for convenience that is definitely a plus IMO.  Will try the beef pho the next time I'm in this area on a weekday, but for now recommend the sandwiches over the pho.  The pho came with the usual accoutrements,  basil, bean sprouts, lime.",
