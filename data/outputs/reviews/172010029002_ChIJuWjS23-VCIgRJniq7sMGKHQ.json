Her daughter was in the background yelling and asking questions. When they finally arrived at my home my drinks had spilled all over the food and everything was soaked. My husband then said something about it and her daughter starts screaming out the passenger side of the car cussing us out. He handed her the food back and took back the money. I then called the restaurant to inform them on their employees behavior and as soon as I gave my address was hung up on. UNBELIEVABLE SERVICE AND TREATMENT! Wouldn't waste my time.",

We asked for our fried rice combo and our shrimp lo mein to be extra spicy and there wasn't a single flake of spice in either. They also only sent us one cup of hot sauce to be shared between 6 people. The rice looked and tasted like it came out of a box. The lo mein noodles were pasty and stuck together like they used yesterdays leftovers. We ordered extra shrimp, which were smaller than a nickel, and there was barely any shrimp. I could only imagine had we not ordered extra shrimp. I don\u2019t know what the chicken was made out of but it was not chicken. It had a completely different taste and texture, absolutely disgusting. If you want good Happy Wok go to the one on 11th St or the one on E. State. DO NOT go to this place unless you want to be disgusted and grossed out when you get your food.",

I went inside and the place smelled rancid (this should have been my first clue and it's really on me for not turning around and walking out).  When I got my food, the fried rice and sweet and sour pork had clearly been cooked in very, very old grease.  And I'm guessing the foul odor might have come from having a grease trap that wasn't cleaned in quite a while.  Anyhow, I am the furthest thing from a picky eater there is and the taste of the food is a secondary concern here to how incredibly unsanitary it is to cook using re-used grease.  I'm not trying to be glib here but I would steer clear of this place for the sake of your health.",

We got all the way home I realized all the containers were their SMALLEST SIZES yet she charged me for FAMILY SIZES, I was going to just look over it but I ate ONE egg roll and tasted the rice. The rice wasn't done and had no taste to it whatsoever, the \"beef egg roll\" had god knows what in it but it DEF wasn't beef! Called the lady back and she basically argued with me for 10 minutes then finally said I could bring the food back in. Brought it back, and she looked in each box seen there was one eggroll missing and instead of giving my whole 21.83 back for her being rude and getting my order wrong she gave me 18.00 and said she HAD to charge me for eating the egg roll!?!?!? ummmm. the egg rolls are ONE DOLLAR AND NINETEEN CENTS NOT THREE DOLLARS!!!!  NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT LOCATION AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
