But then something happened and the sandwiches went away and the world was sad.  But I randomly checked Google/Yelp for sandwiches nearby and saw that there were NEW reviews from here talking about their sandwiches.  So I walked down and got myself an Italian.  Now let's be clear, the sandwich is over $13 with tax.  But, it's a really good sandwich and depending on your gluttony, you can easily save half for dinner or lunch tomorrow.  That's what I did.  The Italian was stuffed with meat and cheese and sweets (or hots, or both) and it was glorious.  The bread was wonderful.  I have this debate with my girlfriend about hard rolls vs soft rolls.  I'm a soft roll person because I like the perfect bite and she apparently prefers dental bills.  But this sandwich from Prego had warm crispy bread that was also easy to squeeze into my piehole and it was amazing.  Definitely go here for a sandwich.  All day.  Any day.",

Their cubano sandwich is solid.  Previous review: Good selection of wines, though the interior temperature of the store on hotter days makes me wonder if they\u2019re generally kept at a temperature that maintains quality. Deli is small but offers huge portions. Ordered the Italian sandwich they offer and was shocked by the size, but overall found it way too salty - suspect their dressing blend goes a bit overboard on the salt. Will return to buy wine or beer, but unsure about if I\u2019ll give the deli another shot.",
