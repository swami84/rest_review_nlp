He greeted me every time I walked in the store and offered me to try out different things. I'm not 100% sure but I think Frank cares and puts in effort to give you the best food and service possible. The staff at the store sometimes are not so friendly but they are knowledgeable and hard-working. Overall, although I do not have an Italian background, I think this is a nice place.

Their customer service is the best. The employees will go out of their way to make sure your experience and products are the best. They\u2019ve always offered me free samples of various cured meats and cheeses while I\u2019m there, definitely widening my palate for the foods they offer.  The difference that is made when purchasing fresh products from a butcher shop and a super market is pretty crazy. If I compare two of the same dishes, one made with Sorriso products and the other with supermarket products, hands down Sorriso will always win.  Definitely give this place a try. Very much worth it for the price and quality.",

Now with that being said I'll go ahead and outline my experience here...  Food and delivery was great and on time. HOWEVER I was well aware of the $4 delivery fee the business required and tipped $2 to the driver for a $40 order. I find it to be utterly ridiculous that workers who deliver expect to be paid 15-18%. I shouldn't have to pay a cost of a meal for tip as he was requesting for.  Upon delivery and receipt of my order in hand, Mohamed prompted me \"Miss, I drove here 15 minutes in a car and not a bicycle--$2? Really?\". Hence blatant request for money. Now with that being said----  TIP IS OPTIONAL AND ITS YOUR JOB TO DRIVE  FOR A DELIVERY SERVICE. I shouldn't be tipping the driver $10 (price of a meal ONCE AGAIN) when he isn't a bartender or server which I am more than happy to reward actual experience of a particular service that I intentionally go-out of my way to ask for.  Really disappointed because the quality of food they have here is awesome. But obviously as it goes for any successful business model-the ratio weighs heavier upon service than the actual product. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT BRINGS CUSTOMERS BACK.  Needless to say I do not suggest delivery unless your willing to pay some $$$ or expect harassment.",

I don't know where they source their beef, but I ran into the butcher from Frankel's there and he gave me the approving fist bump when he saw me buying those puppies.  Everyone who works there is knowledgable as hell. They'll tell you what's good that way, always give discounts to regulars, help you with your bags to the car. This is grade A, quality, specialty, gourmet food lovingly served by traditionalists and enthusiasts. This is the kind of store Mario Batali dreams of.  And a nice bakery across the street.",
