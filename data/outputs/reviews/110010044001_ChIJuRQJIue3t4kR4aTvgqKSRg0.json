Also this was the prefix menu for us so we were given lots of food to try. First we started off with a small mint tea. I don't like mint tea, but to each their own. Next we got two drinks. I don't enjoy alcohol, but my gf and friend seemed to enjoy it. Then we got to the first prefix part. Where we were given a food tower with different vegetables such as olives, radish, pickles, cabbage slaw. Also got a beet spread and humus. All of this was eaten with the given naan bread. I enjoyed most of this food. Nit the biggest fan of olives or beets so I didn't love the beet spread, but the pickled beets tasted good. The hummus was good and the rest of the platter was good. The came the meat part of the meal. We got duck and lamb. I didn't really enjoy the lamb, but the duck tasted really good. We were given more naan and sauces to eat with the meat. Two of the sauces were really good. The garlic one and the tahni. The lamb had a weird taste and felt slimy, maybe I just not a fan of lamb. The duck looked interesting but tasted really good. Was like a chewier steak. Lastly we had this chocolate dessert. And this was interesting. It was like a mulchy chocolate cheese with a sweet honey syrup thing to put on top. Poured the whole saffron honey on top loved the sweetness. The dessert was good, but not like an american dessert. This brings me to the whole experience. Was this the best food I have ever eaten? No, but that could be due to the fact I am not use to this food. I have different taste that I have grown fond of. But was it nice trying another cultures food and experiencing this restaurant. Yes. Would I come again? Probably not. It was quite expensive for me and now that I have experienced the food and haven't found it to be the most amazing food to my taste. I would like to try food at other places. The restaurant looked less open also because of covid. Lastly kinda hard to find. Its down an alley for those wondering.",

Their menu is diverse with several small plates using lamb, beef, duck, and fish. Their dipping sauces are difference makers, providing truly savory and spicy flavord that enhance everything. Their serve fresh bread all night. The servers were very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu. A great experience in a very cool atmosphere. Highly recommend.",

We picked up at 5, drove 45 minutes home and reheated per the instructions, and it really tasted as if it were set down in front of us at the restaurant.  Everything was perfectly seasoned, tender, moist... just... striking. This is the best take home anything I've had. Since, ever.  It ain't cheap, but I'd definitely give up three very good orders for one phenomenal meal from Maydan. I'll start cooking more at home so I can save my next order-in to be another memorable  one.",

This may seem over the top, but read on and you'll see why this was one of the most special and delightful experiences we had in 2020.  First, let me say that it was clear an INCREDIBLE amount of thought and planning went into the the meal.  Even other Michelin-level restaurants struggle with how to convert from dine-in to take out during COVID-19.  Maydan has offered the best home dining experience we have seen, bar none, and we cannot imagine one-upping this.  Each item was packaged carefully to keep well (for example, crisp ingredients and sauces separated from other items so nothing would go soggy). Each had impeccable but simple preparation instructions.  Second, the dishes themselves were absolutely stellar.  The rack of lamb was some of the best we've ever tasted, as ardent lamb connoisseurs.  The meat was carefully marinated and vacuum-sealed to keep it fresh, with the perfect amount of sauce and pomegranate molasses required for saucing and crusting.  The cooking time was spot-on for perfect lamb.  The mezze platter and dips were a positive delight, with a plethora of different Middle-Eastern delights to top the pita.  The fennel salad (I think with raddichio and arugulua) was fresh, crisp, and satisfying.  The accompanying brussel sprouts roasted-on-the-stalk made for a striking presentation and went down very well with their sauce. The duck confit fatayer was impeccable and had a beautiful crust.  Third, the the biggest surprise was how generous the Thanksgiving portions were.  It made for a true feast, and we actually managed to get at least 4 full meals for two from the order.  For example, an order for two included an entire salted honey pie (a dish not to be missed!).  This counts doubly when you're aware of just how hard restaurants have had to watch their budgets and food costs during these lean times.   I don't know who gave the nod to these portions, but they're an absolute gem: this was a striking mark of generosity to customers, and a sign of determination to deliver value and ongoing festive delight to customers.  All and all, the Maydan Thanksgiving was a highlight for the year, and I wonder if they might consider something similar even after coronavirus perod passes?  If not, then I hope someone from the Michelin guide had a chance to sample it, because I think a single Michelin Star was selling them short.",

And for that amount of money, and for the reputation of the place, the expirience was subpar. We were greeted with tea, nice start, which also helped to warm our hands at 38 deg outside. It was then followed by opening dishes - hummus, cabbage salad, chickpeas salad and a salad of nuts and squash with funny name. These dips were accompanied by 4 pita breads, for 6 ppl (??). The salads were very good. Good as my grandma would do? Not so much. Michelin good? I'm not sure, but they were good. After the salads they served us a plate with meat, i want to say it had 8-10 medallions of lamb meat. With a litter bit of couscous, and two plates with mashed potatoes and caramelized onion. It was also good. Not Amazing but def good. After that i asked our waitress what's next? She said that that's it, next are our deserts. Needless to say were disappointed to say, the least. Maydans name is known for food feasts, what we had on the table was more like a wholefoods based quick healthy dinner. A Michelin place, for NYE, serving us salads For deserts we got Baklava. Two plates with two pieces of baklava. That's it. Tea? We had to ask for it, it wasn't even offered. Coffee? Espressos? Never even mentioned. Oh, you want to taste our famous Knaffe? We did not make it for tonight. Sorry. That was the actual conversation between us and our waitress.  To be honest, at this point it was beyond embarrassing, we came there for the food and amazing reputations of the \"Maydan's expirience\", we left there feeling like we were ripped off. Plain and simple.  We remember this place better, but based on this expirience i could not recommend it to anyone.",

The food was generic, non innovative, and basic. The only Shout out is to the waiting staff that was friendly and kind (yet a bit clumsy). I rarely write bad reviews, but this one is well deserved.

All of the lackluster food here is dressed up with pickled onions to make up for the lack of seasoning. We pretty much ordered the whole menu. I\u2019d go back for the halloumi, carrots, sumac lemonade, and sauces. Everything else we ordered (lamb hummus, baba ghanoush, labneh, Aleppo kebab, saffron kebab, ribeye, bread) was like the color beige in the mouth... the meat especially. There are many other restaurants serving this style of food for a fraction of the price. Even Cava is leagues above this place. Overall a disappointing experience.",

We missed the ambience, of course, but because our family is bigger than they could accommodate on the patio with social distancing, it was the next best option to being there in person.

I can get similarly good food from Astor Mediterranean for about $50 or even better food from Zaytinya for $100-150. If you want to throw your money away, sure, dine here and lucky you that you can do that during the Great Covidepression. Otherwise, consider going somewhere else. It's just hype and little substance. I have no intention of returning or ordering again. (Caveat: the best thing to do is just order their goat shawarma for $16 and leave.

        "caption": "UPDATED: I previously reviewed the very annoying reservation experience. Here are my thoughts after actually eating there. Not worth the hype. This is a place to try one time and then be done with it. The head hostess was unwelcoming. Our server was condescending and unhelpful (granted, we overheard other servers and they seemed much better). We were not greeted or thanked as we left the restaurant. The hostess ignored us until we were already out the door and we heard a half-hearted 'thank you.' The food is good, but you'd do much better to go as a group of 4-6 people, as some of the best dishes are \"too large for two people.\" We particularly enjoyed the saffron lamb. The different sauces were pretty good, but nothing absolutely amazing.  BOTTOM LINE: The experience isn't worth the competitive reservation process. Good food and cool atmosphere, although tables are squeezed together. Our experience would have been a lot better if our server had been better, so possibly just some bad luck here.  RESERVATION EXPERIENCE: We received a gift certificate to Maydan for Christmas and we've tried unsuccessfully many times to book a reservation. We're ready to go a little before 10am, but by the time we put in the information it says no tables available. Unfortunately, we have to get a babysitter, so eating at 9:30pm isn't an option and we don't want to risk trying for a bar seat and then not getting one. At this point, I'm still trying for the reservation, but it has been a huge inconvenience and due to the hassle, this would have to be the singularly best meal experience of my entire life in order for me to ever eat there again or recommend it to friends. :( If it weren't for the gift card, I'd have given up a long time ago. So far our experience is a far cry from the \"welcoming and warm atmosphere\" I've read about.",

Down a back alley you smell the smoke from the open fire pit before you enter through the blue door.  We felt like we were in Morocco. Excellent service, cocktails and food. Unique presentations and just the right amount of spice. Ordered all the condiments as recommended by our server and each was unique and fun to try. Grilled carrots were a highlight (absolute surprise and a must try), muhamarra, lamb hummus, and duck breast were excellent and the bread was the best.",

You meander down an alley, walk into a large, worn door into a small space where you're greeted with smiles and incense smells. If the timing is right for a walk in (reservations recommended) you enter yet another door and it feels like another world.  The sight of the open grill, the music, the knowledgeable service and the DELICIOUS small plates and cocktails really transport you - seriously such an intriguing, unique and warm experience. It feeds all of your senses.  I didn't want to leave Maydan and cannot wait to return!",

Cocktail menu is really nice, beautifully blended cocktails with delicate flavors. The condiments were very good. The tahini was my favourite, followed by the tomato jam. The hummus is one of the best I've ever tasted anywhere. I highly recommend this restaurant. One thing I didn't like was the independent reservation on an app. That needs looked at and improved. Other then that Maydan is a 10 out of ten.",

My friend got the bourbon cocktail and enjoyed it   We got to sit right  by the open fire! So cool and warm :).  For food we got beet salad, baba ganush (sp??), the sweet potato, halloumi, and saffron lamb, and literally all the dips. I really really really liked the halloumi. Such food flavor. If it went back, I'd probably not do the baba ganush, it was okay but not great like everything else! The sweet potato was also delicious. And the bread they keep at the table is so yummy and great for trying all the dips. Next time I was to try the hummus  and carrots!  Our server recommended getting almost double the amount of food but that would have been way too much. I was definitely full.",

I was with a group of three and we ordered the halumi, eggplant, swordfish, sweet potato, Aleppo lamb, tenderloin, and a bunch of dips. The swordfish was perfect, seared crispy but still buttery inside. The cocktails were great, especially the not-too-sweet pistachio tree. Dessert was fine but not as outstanding as the rest of the meal. We arrived 15 minutes after they opened and only got a table for the first seating because a reservation cancelled. Highly recommend getting there right when they open if you want to snag a seat at the bar",

I just kept dipping more pieces of bread into the hummus - Labneh: This was also flavorful and a nice creamy contrast to our dishes - Duck breast: We saw another table order this and HAD to order it. It was perfectly cooked, tender, flavorful. - Tenderloin: This was delicious and tender, but probably the sad middle child of all the dishes we ordered. I can't complain about the dish, but it was missing the sharp wow the other dishes brought - Zucchini: That zatar seasoning on top really packed a flavor punch. Zucchini was perfectly cooked, not too mushy, still very fresh and flavorful - Shrimp: Wow! I wouldn't say that this was spicy, but it packed a strong flavor. I loved it. Not over cooked at all. - Tahini: To be honest, this was kind of unremarkable. While flavorful, it tasted too similar to the hummus that I didn't use much of this dipping sauce. - Tomato Jam: This was bright and acidic - Chermoula: This reminded me of chimichurri and it was nice bright herby flavor  Pros: - What a gem! The restaurant entrance is hidden in an alley, with no recognizable sign on the door. Very mysterious. Once you check in with the hostess, you are lead to enter into the main dining room through another door. The layers of doors and clandestine entryways make it very magical - Food: I really cannot emphasize how amazing our meal was. That fresh bread! OMG soooo good. I would have been happy with the hummus and bread. My friend and I initially just went in to grab a cocktail and a snack before getting dinner elsewhere, but ended up coming back a few hours later for a late dinner, because the food was THAT good. - That fresh baked bread. OMG so good. Carb me up! - Thankful to the staff who were able to squeeze us in for a late reservation and accommodate us. - Cocktails were delightfully refreshing - Wine list was interesting with wines from regions my friend and I were not familiar with - Beautiful dining room. The dramatic central fire pit is the central point, with a long dramatic bar along one side of the room. With the fire pit in the center, you can't help but be mesmerized by the cooks working to tame the fire to make your meal. We sat upstairs for our meal and were able to get a nice view of the bar below - Price is right! It was a very reasonably priced meal considering the amount of food ordered, as well as a bottle of wine.  Cons: - Hard to get a rez! Every time a rez would open up on opentable, by the time I clicked the link in the email, that reservation was already gone - Despite the allure and magical entrance, it was a TAD confusing trying to locate the restaurant since the entrance is in an alleyway - Since it's a small space that is trying to pack as many people in, the tables are kind of tight, as is the bar  Would I come again? Yes!",

Yes, I was one of the crazy people who booked a table here a month in advance and yes, I did set my alarm so I could get on right at 10 am to make the reservation.  From the moment I walked into this place, I felt like I was out of DC and in Morocco or some other Middle Eastern place. The fire pit where they cook all the food is in full display on the bottom floor. We were seated on the second floor and started with the hummus (smoothest hummus ever!) and the bread they kept bringing out during the meal was to die for.  We also ordered the carrots, sweet potato, duck and lamb. Everything was tasty and the condiments were also really good. The tomato jam was especially delicious on the duck, which was seared perfectly.  We ordered the cheesecake for dessert which was another A+ choice.  Would definitely come back. Great dining experience.",

The restaurant left me and others out in the rain for 20 minutes waiting to get inside to book a walk-in reservation. 2.  We were given a 7:15 pm reservation and asked if they'd text us when the table was ready -- they said no just come back at 7:15.  We did not get seated until 30+ minutes later and had to wind up finding a corner of the first floor to huddle in for the 30 minutes with no area to stand or be out of the way. 3.  Several ordered items were never brought to the table, we had to chase down wait staff. 4.  All of the small plates we ordered with the Lamb shoulder were delivered 20+ minutes before the Lamb.  There was no effort made to apologize for the service issues or offer a dessert or take an item off the bill as a gesture.  No one item is a big deal in and of itself ... but Maydan prides itself as a Michelin star restaurant and the service needs to better match the outstanding food.",

And I\u2019ve never been given a slice of raw red cabbage as a substitute for freshly baked bread. Kinda weirdly off-putting. I also felt everything was over-spiced.

The atmosphere of the building is amazingly cool as well, with the incredibly chic restaurant hidden behind a door (with no sign) halfway down a seemingly random alley.

The place is down the alley from Florida Ave.: there's a small sign  but their actual door seems to be unmarked. We walked in and waited near the bar, which fortunately didn't take too long. The place was obviously pretty full and the house music was quite loud. The ambiance is pretty  inviting, with the open fire bread ovens right in the middle of the room. Beirut hummus with their bread is a treat; I liked their vegetable dishes. The Aleppo lamb kebab was very flavorful but if I was making it I would add some sauce or fillings to make it less dry. I'm looking forward to try their seafood in the future.",

We sat fairly close to the wood fire kitchen and was able to get a good show of the chefs' magic happening. We ordered the halloumi and several dips to start, all delicious, especially the eggplant one. Love the generously sized pieces of eggplant within the spread. We also ordered several dips to go with our meal - our favorites were the harissa and toum, though the tomato jam was delicious with bread. We ordered several meats to share including the rib eye, duck, and lamb kabobs. The meat colors were a gorgeous cool red center - cooked perfectly. The duck was probably the best duck any of us have ever had. Please don't take it off the menu!! The rib eye was flavorful and tender, and the kabob was full of seasonings/flavor. We ended the meal by trying all 3 dessert options available. The cheesecake and almond cakes were delicious but the apricot cream one wasn't good. Please add coffee to the menu, would be a great complement. Our server Laura was also super animated and passionate about the menu and explaining everything. Thanks for a wonderful experience all around, we'll definitely be back!",

FAVORITES: Halloumi - salty, nutty and sweet Toum - creamy, garlicky and texture of butter Bread - nice crusty outside and thick chewy center  JUST OK: Seasonal Fatoush - crisp bread, tomatoes, radish,  sumac vinaigrette *basic salad, crisp bread was soggy Beiruti Hummus - tomatoes, parsley, green peppers, scallions *very watery for hummus I really prefer a thicker texture Beet Borani: yogurt, dill, black sesame *really sweet, texture was very watery, black sesame didn't add to dish, it looked better than it tasted Shrimp: *this is the worst value at $18 u get 4.5 shrimp, I say .5 bc they gave us a really small piece of shrimp and there was no marinade or flavor whatsoever Ribeye: *there was a nice spice rub on it and the meat was cooked to a nice medium and was a large portion but it felt like a lower quality meat, obviously not as good as a ribeye from a steakhouse  CONDIMENTS: (In the order in which I liked them) Toum: garlic, oil, lemon, egg whites *creamy, garlicky and texture of butter Chermoula: lemon, garlic, parsley, saffron *this went well with the shrimp since that had no flavor Ezme: tomato, onion, peppers, pomegranate molasses *our server described this as middle eastern salsa pretty accurate Tomato Jam: sesame, cinnamon *very sweet didn't really go with anything Zhough: parsley, cilantro, cumin, Serrano *nearly choked from the spice of the Serrano  WINE LIST: Pretty extensive list with red, white, rose, skin contact and sparkling wines by the glass.  We tried the skin contact wines which remind me of a rose but with a slightly sour/bitter finish.  SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE: Our server was really attentive and provided great recommendations.  It is very loud so you really speak loud to hear each other.  It's also very dark and very hot so wear less clothing.  The tables are really small considering their dishes are a lot of small plates so we ran out of room on the table.  The only criticism I have is the bread service I wish they brought one per person at the beginning of the meal because we ran out quickly and then the condiments weren't really used once the bigger items came along and then they gave us bread when we didn't want any.  Menu online is outdated as well, probably about 4 months old, cmon update that!  I never understand when restaurants don't update that at least once a month.",

It\u2019s a run of the mill Mediterranean spot, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it\u2019s not a top 100 place is DC of a best new restaurant in DC.  We got the muhamarra, dango, halloumi, roasted peppers (special), condiments, shrimp, and tenderloin. Only the special was decent. The halloumi (which I love) was completely forgettable. The tenderloin was overly salted. The shrimp? Overcooked and chewy. The bread they serve was good but is it served to mask the deficiencies elsewhere? The cocktails were supremely weak. I could keep going on.  We waited for a month to come here (after failing to get reservations otherwise). An anniversary dinner that we will remember only for the let down that the food was.  Save your money and go to better places in DC. Rooster and owl, chiko, rasika, daikaya, red hen, salt line. All much much better than maydan. Maydan overhypes and under delivers.",

Everything we tried was unique and delicious - all the deserts were great, though the one with apricot and pistachio was even better.

        "caption": "I was in DC for vacation and was in the mood for Mediterranean. Maydan was highly recommended online, so we hopped a bus over. This was a Thursday night at around 7pm. This is a prime time for happy hours in DC, so I expected to wait. They told us about a two hour wait for a table, but we can wait for two spots to open at the bar if we stand near it. We opted for this option.  My only negative, that kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth, is that when they open the door for you to walk in and wait, there is next to nowhere to stand really. We stood next to the open stove, which was insanely hot, so my mom and I stood to the right side of the door for awhile to stay out of the walkway. There is no space to stand or else you're in the walkway, in front of the open stove getting cooked, or standing too close to the tables behind you. We felt like unwanted stepchildren. Therefore, it is up to you to keep your mental note about your place in \"line\" for grabbing a barseat.  When a couple of ladies got up to leave, this man and his date slid in the chair as we were going for them. I notified him that we were next, and he spoke loudly and rudely saying \"I ASSURE you that we were here first\".   I walked back out to the waitstaff and asked if we were there before them, and they did confirm that we were there first. They kindly apologized on their behalf...but don't expect them to assert authority within their own establishment...However, we were notified a little later that there was a table that freed up (since a group cancelled their reservations), so we scored a nice private table about 30 minutes later.  The food was delicious. I loved everything except the carrots. The carrots could have stood to have more flavor for the price. They weren't very cooked either. I do recommend the restaurant for it's food, environment, and waitstaff, but I wouldn't recommend it if you have abandonment issues and no reservation lol. They could stand to re-utilize the space in a manner that is more functional for those waiting for seats/tables.",

He mentioned it was one of the restaurants that he wanted to try before me moved and tried many times to get a reservation, but failed.  Well I suggested, why don't we just go and wait for a walk-in?  We did that and to our luck, we were able to snatch a table for two at the bar right when the restaurant opened!  Yay!  Very cool interior, a bit small and tight, but perfect for a date night!  The bar can be a little hot because there is a large fire in the middle of the dining room.  That's where the check cooks on the open fire and grill.  Food was either a hit or a miss!  I really loved the warm pita bread that is constantly refilled throughout your meal!  Definitely get the spreads and try many of them, I thought those were the best!  I will highly recommend getting the Toum!  It was so garlicky and delicious with the warm pita! Basically ate that ALL night! haha.  Another recommendation is the carrots with harissa!  Yum!  I also ordered the duck, which was just cooked too raw and hard to chew.  I'd suggest a pass on that.  Drinks here were so good! Something I'd do is come get drinks and eat spreads with pita.  That will be a perfect meal for me! haha.",

Spices and flavors were absolutely delicious, and the waitress was helpful in telling us what would pair well with what. The atmosphere of the building is amazingly cool as well, with the incredibly chic restaurant hidden behind a door (with no sign) halfway down a seemingly random alley. A huge fire pit in the center of the first floor is just one feature of the eclectic and cool atmosphere. You've got to go see it (and, of course, taste it) for yourself.",

It's a total experience as if you have entered another country! If you are in need of a vacation add this to the list but pack your patience if you don't have a reservation. Tucked away in a alley off FL ave once you see the detailed door you have made it. My friend and I didn't have a reservation but decided to take a chance around 6pm. I suggest you arrive early in hopes of catching a seat at the bar. We stood around for about 45 mins the music and open kitchen really help with the wait. The bartenders are very nice and full of suggestions. Once seated at the bar we stared with cocktails and dips. I add Harissa to everything because I love a kick! They make sure to keep the bread flowing as you can't get enough!!  My favorite dish was the Lamb and shrimp!! I can wait to make my next visit because this is absolutely amazing!! Me and My friend really really lovee this foo and the place was si nice for me and my friend.",

To begin with, the restaurant has a unique and charming layout; a massive hearth glows in the center, where diners can watch their food being cooked over open flame. The service was very good. I ate with a large group and we samoled the whole menu. For me, the highlights were the various dips and spreads. Each one was incredibly flavorful. The roasted veggies were also incredible. The meat was actually the weakest part of the meal for me, although it was still quite good. The meat has minimal seasonings on it, and you are meant to use the various dips and sauces to flavor it yourself, which was certainly very good, but I could have used a bit more flavor on the meat itself. The lamb shoulder was a highlight. Definitely recommend!",

With the open pit fire right next to the bar its a very interesting spot to sit for drinks. But it can get really hot at the end of the bar but our table was ready quick so we managed to get away from the open flame right on time. We got a bunch of dishes including all the dips. Those dips are the stars and the bread will fill you up even as up try each dip once. So one has to pace yourself for the rest of the food. Every dish was awesome except for the barramundi which turned out to be too salty. The service was perfect... With it being not too intrusive but right there when you needed someone's attention. Definitely a place that's perfect for date night.",

Maybe it was the night we came, but there was something missing in flavor. This region is packed with fantastic spices, pops of flavor in every bite, but I didnt get that satisfaction for what seems to be the pinnacle represenation of Middle East cuisine in Washington D.c. I've tasted better at hole in the wall spots for their straight to the point regional dishes. I feel this menu is somehow catering too much to the americanized palate. Bread is a huge component of this regions cooking and the complimentary bread (which we really appreciated) that was served was just bland and lacking. The service was excellent, very knowledgeable and didnt leave us asking questions on what to expect. Perfect service. The hostess did everything in her power to accommodate our seating preferences and was very professional. Giving four stars because I believe the overall service and ambiance was great, but will aim to try better food on our next visit!",

If you're into a very traditional American dining experience, this place might not be for you. If you're intrigued by spices, dips, condiments and jolts of flavor, you're bound to have an incredible experimental foodie experience. My partner and I ordered the carrots, beiruti hummus, the ribeye and a handful of the condiments (don't miss the toum) and another thing I can't recall. The ribeye was beautifully done and the bread with the hummus/dips was an experience in itself. Will definitely experiment with other things next time. My ONLY critique: chill out on the water! It was really hard to have a consecutive conversation because my water glass was constantly being refilled.",

Fun cultural immersion with dishes influenced by different regions in the Middle East -  Lebanon, Georgia, Iran, Morocco, etc. We enjoyed endless rounds of fluffy bread, savory dips peppered with spices, and veggies bursting with flavor.  I love how the servers come around with warm scrumptious bread right out of the Georgian clay oven! The wood-fired oven truly makes a difference and gives the bread a nice charred crust. The bread is much better than the pita at Zaytinya and more savory than naan. It's made of  white and wheat dough, salt, and honey. Apparently, it's the only wood-fired Georgian oven in the U.S.  I recommend getting a variety of dips, condiments, veggies, and dishes to share. They pair really well together with complementary flavors and go hand-in-hand with the bread!  My favorite dishes were the Halloumi Cheese, Turnips, Beiruti Hummus, Chermoula and Tahina dips, and Apple Cheesecake.  The seared Halloumi Cheese was delicious topped with peanuts, sesame, and honey. I love the texture of the cheese and how it doesn't melt.  The Turnips coated with Tahina sauce was the star among the veggies. I knew never turnips could be so tasty! The sweet potato was fun to try, but a bit too sweet from the brown sugar. Although I enjoyed the carrots, the spicy Harissa sauce was a bit tangy for me.  Of the 3 spreads we ordered, the Beiruti Hummus was my favorite. Although I was tempted to get the classic Hummus, I'm glad I ventured out and got the Beiruti. The extra veggies - tomato, scallions, parsley, and green peppers elevated the hummus. I wasn't a fan of the Zaalouk charred eggplant or the overly sweet Muhumarra with pomegranate molasses and red pepper.  I recommend trying some of the Condiments (they are worth the $1!) Of the 3 dips, I enjoyed the Chermoula with lemon, saffron, garlic, parsley and also the Tahina with sesame, lemon, and olive oil. The sauces paired well together and great for dipping the bread! I wasn't a big fan of the Toum - a heap of garlic.  Let's not forget dessert! The Granny Smith Apple Compote Cheesecake was divine! Refreshing to see a modern twist on the traditional slice of cheesecake. I love the creamy whipped pudding texture with apple compote and graham cracker crust. We savored every last bite with no crumbs spared.  If your are looking for a light refreshing cocktail - get the Marrakesh Mule! It tastes like a Moscow Mule with a Middle Eastern twist - the cardamom adds a nice kick. I wasn't a fan of the MEA (Middle Eastern Airlines) cocktail, Arak liquor has a bold black liquorice flavor. The server was really nice and swapped it out for the Marrakesh Mule.  The only thing that was bizarre and caught my attention was why the check was in an Arabic or Urdu Sacred Text book. I was told there was no religious affiliation with the restaurant. Given the respect of cultures and passion for food, why is the check presented in a sacred text? I don't get it.  As someone whose not a big fan of Michelin star restaurants, Maydan is well worth the hype and tenacious search for a reservation 3 weeks in advance! If you have a late reservation at 9:15, order your food quickly as the kitchen shuts down at 10.  While the food is pricey at $10 for a small tapas dish, the ambiance and  communal dining experience is worth it! Maydan takes the open kitchen concept to another level and delivers on its promise for a cultural immersion. If you are ready to venture, push open the cast iron door!",

The food was amazing and we got to watch the chefs working the fire pit, which was incredible.  We had probably every small dish they offer (large family celebration) and every one was incredible.  The home-made flat bread was also truly remarkable.  The lamb was basically a work of art and melted in our mouths, but the price for 4 was pretty steep considering there isn't really anything accompanying it.  Our only other complaint was the noise...we were there for a family event but in order to hear each other we had to basically scream and left a bit hoarse.  We will definitely be back though, especially if we win the lotto, as I could eat that lamb on a weekly basis.",

The cuisine is Georgian and North African, the restaurant has a striking design with a massive open fire grill/pit right in the middle of the restaurant.  There is something about coming in from the cold in the winter that is particularly inviting.  The food is excellent, well executed, beautifully presented and intriguing to the palate.  It's not easy to find competition in this category - in any case it's just great food.  The service is excellent and the staff is accommodating.  They're definitely hitting on all cylinders at the moment.  As a result the place is super busy - so be prepared, drink some excellent Georgian wine while you wait, and enjoy.",

        "caption": "I am always both pleased and surprised when a restaurant surpasses the hype and delivers a unique experience that will definitely be something I repeat. We visited Maydan on a sunday night, with reservations for a party of four.  (I do suggest making a reservation, although you can get lucky if there is a cancellation - or if there is space at the bar).  The reservation system can be tricky, as this is not a large venue and it is popular. We lingered at the bar before being seated, as this restaurant has really nice decor (I took a lot of pictures) and an open, wood fired grill/oven) that is a centerpiece of the downstairs seating area. We were seated fairly quickly, and the drink and food selections were unique and delicious.  I strongly urge you to ask the server about the menu, as this is not a typical middle eastern restaurant. We tried all the sauces (under $10 for all of them) and enjoyed them with the ample house-made Pita breads.  only 2 were spicy, and all were tasty. The food came out as it was cooked, and I must endorse the carrots, the beets, the baked cheese, the Chicken (a must have, it comes with sauce, although it is marvelous plain).  The Lamb was a  smaller,  tasting portion, and equally well prepared and delightful.  We did not have the salads, but I can only imagine that they are equally as good. The owner did greet us, and explain that Maydan was a traditional \"gathering  or eating space, where people meet\".   She was passionate about her restaurant and  wanted to make sure our experience was satisfactory.  I was impressed with her excitement about what she does, and her challenges in meeting everyone's expectations.  IMHO, she does a great job and has a well trained and equally passionate staff. Our experience was wonderful and this is truly a restaurant experience worth repeating. Parking is tough around the restaurant, so I recommend an Uber or mass transit.  The restaurant is in an alley, look for the sign on the corner of the building so you don't wander around.  Handicapped access is doable but may be difficult, and the alley is set back from the street. When you come to Maydan,  leave any preconceived ideas at the door.  This is a non-typical but not over-reaching venue.  Try the wine, or their house special mixed drinks, and live in the moment.  Enjoy!",

I was impressed by the food quality, but the price for the quantity was hard to swallow.  The discomfort level of the actual space was oddly at contrast with a fine dining experience, unless hipster-chic is to sweat profusely in a warehouse with a barrel fire as centerpiece. I imagine it will be a very cozy winter spot, but it was not for me in the midst of a humid DC summer. Thank goodness I was seated upstairs and not stuck at the bar by the fire.  Service was attentive and pleasant, but felt very perfunctory and arms-length. The whole experience, upon reflection, smacked of a cash-grab more than a dining experience at a restaurant where the owner put their heart and soul into it.  It's a new place though, so there's a chance it will improve dramatically, but I won't be back until the dead of winter and even then only for a special occasion.",

Our waitress was upbeat and gave great information on the entire menu, and the rest of the service staff was really on top of things.  The menu was extensive, and everything I had on it was fantastic. The meal was well-paced, and the spreads/bread served as a great unifying element for each dish. Just be sure to pace yourself  The Harissa/lemon carrots and ribeye were standout dishes, with the ribeye being perhaps the best steak I've ever had. The fenugreek seasoning and perfect char were lovely. The cocktail menu is also inventive and has a wide range of options.  Finally, the restaurant has a great ambiance. It's well designed, the fires roaring in the middle look impressive, and the slightest smell of smoke makes it feel extremely cozy.  Reservations are a bit of a pain to come by, albeit understandably. It's also an expensive meal, but entirely worth it.",

We tried making reservations via online (official method) but to no avail. It goes to show how busy they are. So we decided to go anyway and walked to the restaurant (a good 45min) and to our fortunate luck someone had just canceled. We were welcomed and seated right away. Alrighty, now about the food! We had a lamb and goat spread (called Terkan...I think)  which was so yummy, with hummus, and ezme as a condiment. Also eggplant with a molasses sauce in which the flavor kind of grows on you with every bit. Then as our 'main' meal we had a whole chicken which smelled so good, and tasted good as well with a slight sweetness to it, which I'm thinking is cinnamon. For drinks we had the ginger beer with black tea which is probably the best ginger beer I've ever had...and I'm jamaican so I know good ginger beer when I taste it. The dessert was yumscrumpcious too! All in all it was a pleasing experience for my husband and I and if you're ever in DC we highly recommend coming here... it won't disappoint.",

The best thing is the condiments options, which you can order and add to any dish when eating to change the flavors. It is a delicious experiment. Thee  naan bread is very good, fresh and warm. The carrots we're amazing! And I never say that about vegetables. The steak was on of the most tasty steaks I have ever had. The food is very good but we found it expensive.",

I had high hopes for the service after reading a write-up in Food & Wine, but we had a waitress that must have been having an off day because she could not have been less interested in her job that evening and offered no information about the dining style. Their menu has a list of spreads and condiments and just looking at the menu you can tell they are meant to play a larger role in the meal than most restaurants. It's tapas style and they bring naan constantly (never-ending naan is always a good thing). Given the cuisine they feature spice also tends to be a factor. Having said all of that, it's helpful for the wait staff to advise the average size of the dishes (since some tapas restaurants have larger portions than others), give a few thoughts on the dips and condiments and advise the portion size for both, and to mention the constant supply of naan so you don't order a ton of dishes not realizing a large portion of the meal is automatically provided. There is a separate group of the wait staff that is responsible for keeping your water full and naan stocked and they did a great job. The food was good enough that I will consider going back; I assume our waitress was not a representation of their overall wait staff.",
