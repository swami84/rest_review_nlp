After settling in with a Mango Mimosa, we tried the pork and Ginger Dumplings with X.O. Sauce. Nice and spicy with that umami goodness. Next we enjoyed the Spicy Prawns and Minchi Mosca. The Prawns are one of those decadent dishes that you savor till the end. Wow! The minchi was that beautiful end to our brunch with the soft-cooked egg yolk rounding out the ground meat and spices. Lastly, service was excellent. Laura, one of the bartenders, guided us through the menu as well as our meal. Brunch does get a little expensive, but it is memorable!",

The sauce for Hamachi was a bit too tart for our taste, but I did like the pumpkin seeds in this dish(Boka restaurant also have the similar dish on their dinner menu with a different fish, and the flavor was better balanced).

A lot of the photos make the portion seems small but everything we ordered today was a rather decent sized portion. Including the steak and avocado dish. We also had the clams. The carrot toast doesn't taste much like carrot but it is absolutely amazing oh, so much so that I ordered another serving of carrot toast. The person who greeted us at the front door and sat us at our table I thought was just a host,. I was impressed when he jumped in and offered to take our order. Turns out his name was Tim, the general manager. Very professional, very passionate. As a business owner myself I know good customer service when I see it, or a lack thereof. This place was spotless, and the service from the bellboys to the waiters right up to management goes above and beyond. The bartender was also helpful.",

Highly recommend both! For second course, we devoured the WINTER SALAD of endives with red wine poached pears, blue cheese, toasted walnuts & calamansi vinegar and PORCINI RIGATONI with wild burgundy snails, mushroom bolognese & whipped parmesan. Highly recommend both! For our third course, we devoured the GREEN CIRCLE CHICKEN with red wine hollandaise, stuffed cabbage & smoked egg yolk and WILD ARTIC CHAR with brussels sprouts, smoked trout roe, crispy buckwheat & black walnuts.

The sweet potato tots are also really good; it's fried in a batter that makes the dish very fluffy and lighter than usual tater tots.  I loved the fried chicken sandwich.

The interior is stupidly beautiful. The lighting could be a bit brighter, but I'm sure that would defeat the purpose of the ambiance for the mood. The windows alone let in enough light to keep the place lit until Sunset. Moving onto the food, everything was as expected, for the most part. To start off with appetizers, we had ordered the Wild Burgundy Snails, Veal Sweetbreads, Hokkaido Scallop Crudo and the infamous Oyster Pie. Each dish was full of flavor and delicious. The only exception to this was the scallop crudo, which wasn't to my particular taste. I would've preferred it to be more smoky, but again, personal preference, no ill intent towards the dish. I also wish that the Oyster Pie were bigger. I had never realized how small it was until I had ordered it. For the price of it, you would assume a bigger slice (pictures are deceiving). Moving on to entrees, we had ordered three: Wild Arctic Char, Wagyu Tri-Tip and Lamb Loin. All three were equally amazing but if I had to pick, it'd be a split down the middle between the lamb and wagyu. Both were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. To finish off dinner, we ordered two desserts: Roasted Vanilla Pavlova and Tres Leches Cake. The Tres Leches Cake didn't really taste like Tres Leches, but that's not a bad thing, it was delicious none-the-less. The pavlova was very sweet, but not overly to the point of having a possible toothache afterwards. To end the night, we were presented with complimentary confections. The menu may be small, but it does the job. I had a party of four and this was a sufficient amount of food; however, I would have been more than happy to order at least two-to-three more items to taste.",

To my surprise there was Hannibal Lecter at the next table having the Sweet Breads. I kept a eye on him just in Case!! The Atlantic Char was very tasty in a flavorful broth. I will say our server Dalton was one of our best ever servers. He had excellent knowledge of the Menu. His timing was experienced and right on cue he arrived unhurried in a busy restaurant.",

They are killing it! Food aside, I really appreciate their thoughtful cards to their guests who celebrate their anniversaries and birthdays here. Love how coordinated the restaurant runs. I wouldn't be anymore excited to celebrate my birthday with my honey during Chicago Restaurant Week. Their Icelandic cod cioppino, carrot toast and chocolate mousse cake are the most notable items on the menu. Absolutely love the flavor of the carrot puree and blackened lime shavings on top of the toast. The Icelandic cod toast is incredibly buttery paired with a rich autumn pumpkin spiced soup. Thank you for the absolutely divine experience.",

But the worst was the foie gras : shaved like partisan cheese and too sweet ! I had a spaghetti chitarra ... I am Italian so difficult to judge cause I might be excessively demanding . Overall the food experience was poor and the price not proportional to the quality and preparation of the food .",

I STILL dream of this place and it\u2019s food. This restaurant deserves every award and accolade coming its way because it is absolutely one of the top restaurants in the US (not just Chicago).  Service is phenomenal and genuine. The people who work here 1. Truly appear to love what they do and 2. Truly appear to enjoy serving you and being friendly.  The food is... incredible. Anything I say here won\u2019t do it justice, so go there and get some yourself! \ud83d\ude0b The flavors are complex and continue to transform and surprise as you eat the meal.  One more thing - I loved and was surprised by the bathrooms. They\u2019re incredibly thoughtful, with wipes, hair ties, tampons, etc.  My ultimate thought is that this restaurant deserves a Michelin star. I\u2019ve been to other Michelin star restaurants that do less than this place, and definitely slip from my memory sooner. I\u2019ll be recommending this place and dreaming of its flavors for months and years to come, and I would definitely trip to Chicago purely to attend this restaurant again.",

First of all, we booked the place for 8:45pm noon Saturday night. However, we came an hour early a d they were able to seat us. We brought our 4 year old daughter and they were cool with it. be  Our serve, Gabby (spelling ?!?) was amazing, friendly and thoughtful. We had complimentary champagne and desserts as a part of our celebration, and all were delicious. We ordered the magical oyster pie (it's honestly really magical), tartare and a cocktail. We loved every sip and bite we had.  The place itself is so lovely, and well-decorated. A+ for the ladies room, they provided small emergency stuff there, like hairpin, mint, roller. Wonderful.  I'd love to come back again!",

This could all be overlooked if the food was top-notch, but the originality wasn't enough to justify the small menu and huge price. Oyster Pie and Calamansi Tart we're the high notes, but the tartare was stringy, pork was salty, fish was tough, pasta sauce tasted like lime juice, and the goat cheese salad was just a goat cheese salad.  3 stars for the benefit of the doubt that prices were jacked up to manage the over-hyped demand, which I get, but maybe they went too far for me.",

I am a pretty serious wine guy.  There are no heavy hitter wines on this menu but they did offer a wonderful wine menu that paired perfectly with the menu and they had for more French than I though possible there.  That's a great start.  Energetic enthusiastic staff another great plus.  Hip groovster d\u00e9cor by someone who know what they were doing.  All set the perfect stage for the food which I expected to be more flash than substance and was wrong.  Their signature Hawaiian rolls?  Well, I have never liked a sweet roll.  I would say these were the best of the genre that I've had.   Spring salad with goat cheese?  Sure its wonderful but its done everywhere.  New spin here and dead on.  Toasted granola was unexpected and I did not plan on liking it, but loved it.  We ordered an extra salad.  Cornish hen...nice but boring?  Nope, it was sublime.  Really spectacular.   Aged duck?  The few places that do duck in the US usually do it poorly.  This was perfectly seasoned, cooked, and presented in a new and fun way.  Seafood spaghetti was a bit disappointing so avoid.  Lamb belly was amazing.  Big thumbs up.  Deserts were also creative but grounded.  Too trendy for us? Yeah, probably.  Worth the trip?  Absolutely.  Change it up and every once in a while go hipster I say!",

At the time of this writing, Bellemore has been open for 4 weeks yet it already seems confident in flavor, aesthetic, and attitude. The menu is simple, split into three sections, and practically begging to be shared. We enjoyed a light and acidic Hiramasa crudo, which was paired with mandarins and marinated in vinegar. The Winter Salad was impressive for it's texture, variety, and presentation. Pumpkin seeds for crunch, beets for sweetness, whipped Gorgonzola for a smooth, salty finish along with tangy pomegranate seeds. Our server suggested we try the braised lamb belly, and with Greek chef Jimmy Papadopoulos at the helm, I was confident in the execution. It was succulent without being greasy and along with the savory persimmon marmalade and sheep's milk feta made for a balanced composition. The Chestnut papardelle was another textural success blending roasted pears with chestnuts and shaved truffle, creating a complex but satisfying flavor. Finally the duck done 3 ways had the feeling and finesse for a signature dish. Duck dry aged for 20 days fashioned into a fried croquette, a wonderfully crispy and flavorful duck breast with farro, and a decadent duck heart sausage. Desserts were also well executed and ornate, adding to the artistic flair of Bellemore's ambience. Service was excellent, thorough, and knowledgeable. The environments design is flawless with brief aberrations that add character. I will definitely be coming back!",

Service was very attentive and our server was able to make some good recommendations.  No gluten free or vegetarian menus but the server can guide you. Food was well presented and looked great on the plate.  Flavors well well balanced but not overly bold.  We tried multiple items from pasta (our daughter loved it) to 2 different fish dishes.  All tasted great. Cocktails were a bit below our expectations given the great drinks at Boka.  Wine and beer selection were good. For the price point, I would expect just a little bit more. Our check for 3 with tip was ~$350 with 2 drinks each.  Good for a special occasion.",
