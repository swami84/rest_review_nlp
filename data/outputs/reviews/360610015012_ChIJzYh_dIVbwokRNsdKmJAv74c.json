        "caption": "I've  ordered delivery from Indian Coffe house a few times now, and so I can finally write this review and say it is truly excellent.  Everything I've gotten here has been good. Paneer Masala, Saag Paneer (can you tell I like paneer? :P ), and they have plenty of paneer options. I also have had the potato and eggplant dish (forget what it's called), and it's all been good.  You can tell they really care about their food. Everything is super flavorful with lots of spice. It might bother some people for there to be a chunk of clove in their curry, but not me. You know they're using good, whole spices in there.  What's extraordinary is the quality for the price. I really appreciate that especially at this time in quarantine, when ordering delivery is more of a thing, and you really noticed the pricing across different restaurants. I love that they don't charge a delivery fee, and yet the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality.  One warning - their \"Medium spicy\" is quite spicy! So beware! But it's so good that even though it's a little too spicy for me, I still down it.  Love this place. Definitely my go-to Indian delivery!",
