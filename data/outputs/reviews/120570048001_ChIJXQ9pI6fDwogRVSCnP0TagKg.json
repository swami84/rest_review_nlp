Then guy put wayyyy too much garlic butter on it. Then put the meatballs on and I told him what kind of cheese and he was about to put it in the oven and I asked aren't you going to put the cheese on the bread? And he said more cheese? I said it's supposed to be cheesy garlic bread. And pointed at the picture. And he barely spoke english so the other two ladies would speak to him in spanish. Then he kinda lifted up the meatballs and put a couple CLUMPS of the shredded mozzerella on it. And also, the credit card machine was in spanish. Once I tried eating my sub, the only thing I could taste was garlic so I threw it away.",

The staff make a quick sandwhich yet they have taken the time to offer things to get customer loyalty on more than one occassion. Most places rarely act like anything more than a human conveyer belt making fast meals out of fast food choices! I think the last time I asked the order taker for BBQ sauce they looked confused at me then looked up at the menu behind them cause they didnt know how to ring it up to add it to my sandwhich. So I truly appreciate customer service and if they understand it's better to give an extra meatball here and there rather then throw 'em away my loyalty is won....good job Subway!",
