The only liquor is wine and there's not much of a selection. There are steps down into it so not a good choice for people who have difficulty with stairs but there's not many of them.  The wait staff is attentive without hovering, which I like. It is also just a few blocks from the promenade overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge Park.  Overall it's a nice place for a quick, tasty, casual dinner & a pleasant evening stroll on the promenade overlooking the lower Manhatten skyline.",

If you're getting curry, I recommend getting the wild mushroom & coconut soup to mix with it cause it's so delicious!  A La Panang ($14)- 3.5/5 I got the medium spicy and it was quite spicy.. had to start taking off my jacket and put my hair up! The spiciness starts to build up after each bite. It's really delicious mixed with coconut soup and less spicy. I wasn't too crazy about the veggies in it, I think it was zucchini and some random vegetables that I don't even know. The shrimp were good though. The brown rice came on the side and was okay, nothing special.  Crab Fried Rice in Young Coconut ($21)- 5/5 This was yummy! So much crab meat and the portion was quite big! They gave a little extra on the side too so my sister shared it with me. A little bit on the pricey side though for this dish.  Pinto Iced Tea ($6)- 5/5 This comes with ice cubes, cream, syrup and the tea itself. You pour the tea first, then add the cream! I didn't use any cream because it was seriously delicious the way it was and even before the milk! It was super fun and really good. Although it's very easy to finish and the portion is a bit small and also pricey iced tea. You can smash up the ice and make a slushie, which my server recommended me to do.  Creamy Tom Yum Soup ($8)- 3.5/5 This was sorta of the same Tom Yum soup I had in Thailand but a tad bit more sour. I loved the shrimp though! Portions are quite decent for the soup and they pour it at the table.  Wild Mushroom and Coconut Soup ($8) - 4/5 This was good, although still not the flavor I had when I went to Thailand. Really good coconut taste though.",

However, again we decided to try something new. First, it took some time for our server to take our order. When she finally came her responses were somewhat curt and she seemed a bit impatient as we asked questions about the menu.  Our meals arrived and I mut say I was unpleasantly surprised. The service was poor as well as the food. I will never return nor recommend this place to anyone.",
