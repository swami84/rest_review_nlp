From the employees holding the door for us walking in, to the cashiers, to the the cooks, to all the employees cleaning and keeping things safe, to everyone that came and checked on us on the patio and offered to clear our trays, THANK YOU! I rarely feel inspired to write reviews, but today was truly exceptional and I believe in supporting people who are doing good work. I haven\u2019t even gotten to the food yet, it was delicious, so fresh and the sauce... no words. Amazing! So again, thank you all and welcome to the neighborhood!

        "caption": "I have been a big fan of Raising Canes since early 2000's. Gotta love that toast and sauce. Been a VIC (Very Important Caniac) for a while. Was able to come to this location one day before the public opening and have dinner.  Very excited about this location because only a few miles away from the house. No need to travel out to the suburbs to grab yummy chicken tenders. My husband also is a fan and was excited when I annouced that we were grabbing takeout. We arrived to this location which is primely located near to Wrigley Stadium. We were able to find parking but could be an issue on a busy game day. I noticed that the street parking requires a permit further down the next block.  Decoration at this location is probably the best that I have seen. I have been to nearly 15 Canes in four different states. After Tempe, AZ location this one is the most glamorously decorated Canes. I will also say this the smallest one that I probably have ever been in.  No drive through that I noticed but outside dining was nice.  Food: We got a Box each (4 strips, fries, cole slaw, bread, sauce) we always sub cole slaw for either more fries or additional bread. I like more bread and hubby wants more fries. Husband had famous sweet tea and I made Arnold Palmer with unsweetened tea. Food good as always. Sauce was on point. Husband thought tenders were smaller than normal, however I thought they were comparable to the ones in AZ.  This location is going to be a hit for this neighborhood. As soon as ballgames are rolling we will visit again. I am sure folks will be getting their Canes before and after the game. The prices here are fantastic. Out bill was less than $20 and I had leftovers (2 tenders and 1 bread). Enjoy folks!!!",
