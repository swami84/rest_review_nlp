They have super fresh ingredients and their menu is a welcome change from typical burgers, pizza, bbq, etc. Plenty of choices for everyone and the seafood has always been fresh and extremely delicious. They have smaller kids meals, just the right size. Their tator tots are fantastic and the portions are perfect for human beings! Salmon, cod and shrimp, along with their fish and chips were spot on! And given I am an onion hater, I love that they don\u2019t ruin their fresh veggies by saut\u00e9ing them with onions!! Great for when you want a lighter meal, but don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a filling meal...just doesn\u2019t weigh you down!",
