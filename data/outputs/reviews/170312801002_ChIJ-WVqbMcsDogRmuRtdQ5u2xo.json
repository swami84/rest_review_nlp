But nothing can explain $2 for side of hummus (so small that I thought it was extra dressing at first) which didn't matter anyway, because it tasted nothing like hummus, I ended up throwing it way. Really the only thing that I actually liked were olives, had to pay extra for those, but they tasted good... Probably cause there is no cooking involved, they just placed them on top of my order. Rest was pretty bad and I'm usually easy to please.",
