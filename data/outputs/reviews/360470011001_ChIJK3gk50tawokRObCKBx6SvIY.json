They were out of what I ordered (after I was able to successfully place order). Instead of calling me to let me know-perhaps to order something different, they kept the order. The courier arrived and was waiting to deliver the food, I was waiting to receive the food. My girlfriend (she ordered) messaged the courier to see what the hold up was after an 1 hour and 10 minutes - they said they were waiting. I then called the restaurant and asked them - they responded by saying \"we're out of what you ordered.\"  Incredibly poor communication on their end - I know Uber Eats allows them to contact folks for situations exactly like this. They didn't proactively reach out or cancel the order either - if they were out of something and had no intention of reaching out to see if I wanted to exchange something, why wait to cancel the order? They kept both me and the courier waiting. I reached out to management to provide honest feedback - ensure their staff knows how to use 3rd delivery platforms to avoid situations like this in the future-never heard from them.  Never got to try the food, the shop was closed shortly after speaking with a representative from the restaurant. Two stars since they did end up cancelling the order - but only after I called and waited 1 hr and 10 min. Again, if they didn't make the order because they didn't have the food, confused why they didn't just cancel the order right there and then. The food looked good, but honestly, plenty of other juice/healthy food bars around Brooklyn.",

I would recommend anyone to go here whenever they can. I\u2019m very picky with where I eat. Places have to be clean and I have to feel a sense of respect when I\u2019m there. Some restaurants treat you like another number, or they rush through your order without care and making sure things are done in order and in a sanitary area. This juice shop hit all those key points. I felt comfortable and safe eating my a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl. Didn\u2019t have to question if the fruits were washed or fresh or not cuz you can just see it when you come in. Whoever is in charge should legit give the two employees here a raise cuz some bosses can be trash sometimes. But I hope this place is run by someone with as much cleanliness, care and integrity as their shop portrays. That is all. To anyone reading this....ever...just come to this shop lol",

I approached the counter to order the employees attitude was a bit discouraging to begin with but she's human, it's Saturday so I gave her the benefit of the doubt, ordered my  smoothie and mushroom avocado toast as well as purchased three juices. My husband and I sat aside while we waited for our order. We could see that there were a few people before us so we definitely knew patience would be key in this situation.  Sitting and waiting for about 15 mins, I notice similar orders being made that looked like what we ordered. But each one was handed off to someone else. We noticed the faces around us changing and then realized that people who had come in after us were being served. Again I see an order just like mine being made so I walk over it's handed to someone else. As I'm going to say something to the  cashier/food preparer she begins to ask me what did I order again. \"You can't be serious!\"  Not only did you see me sitting there, you actually don't even have record of my order. An entire 40 minutes had passed. All with my husband and I being patient and this woman has the nerve to ask what I ordered again. Everyone else that walked in and waited had their order ticket taken care of.  I tell her my order she begins to attempt to make it but still with this nasty attitude. I ask for a refund, her response \"OK Cool.\" DEFINITELY NOT COOL MORON. She was unapologetic and very dismissive. I stood at the register waiting for my order. If it weren't  enough blatant disrespect already displayed, she then attempts to take someone else's order over me, before she issues my refund. I politely tell her \"that's rude, don't take an order over me before you're finished dealing with the situation at hand.\"  She had to then call her manager via her cell phone to ask how to issue a refund. The customer asked me how long I was waiting and for what, I told him and he left. Rightfully so. This place use to be a favorite and super convenient but has gone to the dogs. NOTE TO CORPORATE: DO NOT LEAVE UNRELIABLE UNPROFESSIONAL AND INCAPABLE STAFF TO HANDLE A SMALL SHOP LIKE THIS ON ANY DAY ESPECIALLY NOT A SATURDAY!  I hate that I've had to result to a bad review as my first review ever. But this was a moment of outright disrespect and lack of accountability. Won't be going to any other Juice Shop again.",

I order a drink and gave them my name and I was sitting down waiting for my drink. They had 6 + workers and they were all making samples and drinks for their friends. I am a PAYING customer, they need to re-evaluate their priorities. They need to first assist PAYING customers, not their friends or some free samples. I waited 10 mins and I went back to the cashier named \u201cWendy\u201d, Hispanic-looking lady. I asked her where my drink was, she was extremely rude and said they called my name and walked away with no apology and she had an attitude.I would have let it go if I got an apology on the spot. None of the staff wanted to give me the rude cashier\u2019s name and the cashier was hiding in the corner. I had to get the name from the manager. I was sitting there for ten minutes waiting for my drink and no one called my name. What got me extremely angry is they handed drinks out to their \u201cfriends\u201d and customers after me.  They need better organization and workflow and better customer service.",

I walked back to the store and was promptly asked by the cashier (who at this time happened to be the manager and not shift supervisor as she stated) what was wrong. I informed her that I order a chicken kale bowl and this had tuna. Maybe I got someone else order. She never tried the salad in front of me. All she told me was that our \"tuna\" doesn't look like this. I said ok, well somehow tuna was in my salad. Maybe it was from the tongs, the bucket, or just the wrong salad. Can you just make me the correct salad. She then went on with well it's going to be just like that so do you want a refund. I remind her again that my friend paid for lunch and wasn't sure if he paid cash or card. This is when Rasheda (the \"Manager\") dismiss me and said well we can only give a refund to your friend, there nothing I can do for you, leave before I call the cops to have you removed. All of this happened in front of all of her staff, who instead of directing them to work as there was now a line of 6 people waiting. I asked her for her name, emp ID or a number to corp. She never gave it too me, I had to get her name from another employee.  The service at this store by the manager (Rasheda Andrews) is horrendous! She also yells at her staff in public (witness the day before as she was scolding her male employee over a previous customer complaint) by the door while she was sitting directly across from a customer who was trying to enjoy their lunch.  What has happened to this location? I never got my refund or my salad.",
