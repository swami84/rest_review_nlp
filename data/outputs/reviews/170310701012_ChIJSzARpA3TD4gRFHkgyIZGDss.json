I was grilling who i think is the owner wbout how i wanted my wings made (cause im a wing connoisseur) and he assured me he knew what he was doing then asked where i was from. I told him the Northside amd he proceeded to say Buffalo Joes has the best wings on the Northside (which is true... they really have the best wings EVER...until today) i got my wings and walked out and ate them in the car and INSTANTLY KNEW I FOUND SOMETHIMG BETTER THAN BUFFALO JOES. I came back with my gf and ordered 2 more orders and he was so nice enough to give me free fries on the house and even ran out our orders to our car!! The taste of the wings with the hospitality earns this man a 5 stars. Im big on respect and he did more than enough to make me feel like a valued customer on my first experience there. I LOVE these experiences",

The buffalo was exceptionally bland, lacking the tang of even your neighborhood Frank\u2019s Red backyard cookout wings, but the barbecue was slightly better. Neither had the complexity or flavor profile one would expect after eating at Jake Melnick\u2019s or Crisp (two restaurants who could credibly claim the honor of best Chicago wings). Overall, the experience was standard bar fare - if passing this place late at night and by happenstance, I would gladly walk in and grab something to eat (likely a small serving of the barbecue wings, and then an unrelated menu item). But I wouldn\u2019t suggest anyone uber or walk out of their way to come here.",
