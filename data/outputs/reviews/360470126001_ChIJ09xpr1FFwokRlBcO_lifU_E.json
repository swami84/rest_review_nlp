The best Yemeni food ive ever had. Not sure how the next chef/owner will be but its saddening to see such great food disappear",

Our prior experiences were fantastic, however yesterday's visit was very disappointing.  Quality of the food has certainly degraded, food was cold and did not taste as good as we had previously expereinced. Rice tasted terrible and salad was awful and stale, even something as basic as chutney looked like bad green salsa.  The staff although were friendly and courteous but we got the sense that the restaurant management is not the same, it was disappointing that they declined to sell us the large four person plate with mix meats/chicken/fish as they claim they only serve it for lunch, even tho we have gotten it in the past during the evening hours. For two adults with kids that was the perfect balanced order.  In the end we were charged twice as much as we have usually paid in the past for the same comparable food, all while our plates looked as if they were barely touched on the way out.  The totally empty restaurant (during peak dinner time) as we walked in perhaps was the bad omen we should have picked up on, something we have neve seen in prior visits.",
