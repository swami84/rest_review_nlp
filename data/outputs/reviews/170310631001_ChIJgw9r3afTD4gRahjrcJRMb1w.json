Since app doesn\u2019t allow to order 2 sauces for 16 piece Boneless chicken, did phone in to store and place an order alongside of Garlic Parmesan sauce( I don\u2019t want to comment on Customer service either via phone or in-person experience, in short they least worried about customer). Finally what I received is a Spicy Garlic sauce. For second time, for same order, Garlic sauce that goes along with boneless wings doesn\u2019t have a sufficient amount of sauce that it should go with. Told the same but no difference. Today I order a large pizza (garlic buttery blend) with 3 toppings back plus a side of Boneless wings. But the base wasn\u2019t a Garlic one instead it\u2019s a plain one. I complained when placed 2nd Order but nothing is changed. But I gave a chance for 3rd time, another ignorance on the same line. So I don\u2019t think will make a next visit in future. And I also recommend, if some thinks to place order, THINK twice.",

But they were completely destroyed, as if somebody had juggled with the box.  I called the store. They sent new pizzas, and I gave them the destroyed pizzas back.  The new pizzas arrived, again destroyed -- and now almost 2 hours since I first ordered.  I called the store.  The manager wanted to give me another credit (for more than the cost of the pizza).  I agreed to take a credit, again, but only for the cost of the pizzas I ordered.  A couple weeks later:  Called by phone to order and use the credit. Guess what, there's no record of any credit.  And the shift manager isn't authorized to address the problem.  Wow.  My experience/opinion:  avoid this store, unless you want to get ripped off.",
