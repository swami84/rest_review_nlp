She did not take a moment to listen to the order or even find out whose food went to whom. At one point, she even pulled down her mask and rubbed her nose while packaging the orders. I don't expect perfection from restaurants, but professionalism and being courteous to your customers should be the common values of a business. I will not come back to this location. Do yourself a favor and go to the other location near the Walgreens on 135th, they're quick and pleasant.",

When I ordered and you seen my note you should have not sent it, just like I told you I didn't want cabbage which you abided by, you should of done the same with my order. I've ordered through Uber eats with restaurants before and if they didn't have what I wanted they called me,so I don't understand why you establishment couldn't do the same.
