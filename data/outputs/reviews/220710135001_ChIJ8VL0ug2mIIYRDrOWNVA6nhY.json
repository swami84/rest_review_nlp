However, we were devastated to have had by far the most rude, condescending, and passive aggressive service I've ever had at a restaurant.  We dined on the afternoon of Sunday, February 22nd.  Were it not in the thick of the Mardi Gras tourist season, I would have asked to speak with the manager, as our server was very rude to us, seemingly for bringing empty drink cups from tropical island, despite us ordering drinks from the restaurant. Ironically, only one of those drinks was served to us, because our server never seemed to care about us or treat anyone with respect. Outside of having the old empty drinks though, I wasn't sure why, because all of us we're very polite and cordial, complimenting the food only to be met with dirty looks. I guess it didn't matter to them because our party of six was enough for them to bake-in a 20% gratuity charge that we could not contest. I most certainly would not have tipped anything extra, and in fact would have demanded some of my money back, were it any other time of the year. A truly terrible representation of New Orleans service culture.  tl;dr - DO NOT GO HERE!!  Would give 0 Stars if possible for terrible and rude service, but the food and location is a 4 star experience at worst.",

After all this, the waiter than double charged my meal and when called out on it said \"Dont worry this happens all the time\" WHAT!?! (Still waiting for the pending charge of that to come off my account) We then asked for change for a $5  he gave us change for a $10, because we are honest people we corrected his obvious inability to count $ and gave him the difference which just made him more confused.

We showed up asking for a table inside for 4, and the guy who greeted us (no host) seemed bewildered we were there and said so and so should be happy to seat us, shouldnt she? To which so and so looks just as bewildered with a yes, I can? Good, great, that was awkward.  There was a table available, but 2 in our party had to share a bench and one side of the table, as the only other 4 seater table was taken by 2 people, one also on the bench and one at the only one of 3 chairs that intersected with our table (so we had to share our table with her back to us on one of 4 sides). There were seats at the bar that they wouldnt seat anyone in even though they were busy...why have them then?  There were 3 service people, all who waited on us at one point, no idea who our actual waiter/waitress was supposed to be. Everyone was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The guy took our order and we waited. And watched our food sit for SEVERAL minutes getting cold, wondering who was supposed to bring it to us. I guess they were waiting for our 4th plate to come out with it, which it never did, because he forgot to put it in. So 3 of us got to eat our cold food as the guy said the 4th was \"coming right out\" for a whole 15 minutes because \"the egg broke.\" It was obvious at a certain point it was completely forgotten, but why keep making us think it'll be out in a second when it'll clearly be another 15 minutes. Our one out of town guest had to sit hungry and wait while we all ate our cold food.  Our other out of town guest was a vegan, which why we chose this restaurant in the first place. She said her food tasted very fishy, and was definitely cooked in the same pan as fish. Not very vegan friendly after all.  For $60+ for 4 breakfasts with only water, I'd take my business elsewhere in the future.",

They didn't want to give us meals without certain ingredients my vegan pal couldn't eat. Everything is insanely overpriced - I paid over $40 for a tiny plate of potatoes with grated cheese and a plate of lettuce - couldn't eat the sausages because again, too spicy and they never said they were.

The cork was bone dry and the smell was obviously oxidized. Tried another wine and it was good.  BUT they guy shows up with an already opened bottle that was not full and tries to pour it. It\u2019s either a scam with their wines or they are just terrible. Very rude staff except for one bus boy.  Maybe we got them at an off night but I see a few really bad reviews so maybe not.

The pasta was okay but not worth the price. It was definitely way too heavy for the heat. Especially since they were only seating people outside. It's in a convenient spot, and I am glad they have vegan options. However I regret not going up the street to try Piscobar instead. If you're looking for fantastic food and atmosphere, I cannot recommend Carmo enough and suggest you go there instead of Green Goddess.",

The staff was very fun, knowledgeable and helpful. When we got there there were no tables so we were going to carry the food elsewhere and they said no and brought a table out for us, and water for the dogs. We cannot wait to go back. The best thing was that we were there during Mardi Gras but when you get to this restaurant it feels so private and far away, you can\u2019t even hear any of the noise of the party going on just a very short distance away, it was so relaxing.",

        "caption": "We got there and were told that a table would be free after 15 mins by the female server. Bartender was really nice and made our drinks while we waited. Once a table was free the bartender then told us to sit down at the table. However, the service went downhill from there, we were not given water for the table, utensils or a menu for a good 15-20 mins. We even tried to flag someone down but were completely ignored. Had even watched a couple get seated, served water, given a menu and looked like they even ordered their food before anyone gave us any attention. Finally, we had ordered dinner with a bottle of white wine. I could not help but feel disliked by the female waitress who served us the wine but waited a while before returning with the ice bucket till after we told our passing bartender that we were waiting for it. The waitress finally got us our ice bucket but set it on the table when we already had been running out of table space. I thought it was funny since she had given the table next to us an empty seat to hold their bucket when there were other empty seats available around us too. We ended up having to put it on the floor. Food arrived and it was good. However, once we had finished our meal the waitress came over with the check including 20% service charge. Again, I thought it was even more funny since she didn\u2019t bother asking if we wanted dessert or anything else to drink but spent time with all the other tables other than ours. When asking to take off the included 20% tip we were given attitude by the male busboy and no one wanted to even talk to us afterwards, practically slamming the check on the table when she brought it back.  Left the restaurant not wanting to return and made sure we left some tip with our bartender because she was the only one who made any effort. For some reason, I can\u2019t help feeling it was because I\u2019m Asian as every table had been served soo much better than mine. We were given the explanation that it was due to the Jazz Fest event but very hard to believe when smiles/attention were everywhere but at our table.",

The Lithuanian manager/server deserves a special mention as he made sure that any of the 8 of us will NOT ever be dining there again! Aggressive, condescending, patronizing and extremely unprofessional are just a few of the adjectives we can use to describe his behavior. We waited around 30min for a table on a Saturday afternoon which was no problem at all... once seated we waited around 30min for somebody to take our food order... we were not asked for other drinks and when eventually we managed to order more drinks they messed that up too. We waited around 1hour 20min for food and when asking how long food would take the Lithuanian chap suggested we walk to McDonald\u2019s if we prefer... They automatically added a $60 tip onto our bill which was 20% of the bill but we felt this was totally unjustified because of the terrible service. We also asked before we ordered that the bill be split and that we were separate parties but upon completion of the bill they did not split it and then said we could only use a maximum of 5 credit cards which is no problem but was never mentioned at all in the beginning. What a shame as the food was great but service and people skills shocking and very embarrassing for a restaurant. We will not be coming back and suggesting that everybody avoid at all costs. The staff ended up finger pointing and asking us to leave. We did so gladly...",

During my stay, I had the beet hummus and assorted fresh vegetables and toasted bread (pic attached) from the starters offerings, the freekah salad, of course from the salad offerings, and the rolled uttapam (pic attached) and the local grilled lemongrass tofu poboy, both from the plates offerings. OMG, SO DELICIOUS!  The restaurant isn\u2019t 100% vegan, but they have several vegan dishes and offer to make several of their other dishes vegan upon request. This is great, especially if you\u2019re visiting with people who aren\u2019t vegan, everyone can still eat together. Friendly staff! I highly recommend The Green Goddess!! I only gave it 4 stars because the inside of the restaurant is quite small, but they do have a few tables & chairs outside under large umbrellas, so that if it\u2019s a nice day and you don\u2019t mind eating outside, you can do that.",

The staff was attentive and very patient while I sat down and waited for my party. The Indian-style dish I ordered was delicious. The kale salad was very colorful and tasty as well. The menu offered a variety of choices for different kinds of eaters, including vegetarian and vegan. We came here on a Sunday evening at around 5:30pm. There was no line. However, you should probably expect a line if you plan to eat on a Saturday evening. I highly recommend this restaurant.",
