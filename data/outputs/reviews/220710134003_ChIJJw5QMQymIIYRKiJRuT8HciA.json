The service was poor at best, the entrees we ordered came out after an extensive wait, they did not know who ordered what. The wine we had ordered they served out of decanters and the refills of both water and wine were hars to come by. There was no check on how the food was, by the time desert was offered and ordered it had been a near eternity. The coffee and desert we ordered were also slowly served and the 2 coffees came out after the deserts (by about 5-10 minutes) As part of the reservation for the birthday a request for a bottle champagne was ignored and no recognition of the reservation requests was made. The food I would call adequate but the service was just bad. Overall fairly disappointing",

Your already serving bread at the table why would you put more bread on it.  Had the bone marrow it was tasty but cooked for to long. one half of a bone is not enough. There is literally  just about a table spoon of edible food on this. did not come as pictured on their site.  We both had the short ribs and lobster. The rib was excellent and the portion adequate.  The lobster was undercooked and the portion was not sufficient.  two small bites was not enough. don't mind the raw part, I eat real sushi. but others might have issues with this.  Had an espresso coffee after dinner. It was good but rediculess amount. Who serves less than a half of a tiny cup of espresso? This was less than one tiny sip This cup should  have come full. Disappointed again. Barely a taste of coffee.  The service was excellent, the staff amazing. I overlooked the flaws of the meal because of them. Because of these many flaws I should have removed 2 stars, but because of the staff I'm only removing 1  For the cost, the food and portions should be spot on. I go to these places to eat odd foods, I expect to taste those thing in the dishes I also expect enough to be able to enjoy it.",

Our dinner at R'evolution was by far one of the most high quality experiences I've had in the city.  Not only was the food fabulous but the wait staff was incredible.  If your in town and looking for a tremendous experience with food that makes it even better, don't miss this one.  I would even recommend calling ahead and ask for our waiter, Kevin and his team... He and his team gave us just the right amount of time between conversions and also were quick with recommendations both on and off menu. Kevin even selected a great wine for myself while was more than appreciate.  Worth more than 5 stars and should be one your top 5 must visits for all you foodies out there... Get the Crab Beignets, Beef TarTar and  any entree... Can't go wrong!!",

We are former residents of the New Orleans area, and were trying to do our part to support area restaurants upon our Christmas time visit. This was our first time dining at R'evolution, and it failed to live up to our expectations. The atmosphere is great, very beautiful. The two servers who assisted us upon arrival were great, but then the \"main\" wait person stepped in to take over and was lackluster at best. He complained about working on Christmas Eve, didn't have his jacket buttoned correctly, looked a bit unkept for this caliber of an establishment, couldn't answer questions about the dishes offered, and made some peculiar comments. Also disturbing was the fact that one of the servers at another table kept pulling her mask off, and of the two cooks we could see from our table, one simply wasn't wearing a mask, and the other kept running his hands through his hair - we were not too happy about either. The food itself was actually pretty bland in our opinion, and although we have eaten in many fine dining estabishments all over the world, we also thought it was over priced for the quaility, flavor, and presentation, and we certainly don't mind paying for good food. We were surprised that this was the experience we had, especially in light of the Covid situation.",

Great variety of dishes to choose from for sure but the actual food was good but not 5 stars good. Overall flavors were nothing to write home about and most dishes were served not very hot.

From the second you walk in the door you will experience service from people who are truly passionate about your experience and love what they do. To start with they have delicious and creative cocktails, along with the classics, if you cant choose from their more than impressive wine selection. You wont even have to wait for appetizers because you are greeted with bread service of house made bread and butter. There is a whole cheese cart and beautiful house made charcuteries drying in visible coolers in parts of the dining room Our meal was amazing, I was moved to tears by how perfectly everything was cooked and paired. The plank redfish was succulent and smokey and the scallops were cooked to perfection. I wish we would have had time to enjoy their full dessert selection but we were still treated to a handmade jewelry box, each compartment containing a small desert just for visiting.  I would have eaten here more on our trip had I known how good it was earlier. Do yourself a favor and go eat here.",

The restaurant itself is beautiful consisting of multiple themed rooms, we sat in the kitchen room and just loved it. Our waiter Deshaun was extremely friendly and knowledgeable helping us choose from an extensive menu based upon our tastes. I started with the turtle soup with quail eggs, beautifully presented and equally delicious. My wife had a deliciously light and beautiful crab beiegnets appetizer, which was like nothing either of of have ever experienced, just delicious. For our main course I had 3 variations of quail while my better half had a delicious shrimp and tasso risotto which she loved. Choose anything you'd like from the menu I'm certain they're equal delicious and all beautifully presented. Although we just returned we're both already looking forward to returning and revolutions will definitely be one of the restaurants we plan to revisit.",

We had multiple servers who kept the meal running smoothly as we transitioned from course to course. While I\u2019d like to say I started off with the $650 Tricentennial Sazerac, I started with the $16 Charred Citrus Old Fashioned. That drink was everything!! They also brought us various types of breads, with French Butter and a Cane Sugar Butter. 2 of the 3 breads were really good. The gumbo was good, but not the best I\u2019ve had. However, I did enjoy how they served it (poured the roux on table side). The crab beignets were a letdown because they tasted more like grease than anything else. For my entree, I had the Triptych of Quail. Ummmmm, I\u2019m kinda at a lost for words. It was very basic and average. For $37, I expected a lot more. The dessert menu glowed which was super cool. I had the Creole Cream Cheese Bread Pudding Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was literally all of that in one...very different, but I enjoyed it. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to return here again.",

I haven't had anything to eat there that wasn't perfection...favorites...blue crab beignets, oysters, death by gumbo, foie grois,, and their take on pho.  UPDATED TO ADD: Their brunch is AMAZING. Seriously underrated. Go. Go!!!!!",

The service was excellent. You are waited upon by a team of excellent servers. The food was excellent as well. The beet salad is excellent. If you like oysters try their Revolution raw oysters. They top an oyster with shaved frozen bloody Mary juice. As the shave ice starts to melt it releases the flavor of the Bloody Mary. Then chew the oyster to combine the flavors. Outstanding.",

The menu was beautifully balanced to accommodate the many different taste preferences at our table.  Service was impeccable.  And the food arrived with a flourishing delivery, almost too pretty to eat...but we did and everything was fantastic.

This restaurant is a world secluded onto its own, and these people are professionals. They don't mess around.  I saw tables with staircases of food, they served appertifs and the waitress picked up on dietary restrictions without even asking about them. Service was some of the best I've seen in the world. Steaks seem to be their strong point but all other food was on point and artistically beautiful. Pricing was around $90 a person after tip, but well worth it.  Only a few feedback items - it was cold in the restaurant, we really would have loved some music, and I wish the burger was still on the menu!",

We came in a large group to celebrate a friend's birthday. They were very accommodating. Because we stayed told closing, they have us a mini tour of their private dining area and their kitchen. We did not enjoy most of the food. The sauces on the food are too overpowering and did not complement the food well. The only thing I loved was the raw oysters with their homemade granita sauce. Everything else was just too overwhelming in flavors. Especially for food with a southern flair. Sometimes simple really is better. The men especially did not enjoy their meals.

Go to the restaurant and bring your appetite.   It is difficult to have room to try each section, but do it anyway.  I love the death by gumbo!  I love the fired oysters, the charcuterie is diverse and has deep flavor.  The paneed veal is awesome is large, tender, and a show stopper.  Take a group of friends that like food and enjoy sharing their plates.  Once you see the menu you will understand.  By the way, the wine menu is thoughtfully prepared and presented with skill.  Buon Appetito!",

Some of the staff seem like they have been working there too long - acted disinterested not welcoming. The bbq / baked oysters were very good but not as good as at Casamentos. Gumbo very good but a bit salty, Pasta with duck and mushrooms was excellent. Gulf fish also very good. \u2014 Tried brunch a few days later and the soft scrambled eggs were so creamy - the very special Pimms Cup was no longer being made because that bartender had left the restaurant a few months ago. Restaurant still good but not great the way it used to be for the past several years.",

The disappointment started when our server changed during the appetizer course. There seemed to be no communication, because both main servers repeated the same dish descriptions.  Our appetizers took longer than expected, which we were informed was due to the sweetbreads taking more time.  However, when the appetizers arrived, everything was cold except the sweetbreads.  I'm not sure if everything else was cooked first and sat waiting for the sweetbreads, but I would expect a restaurant at this level to be able to properly time their food.  We couldn't send it back, as there was 4 of us, so we had each eaten our beignet and oyster.  For the soup course, they brought us 2 wrong soups, which they did rectify after we had eaten a few confused spoonfuls wondering why there was no oyster in our oyster stew.  The mains were fine, if not highly average.  The lobster was tough and overcooked.  One of our sides, the gratin never came.  Based on the reviews, we were expecting great things. I don't know if New Years Eve threw them off, but it was possibly the most disappointing meal of our trip considering our expectations, especially compared to our near perfect meals at GW Fins and Brennan's.",

        "caption": "This was our first visit to the Restaurant R'evolution on our first night in New Orleans.  It is located in the French Quarter section of New Orleans.  The first thing that I noticed when I approached the restaurant was that there was no neon sign identifying it, the sign was lit by the street light, the same way that the shops on the street have been lighted since the 1800's.  I can only describe this restaurant as elegant.  Your every need is addressed from the time you enter to the time you leave.  All the food is cooked to perfection and served in style.  Service is provided by a team of servers, so your everything is on time.  After our cocktails were served and we were reviewing the menu, we were served a Veal amuse-bouche, a gift from the Chef.  It was delicious.  The Fiorchatta bread was served with a sweet butter, regular butter and Virgin Olive Oil.  I could have made a meal out of the combination of Fiorchatta bread and sweet butter alone.  For an appetizer I had Oysters on the Half Shell R'evolution Style: Radish Chimichurri Salsa and Bloody Mary Granita.  A really unique taste for a person who normally likes his oysters plain, definitely worth another round.  For the main course we both had the 8-oz Filet Mignon with Gruyere Potato au Gratin.  I also had a side of Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms.  Both steaks were cooked to perfection.  Only a few steakhouses can properly prepare a Pittsburg style steak (charred on the outside with a cool red center) and the Restaurant R'evolution is one of them.  For desert my wife had the Creole Cream Cheese Bread Pudding Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It looked different from most bread puddings she has had, but she loved the taste.  I had a special desert called the Crown Royal, or something like that.  It was a brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that had a center of peanut butter covered in chocolate with pecans, decant.  I also had a cup of Irish Coffee.  While preparing the bill, they gratuitously brought a 4 compartment \"jewelry box\" with baked treats in each compartment.  They don't want you to leave hungry.  Considering the ambience, service, quality of the food (especially the preparation of the steak) and the price, I have given them 5 stars and we will definitely be returning the next time we are in New Orleans and I highly recommend that if you get a chance experience this restaurant.",

At first we were all a bit surprised walking through the kitchen but the room was sealed off and very private making for one of the best dining experiences we have had in a very long time. The room was finished similar to the restaurant. There was a view of both kitchens from our area (one via TV and one via windows). Food was wonderful. We followed most of our servers reccamendations. We tried shrimp and grits, swordfish, steak, lobster gnocchi, the crab beer battered beignets, and the gumbos. Everything was amazing. We had ice creams and the bread pudding creme brulee for desert. They also had us stopping to enjoy the food. Our son was floored at how good it all was and so were we. Service was impeccable even on a room separated from the rest of the restaurant and they never missed a beat each time we thought we would need something they were there to provide.",

The food is good, but I don't think it was worth the $100 dollar price tag. I say this because we did not even order true \"entrees.\" (For reference me and my girlfriend ordered 2 coktails, a charcuterie board, crab Beignets, a salad, and bread pudding). The coktails were very good!!! As was the board, Beignets, and salad. Bread pudding was a let down and I have definitely had better around the city. In all, it's very classy and it will no doubt be a remarkable meal in most areas, but for the money I'd say just have TWO nights out at less expensive and more cozy restaraunts around town - especially if you want some authentic New Orleans Cuisine for less than an arm and a leg.",

This is how my choice came to this restaurant in the middle of the French Quarter. The welcome is cordial, the servers are efficient and discreet, present without omnipresent people, available. We see immediately that they have undoubtedly made a school in the restoration. Being familiar with fine food, we are not at all comfortable with the glitter and overrated it. In this restaurant we were at ease from start to finish, the dishes are delicious and plentiful (America obliges). If I were to be fussy, I would say that the service is a bit quick. The dishes follow fairly quickly. We like to take our time, the French, even for meals at home !!! We would definitely stay at this restaurant on a future trip.  Hug & Mag  (Original) Etant familier avec les restaurants gastronomiques en France et plusieurs fois d\u00e9\u00e7u par ce qui devait \u00eatre les meilleurs restaurants dans les pays anglo-saxons (sans chauvinisme) j'ai parcouru le net en long en large et en travers et recoup\u00e9 des dizaines d'avis pour trouver le bon restaurant afin f\u00eater dignement les 30 ans de ma compagne. C'est ainsi que mon choix s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9 sur ce restaurant en plein French Quarter. L'accueil est cordial, les serveurs sont efficaces et discrets, pr\u00e9sents sans \u00eatres omnipr\u00e9sents, disponibles. On voit tout de suite qu'ils ont sans aucun doute fait une \u00e9cole dans la restauration. Etant familier avec la nourriture fine, nous ne sommes pas pour autant \u00e0 l'aise avec les paillettes et le surfait. Dans ce restaurant nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 notre aise du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin, les plats sont d\u00e9licieux et copieux (Am\u00e9rique oblige). Si je devais \u00eatre tatillon, je dirais que le service est un peu rapide. Les plats s'enchaine assez rapidement. On aime bien prendre notre temps nous les fran\u00e7ais, m\u00eame pour les repas \u00e0 la maison!!! Nous reviendrions sans h\u00e9siter dans ce restaurant lors d'un prochain voyage.  Hug & Mag",

The husband had the beef cheeks stroganoff with a porcini puree around the plate. The noodles and the beef cheeks were good. I did not care for the porcini puree. It was flat and lackluster in flavor. My beef and prawn tournedo with the lobster Thermidor sauce was okay. The prawn had too much Pernod liquor in the mealy stuffing and the beef medallion was very small. The presentation was very pretty though. I think I should have asked Johnny our server what was his favorite on the menu. My husband picked this restaurant because it was highly rated on Google and also Zagat rated. I wouldn't have given it this high of a rating based on the food. It was very busy at night and there was a big investment party in one of their rooms. Perhaps the chef did not prepare our meals.",

The wine list by the glass was extensive and very good, presented on an iPad. I had the charcuterie plate, they do the means in-house. They were very good, but I didn't love all of the meats. I had the quail done 3 ways. It was very special and amazingly well done. This place is a solid choice for NOLA!",

The restaurant was incredivly accomdating to add two more to the reservation. To top it all off, they took us to the \"chec's office to dine,\" which meant we walked through the kitchen, up the stairs, and behind a door to a private room. It was such a surprise. Wonderful food and service the entire time.  It wasn't until we left that I became unsatisfied. 3/5 of my party left while I stayed behind to clean up the table for our wonderful servers. My boyfriend and I walked down the stairs into the kitchen where the entire kitchen staff began to complain about our table and how we \"didn't deserve the service we enjoyed.\" One man raised his hand in front of everyone and told hem to \"shhhh\" while my boyfriend and I walked down the stairs. I turned back to say, \"no, no, continue...\" to which a staff member said, \"we could go on all night.\"  It was an incredible meal with incredible people along the way before the entire staff started to complain about the accommodation that fell into our laps. A note to the restaurant: if you're going to bring guests through the nooks and crannies as part of an experience, make sure your staff doesn't speak illy of your guests.",
