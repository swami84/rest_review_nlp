Just to warn other potential patrons who are seeking outdoor dining options during covid - the private chalet is neither private nor outdoors. We felt this was misleading and it seemed other patrons of the chalet felt the same as many were shocked when shown their table.  While the chalets are certainly quaint and cozy, they\u2019re essentially just walls on either side of the table but not in front of the table or closed off on the ceiling. Additionally the tables are inside the restaurant. Perhaps this situation would feel safer with a curtain or door on the front to more completely section off the table from the rest of the restaurant.  Additionally we were disappointed in our service. The server had no knowledge of the drink or wine menu and was unable to advise. Fortunately the manager was able to assist but would say it\u2019s the restaurant\u2019s job to train its staff. We also had to ask multiple times to have our table cleared in order to make space for upcoming dishes.  Wanted to love it, but left underwhelmed. The best part of the evening was the baked goods from their bakery.",

The service was just okay. Our CEO asked for a minor change to her plate, and the female server told her, \"no substitutions.\" Seriously? We paid to have the restaurant to ourselves for several hours, and you can't provide a different side dish? I asked a different male server for the SAME minor substitution, and he took care of it, so I know it was possible. Not a lot of attention to our group - no second round of bread, and I had to flag a server down for a soft drink. The food was tasty, but only came out luke warm, although that could have been because they were trying to serve 25 people at the same time. Final word: Good, but not great. Need to work on their service. I wasn't overly impressed, and there are so many other restaurants to try in D.C., I probably wouldn't go back.",

We had the Unlimited Raclette Experience,  along with some other appetizers (Brussels sprouts, smoked trout, Italian speck, and chicken liver pate). Honestly, nothing was outstanding. The pate was the best appetizer. All the others were either forgettable or disappointing. In terms of the raclette experience, I don't know if it's because we had such a large group, but it seemed to take forever for our vegetables to cook on the 2 cookers we had at our table (or maybe the server didn't adjust them to a hot enough setting). It made for a frustrating time, just waiting endlessly for the food to cook in front of you. Also, it was really just some potatoes, onions, and cheese on a little grill, so not that exciting or tasty. I wouldn't recommend the Raclette experience as meal, since there's essentially no protein, which is a huge negative, at least in my opinion.",

I love the decor in the restaurant it reminds me of being home of a farm. it has the look of a true stable. with historic wood and metal interior. Stable offers a number of swizzle dishes. my favorite would be the rachlette dinner, complete with everything you need from a grill to melt the delicious cheese. endless boiled new potatoes, marinated onions and pickled chalets. It is the best cheese that I have ever tasted. they have amazing drinks and the pricing is fair. I mean if you want great quality food, you gonna pay great quality prices. The chef David is a master in the kitchen and you can see for yourself. they have a wonderful kitchen bar seating area that allows you to watch David in his natural state! the General Manager Silvan is a work of art, he is so helpful and very caring about the up keeping of the place, all in all stable gets a 10 in my book! located right in the heart of DC on H street right across from H street country club and right next door from the Vet! stop in and have some amazing food!",

At the end of the meal we ventured to the back of the restaurant- we were shocked by the beautiful \"patio\" hiding in the far back. Gorgeous bar, high ceilings, beautiful decorations.  All and all- amazing experience. 10/10. We will be back again!!!",

By the time we left at noon, there was a healthy flow of people.  Here's what's to love about Stable:  1) Atmosphere: You're transported into Switzerland. The wooden decor, the bread baskets at the bar and the iron spiral staircase in the back dining room, creates atmosphere. The front room has a wall that lifts up in warmer weather giving diners a view of the historic Atlas Theater across the street.  2) Service: Perfect balance of attentive, friendly, and giving you your space to dine with friends.  3) Food: My Stable Casserole was perfect- creamy, balanced, and the fried egg cooked to perfection. My wife loved her cheese plate.  4) Drinks: For just $25, you can make your own mimosa. They bring a big bottle of champagne to your table with a jug of orange juice, and elderflower liquer. It was great!  If you need a solid brunch spot on H Street NE, go here!",

The food is impeccable- you can tell the care and TLC they put into each item in the menu. My only advice- location is mediocre...tough to find parking and the neighborhood can be seedy at times (I might be selfishly saying that as I would to love to have more great restaurants like this closer to MD- like chevy chase, glen echo, friendship heights area). I look forward to seeing this restaurant thrive for many years to come as DC grows and evolves.  I also look forward to Chef David continue pushing the envelope on finding amazing dishes from Switzerland and bringing them here each season and experimenting and innovating yummy food.  ps the chicken liver pate is the best in town.",

They take special care in the smallest of details such as folding napkins when you leave the table, helping you put on your coat when you leave, and a manager on site checking in to just be sure that you're enjoying your experience. Our waiter was extremely attentive to our needs and offered excellent recommendations. We went with the capuns, the French Riesling, the belper knolle fondue for two, and the panna cotta. I was honestly embarrassed when I took a bite of the capun and realized I was letting out an audible, \"mmmmm.\" Delicious. the Riesling was a great match for all of the dairy we ate. The fondue was delicious, and provided us with a longer experience, just soaking up the great vibes of this place - watching the chefs prepare dishes, listening in on the German and French conversations around us, and enjoying each other's company. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!",

We made reservations ahead of time and when we arrived we were seated immediately at a small but very cozy table.  Our waiter couldn't have been better, and was incredibly good at explaining the menu and checking in with us to see if we needed anything.  The food was delicious! I had the Branzino which was cooked perfectly (I was also debating getting the duck) and my girlfriend had the veal. We both had salads as appetizers, and enjoyed the fresh bread. For dessert we had the apple tart.  Everything was truly fantastic and we can't wait to go back again!",

I ate every bite and left nothing. We also had fondue and creme brulee which was incredible! I can't believe how much I enjoyed myself at a simple brunch.

They took very good care of us & we even had the pleasure of meeting the owners of this slice of heaven, Silvan & Chef David. The decor & set-up is beyond creative also! You're totally gonna wanna take plenty of pics. Thoroughly enjoyed brunch & just when I thought I couldn't possibly love them anymore....BAM!!!...Allison (our server) came and told us they had Creme Brulee for dessert! My fav! I will definitely be taking my family back to Stable DC! D\u00e9licieux!!!",

The hostess made a point of stating \"We are closing in one hour.\" I thought to myself...\"uhhh okay?\" I was a little confused as normally 5-30 minutes is the typical warning, and 30 minutes is stretching it... unless it's a three hour meal kind of place. I then request not to be seated where the draft hits as it was very cold on Saturday.  Guess what?  That's exactly where she decides to seat us.  My friend requested a seat in the back as we saw a room since the initial seating was subject to the draft of cold air from outside. So the hostess seats us at the empty bar. What made this worse was the looks we got from the chef and his sous chef or whatever he was.  IT WAS THE MOST UNWELCOME I HAVE EVER FELT IN A RESTAURANT.  If that was the chef he should be ashamed of himself for his lack of hospitality.  We felt like we were not wanted in the restaurant.  This kind of attitude is the problem in Washington DC restaurants.  When staff think they are too good to serve you and give you an attitude when their entire survival is based on MY MONEY.  Some nerve, I say.  After being received like dirty dish rags we said we were going to another place.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK IN THIS PLACE.  I didn't get to try the food, but if that's the attitude that comes with it, no thank you.  Try acting like that in New York City...you'd be closed in less than six months because no one would put up with that kind of treatment.",

        "caption": "Food was good but not really the most amazing Swiss food I have had. In my opinion it was over-priced for what it was. I spend a significant amount of time in Switzerland and didn't really feel anything in this restaurant.  There was way to many staff members for a week night and it felt like they were bored to death. As a result they were hovering a lot and asking every few minutes if all was good. It got annoying after a while. Some where absolutely clueless on the  food itself.  The place is nice but it just does not feel Swiss enough for me. You couldn't really tell from the outside that it was Swiss: that yellow mailbox with the Swiss flag will not be enough for most customers in the area to guess the theme.  Overall, I wish this place would be more Swiss in the decor and the food and really give me the experience I was expecting. I hope it works as it would be a great addition to H Street and grows into what it has the potential to be.",
