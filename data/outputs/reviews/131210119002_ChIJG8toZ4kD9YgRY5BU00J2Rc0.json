The manager came out of his office and started making disrespectful comments about if the dessert is free why would someone complain about it. He stated several other rude comments loud so I could hear since I was eating in the dining area. This is unprofessional and wasn\u2019t necessary. If a customer says that a dessert isn\u2019t that good at least take the criticism and let the person that\u2019s preparing the dessert so they can try to improve it. I won\u2019t be spending my money anytime soon here. The food is good and the price is reasonable but don\u2019t let a customer hear your comments because you can\u2019t take criticism. Oh well. I will spend my money else where where my opinion and feedback is taken serious.",

On my first visit, I stopped by to request a last-minute pineapple cake (9-inch) for a belated birthday gathering, and I was able to pick it up the very next day!  It was quite tasty, I'm guessing the icing was some sort of butter cream, but it wasn't overly-sweet, and there were pineapple bits inside of the cake as well.  The two gentlemen who assisted me (sorry, I didn't get their names) were nice and helpful as well.  I wish I'd thought to snap a photo of the cake to share with this review, I will be returning (I hope to try more sweet treats!)",

My turkey sausage was under cooked. My co workers waffle was brick hard. When I called to speak with them about the food They were very rude. The manager asked me \u201cWhat do I want him to do about it\u201d. Then rather rudely stated \u201cThe sausage is not cooked here. I will return the money to your card and hung up the phone. Great customer service and a Great manager would have offered me a free meal or even to recook the food we ordered. I will NEVER eat here again. Customer Service is everything.",

So crispy, the right amount of heat in the hot sauce, and a great amount of chicken on each wing. Also the service was superb- even held the door for me when I left. Great experience. Can't wait to go back.",
