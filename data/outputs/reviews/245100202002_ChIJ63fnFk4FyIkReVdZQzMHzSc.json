        "caption": "I got the \"Taco Pizza\" the first time I ordered from this place. I figured that this must be one of their signature dishes given they named it after the restaurant. The pizza was under cooked and I ended up with a mouth full of dough. I took it back to my house, put it in the oven on high for another 15 minutes to cook through and it still had a bland, doughy taste that only a third grader who has ever eaten frozen pizza could appreciate. Ok - so maybe pizza is not their specialty. I ordered their chicken over rice platter  a week later and I was met with a mouth full of stale, dried rice. I initially thought it was a chicken bone (which I would have much rather prefered).  I would highly recommend avoiding this establishment.",
