The goat cheese fondue is the greatest pairing I\u2019ve ever had and I came searching for a way to recreate it.  I\u2019ve visit Chicago at least once a year and this was my first time visiting Uncommon Ground. The patio was absolutely gorgeous, the service was so great  and the food was even better. This was also my husband\u2019s first trip to the city and this was his favorite spot we visited, he loved the beer (and his burger)! We can\u2019t wait to come back again!",

I have been regularly coming in (once or twice a month for over five years), and the staff has really gone down hill over the past year.  I have placed pickups orders and been told to come over in 20 minutes, and it really takes closer to an hour so you stand there waiting. While you wait, you would think they could get you your bill so you can pay and be on your way when the food arrives, but instead you wait to pay after your food arrives.  I have sat at the bar, with an empty water glass, an empty beer glass and an empty plate, waiting for the bartender to come back to me. Instead of refilling my water, asking if I wanted another beer (I did) or clearing my plate, the bartender and several other staff members were fawning over the owner of the Metro theater who was in as well.  It seems like they need new management or some servers who can avoid making simple mistakes (like ordering chilaquiles without chorizo and having them arrive with chorizo).",

In those times, the staff ranged from hippie to hipster, who liked to talk about philosophy between courses At it's worst, the high turnover of chefs and waitstaff produce an opening night vibe of lack of training and hospitality. That's where we are now.  Recently, a hostess told us we had one hour to eat, then failed to offer to take a drink order. Some of the staff implement the covid rules by sneaking up on the table, stomping their foot, like a Queen's grenadier guard punctuating his 12 foot march in front of the palace, and rolling their eyes to show the customer that it's an imposition on the server to wait two seconds while the customer fumbles with his mask.  Last night our waitress was rude, argumentative, and impatient. She literally threw things on the table, not in an assaultive way, but to make sure everybody knew she was in a bad mood, putting a pall over our evening. This isn't just an issue of an individual. We are regulars at a number of restaurants, and staff can't get away with acting like this. Twenty something servers  are not Red Guards on a mission to train their elders.  Although the front of the house is the main problem right now, it's worth mentioning that we could use an occasional interesting new appetizer, like the hippie egg rolls we had a few months ago. Helen's Chicken is fine, and the chili remains excellent, but the lack of anything new just reinforces the impression of an angry and unhappy zombie march through covid.",

I had an awful experience here tonight. I had been wanting to try Uncommon Ground for awhile now. I live in the neighborhood. My boyfriend and I got off work late and knew to call ahead to make sure when the kitchen closed, which was 10. We showed up at 9:15 pm full prepared to order right away. When the server came around after introducing himself, we were immediately ready to order. 2 beers, 1 app and 2 entrees. We waited and chatted. It got to be 10 pm. No beer has arrived. No water refills. No table visit, except to tell me that the side I ordered 40 minutes ago (mac n cheese) was out. Oh ok no problem. Can I have fries instead? Oh I\u2019m sorry our kitchen is closed ...(?) Then, why did you wait until 10 pm to tell me this? App arrives (sweet fries with goat cheese) **still no beer** then he comes back with our entrees. I ordered the black bean burger and my bf got a beef burger. Neither of us finished ( and we were hungry) Everything was dry and lacked flavor. It was like they made the worst meal on purpose. We got the check. And you know what? I paid in full. I know restaurants are suffering right now. I paid $50 for my mediocre appetizer and awful entrees. But I want the owner of this establishment to read this. The service and food I had tonight (after wanting to eat here for some time) was so disappointing that I wish I could get a refund. Please hire more attentive staff that care about their jobs. I was in the best mood, ready to enjoy my Friday. And this experience soured the whole evening.",

However, the person on the phone told me we would be accommodated.  However, when we arrived, we were turned away, regardless of this commitment.  While the talent booked is fine, the food is middle of the road, and the location inconvenient.  It's not enough to go back for.  We won't return.  UPDATE:  Only part of the he response below is correct - we were only told that we could wait to see if there were no shows - no offer of a drink on the house orvothers waiting.  When I spoke to the venue on the phone the day before, I was told we would be accommodated.  In addition, I had responded to a text that afternoon confirming our dinner reservation for the show, something not acknowledged.  While we appreciate the offer of complementary show tickets, it's unlikely we'll return.",

We sat at the bar and the poor guy behind the counter seemed super overwhelmed. Didn\u2019t get a menu for 5+ minutes after taking a seat. That and Lackluster food quality result in a downgraded review from 5* to 4*  2014 review: We came in here randomly after watching a performance at the Public House Theater down the street one frigid winter day & were immediately impressed by the decor and staff. We took a seat at the bar and struck up a conversation with the bar tender, Lee.  He's an impressive guy - does all their infusions & know SOOO much about beer. Very cool guy. He's remembered us in subsequent visits.  The food is tasty as well - we've mostly had the apps, not the entrees, but they do Cheese Curds really well. On top of that, they have a very impressive beer list and great space. Live music on the weekends in a room of the main section and a big seating area in the back.",

I'm giving 1 star though because of the service. I went with my girlfriend who is vegetarian and ordered a cauliflower dish. As she was eating, she found a piece of chicken in it (looked like it fell in from another dish). I (a meat eater) tasted it and confirmed. Not a big deal, it happens. She was disgusted and asked them if they could remake it. The waitress was very apologetic and took the chicken piece back. The manager came out a few minutes later and said he looked at the piece and it wasn't chicken, but overcooked cauliflower. That's why they're getting a one star rating. Don't try to lie to your customers. I eat chicken, I eat cauliflower, and overcooked cauliflower doesn't take on the texture and flavor of chicken (I'd be eating a lot more cauliflower if it did).  Side note, I had the burger. It was nothing special. For a much better (and cheaper) burger with way better service, head down one block to Mordecai's.",

If you don't like young adults with their own energy that translates into music of the contemporary jazz genre and infused with rap and poetry, stay home and watch reruns.

And food, yes food and drink that breaks the chain of common place wannabe  establishments then I invite you to treat yourself and friends to a good atmosphere of relaxation with respect to yourselves and enjoyments of music, food and drinks.

I love the concept of the restaurant and their support of sustainability and keeping a lot of their ingredients local.  Last night we went to celebrate our two-year anniversary there, partially because of the history we have with the restaurant, partially because a lot of restaurants are closed on Mondays and partially because we were planning last minute.  All I can say is that in general the food is very good \u2013 interesting, wide variety and range of price points.  The service though seems to get worse and worse every time we go.  Last night our service was subpar.  We let them know ahead of time it was a special occasion but no recognition of that from the host or server.  We were placed at a table where we could see the kitchen and clearly the staff just wanted to go home (we were a 7:45 pm reservation and not the last people there).  There was two different types of music playing at the same time \u2013 I think from the kitchen and then in the restaurant which was distracting and acoustically annoying.  The kitchen staff kept coming out to watch the game which is fine, except with the overall servers and host being nonchalant and not engaging about everything, it definitely came off the wrong way \u2013 as in \u201cPlease finish up your food so we can go home\u201d.  I want to continue to love uncommon ground but at this point I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be on my list for restaurants anymore.",

Ordered it medium and it came out rare and swimming in liquid.  When mentioning to the waiter that the taste was not pleasing, he went to the kitchen and came back with some aioli sauce!   In addition, our order of chilaquiles was dry and mainly chips; barely any eggs whatsoever.   Waiter immediately brought us our check as if he just wanted to get it over with;  never asked if we wanted more coffee or anything else.  $57 brunch for 2 = Sunday afternoon regret.

We ordered the brussels sprouts which are marked as a gluten-free option on the menu (in red letters) and after my wife started eating it he came over to tell us that they only use one fryer for everything....  which means it\u2019s far from gluten free.  I\u2019m grateful he told us, I\u2019m very disappointed that the kitchen could care less about people with food sensitivities by marking things GF and using one frier for everything...The bearded trendy server was so nonchalant about telling us...",

It was very loud in the bar and north room so we sat in the west room and that was quiet enough that my spouse and I could hear each other. We both ordered the root veggie hash with and egg and it was very good. The unicorn tears hot sauce was very nice. We had a Belgium waffle Sunday and also coffee. The bill was kind of up there for breakfast but we did this on a whim and chalk it up to experience and were very satisfied with the food. The server was very nice and professional and the food came fast and hot. The coffee was strong and  fresh and good, much better than most restaurant coffee. I recommend, however, it is not an inexpensive breakfast. I will say that the veggie and vegan options make the price almost worth it, but I can get relatively the same food at Pick Me Up Cafe for half the cost and I'm pretty sure Chicago Diner is also cheaper. This is very good, gourmet bar food, but you're not getting out for a bargain price if that's a factor.",

The good: The ambience of the entire restaurant is really cool, with a lot of artistic decorcations and lighting. The service was very friendly and attentive and helpful with the menu. The food is good, with appropriate portion sizes and fresh ingredients. Nice patio  The not-so-good: To be blunt, it's too expensive. The food was good but not great, and certainly didn't warrant the prices they had. My dad had two eggs, potatoes, and toast, and it was $15. That's absurd. The menu is interesting, but there aren't a ton of options on it.  Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 8/10 Food: 7/10",

I ordered the lemonade once I knew this was the farm to table kind of place. Let me just say i didn't disappoint!! It was definitely the perfect drink for a hot summer day in Chicago.  For food, I ordered the roasted red pepper sandwich. The portions are pretty generous here - so come really hungry or ready to pack the rest of your meal to go.  The quality of the ingredients were fresh and rich. I loved every bite of my food - although my plate probably said otherwise. My stomach got the best of me and I definitely hit my food coma faster than I thought. Probably shouldn't have drank all that lemonade.....The food was great and they offered a variety of local hot sauces to pack in a punch if you love some heat on your food like me.  The service was a little hit and miss. I found it rather slow at the beginning and felt like we were tucked away to a corner most of the time there. While it was nice to be by the bay window - it seemed like we were at a table on a lonely island. They did have patio seating, but nothing shaded which is why we opted to sit inside.  Overall cute breakfast spot and solid food options!",

I reserved a table for two, over the phone, over 24 hours in advance of the show. Was told, \"once you show up, the price of your ticket will be added to your bill\", cool, no problems.  The show \"started\" at 9, and I arrived at 9:17. If you've ever been to a live music show, starting on time never happens. My theory was accurate last night as well, as the show didn't start until 9:30....  This is where it gets fun. I was promptly told at the door that my reservation was given to someone else for being 17 min late. This gentleman's name was Kevin. Kevin said \"you can wait around to see if more spots open up.\"  A little annoyed, but understanding, I waited around to hopefully get a spot. I sat and watched as Kevin promptly sat patrons who were over 1 HOUR to 90 minutes late.  Apparently, their policy is \"make a reservation 24 hours in advance, if you don't show up exactly on time we give your spot away. BUT if you have a reservation and your full party isn't there, you can still show up an hour late and get right in.\" Makes sense.  I then politely asked the hostess (short curly blonde hair) about their reservation policy because it did not make much sense to me.  In an extremely condescending tone she said, \"being 20 minutes late is an industry standard, you should know that\". I stated I was disappointed I wouldn't get to see my friend play, and she replied (with obvious sarcasm) \"I'm so sorry\" and walked away.  I was pretty taken aback at the blatant rudeness and \"different rules for different people\" approach at this place. I'll never step foot in here again. Also, got the goat cheese/spinach artichoke dip and it looked and tasted like something you pick up in the frozen food section at Aldi. Save your money people.",

I moved and purchased a condo at the Lake and Diversey and for reasons I'm unsure of I stoped going here for several years. Probably due to so many places to choose from near my condo. Although, there isn't one or even two casual dining spots with quality food, outdoor seating and music that even come close to the urban chic, yet casual ambiance offered by UG on Clark. I dined at the restaurant on Devon a few times and also my mom loved the Devon location plus we grew up right down the street and my Mom and dad cooked often so they loved that UG has a herb and vegetable garden on their \"green\" roof.  I'd say I frequented Devon more often during my mom's illness 2007 to 2011 as she enjoyed it there. We had her wake right across the street and I recall after the wake - the last night friends and I dined here.  I sold the condo after 14.5 years and developed an illness in 2015 so when I could venture out I'd head back to UG on Grace. My dad often dined with me. The place expanded, appears slightly more upscale and has taken over 3-4 rooms total but the food is as good as ever.  I started having lunch with my dad at UG on Grace as I returned to health. We'd always wonder if my dad's favorite server, Savanah, is working. She and dad both grew up in or near Tera Haute Indiana-which has its own fan base I learned and dad and Savanah spoke about this town which I'm certain I'm spelling wrong for over 1/2 hour. We learned that Savanah is an actress and my dad rents to an acting teacher who teaches an acting method familiar to Savanah. She's quite keen on taking lessons.  We also learned that on many of the days we keep Savanah from doing her job because we all love chatting so much- that the Cub's owners and management also enjoy her and didn't say one word when we were talking to her too long and the Cub's staff had to leave. That's classy.  The owner often chats with us and is friendly, down to earth and takes much pride in his great food.  The food is always made fresh daily, with some menu staples but also fresh changes regularly.  I love the chopped salad with salmon, the sweet potato fries, Asian spicy grilled calamari and all the soups - tomato and the cheddar broccoli. Vegan chili is also fantastic. Breakfast is always good. A bit pricy but worth it!",

Assuming reasonable prices that should have totaled around $8 to $10 max, we were shocked at the $19 bill for two mediocre espresso drinks.  The Americano was around $3.50 or so - high but not unreasonable.  The 4 shot espresso latte was $15.50!!!  I complained to the manager who found the staff had overcharged but that espresso still came out to $10.50.  This was unquestionably the worst gouging I've experienced in 3 decades of ordering espresso drinks.  This place should get out of the espresso business until they educate themselves in the art and business of coffee.",

We went there for a friend and the music and atmosphere is good, but the food is aweful.  We had some drinks and 3 meals, which was 40ish bucks, fine with tipping for that. But the food was bad except for the fish tacos. But on top of that it's 10$ coverage for the music each person, THAT YOU HAVE TO TIP FOR. I have never heard of tipping the server for the musicians playing.  Over priced mediocre food served to college kids who don't really get that they're getting ripped off. 13$ for \"calamari\" without any squid, 12 for bad macaroni and cheese.

My friends arrived about 5 minutes after I did and it also took them forever to get their drinks.  We ordered breakfast at about 10:20 and it did not arrive until 10:50.  We weren't in a hurry, but it seems ridiculous given how slow it had been when we first arrived.  I had the Chilaquiles and my eggs were lukewarm, which basically meant they'd been sitting around while the other dishes were created.  The side potatoes were warm, crisp and tasty.  My friends ended up liking their egg sliders.  It ended up being ~$25 each.  We go out for breakfast once/month to a new place each time and there are plenty of good places.  So, considering the slow service and lukewarm food, I wasn't impressed, so won't be returning.",

They even managed to cook it rare, as ordered, more often than not. Last week I tried again - got a smaller burger, slightly overcooked, without tomato (not in season, locally)  and overcooked sweet potato fries (extra charge).  The bill with tip came to very bit of $20, with just tap water!   That's too much for a tomato-less, average-tasting  burger - no matter how organic and politically correct.  Let's get real!",

I am usually an omnivore and I prefer a chili that is light on the beans, but in spite of that it was flavorful, and slightly acidic with a nice bite of spice.  I also ended up enjoying the tomato sandwich.  It was a nice combination that used fresh heirloom tomatoes alongside fried green tomatoes.  The winner in the dish was the aoli that brought the dish together.  The only criticism I have is that it was a bit difficult to eat,  even with the giant toothpick holding things together, the layers of the  sandwich were slipping all over the place.  I don't mind that much because messy sandwiches are some of the best you can have.",
