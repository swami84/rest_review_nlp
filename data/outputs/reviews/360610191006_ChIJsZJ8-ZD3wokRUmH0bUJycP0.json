This is a different kind of pizza compared to a regular Neapolitan and I haven't found any other place in the city that is able to make it the same way. The crust is light and crunchy, making it so incredibly good! Five star all the way, from the dough to the quality of the ingredients. I also love they carry a rare beer imported from Italy which I also have never seen anywhere else. The place is super cute, with dimmed lights, beautiful decor and very cozy. It's a fantastic little gem!",
