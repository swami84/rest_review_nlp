First: there is hardly any parking at all and we had to walk a couple of blocks just to get there. Second: I dropped my very obviously 8-month pregnant wife off at the door so she could be seated with our reservation while I parked and ran back. I was shocked to discover that they absolutely refused to seat her until I was there. Making a super pregnant woman stand for no reason? Classy. Third: I discovered that they automatically add 10% to your bill as a service charge for the staff, yet still expect you to tip in addition. You want to provide a higher wage to the staff? That\u2019s fantastic and I support it. So add 10% to your prices. Don\u2019t pretend your food costs less than it really does. Fourth and to top it off: our food took over one hour to arrive. Honestly the more I think about it the angrier I get. It was just all around a terrible experience. The chicken was very good though, hence the extra star. I might try it again in six months to see if they figured things out but I\u2019m not holding my breath.",

The minty, anise flavor really compliments the richness of the fried chicken and ranch sauce. The cocktails are bold, but balanced. Try the soju! It\u2019s like vodka, but smoother and sweeter.  We also enjoyed the vibe. It\u2019s low key and funky. And our server was friendly and knowledgable. We are looking forward to trying more of the menu and having brunch on the back patio!",

The fried chicken was awesome too, and despite what other reviews state ours was super crispy- audibly crispy from other tables type of crispy which is typical for Korean fried chicken. The sauces were awesome too. 12 wings and tteokbokki were enough for us two and we took home some left overs.

The theme is Korea street food but expect to pay triple the amount of actual Korea street food. As someone who was born and raised in Korea, I feel that I have some credibility when reviewing the food (and price). I tried some of the hot wings, the kimchi fried rice and bulgogi. The food was flavourful  but not Korean. If you are looking for authentic Korean cuisine, Gangchu might not be for you. Expect a 10% service fee on top of the already expensive menu pricing. The service fees goes toward the employees, not the managers or business owners. This fee goes directly to the employees to provide them with a more livable wage. This is great! I just wish the business would build these fees into their menu prices and just pay their employees what they want? I'm not sure why they advertise the service fee. It all seemed a bit pretentious. I love that the Seminole Heights area is bringing in small, local restaurants. The SH area has really been anchored by their growing bars and restaurants. I'm just not sure how well the business will do with their surrounding neighborhoods. Most of the SH community is low income households. I think restaurants like Gangchu will have to rely on people coming from all over Tampa to try their food. I'm not sure how sustainable the prices will be in the long run.",

We knew they were on the mild side but neither had any real character, I especially thought the dry rub lacks a little kick. We will try something else next time. They were well prepared though and came out quickly. My other reason to knock a star off the rating is drink prices. $12 for a Single Makers Mark and $13 for Jack and Coke is just way too high. I'll check beer prices next time. I'm not sure about the automatic 10% service charge, I always tip at least 15% even for pretty poor service and usually much more so I just adjust to the 10% already being there and they don't hide it but it's an odd thing to do.",

I tried the Korean BBQ flavor and their Korean dry rub. The Korean BBQ wings were chewy and bland, and the dry rub wings were flavorless. The fries were soggy, starchy, and barely seasoned. I was looking forward to going to a dedicated Korean chicken restaurant in Tampa, but Gangchu was a let-down.

The bulgogi and kimch fried rice were ok not great but were severely over priced, $14 for a small portion of kimchi rice. The Korean side dishes or Banchan were very tiny like a small spoon ful in tiny sauce dishes and didn't taste anything like authentic side dishes why call it banchan if it doesn't taste anything like it. Service was fine, feels like a trendy type of place but for $85 I expected more. I don't mind over priced food if it was good. This was just ok. Food was very slow coming out too. I don't mind the 10% on top of bill, I understand that but again 2 beers 24wings small bulgogi and small kimchi fried rice seems high maybe good if someone hasn't had Korean food before.",

I arrived with my friend a few minutes before 5pm on a Saturday, the restaurant had opened only a few weeks ago. After waiting more than ten minutes to even be acknowledged, they said I would not be seated without a reservation. The hostess said no reservations were available until 9-9:30 pm. I could see that only 5 of the 12 inside tables were in use, and only one of the outside tables was in use. It seemed odd that a restaurant less than half full in the afternoon would turn away two paying customers over a reservation policy, after just opening in today's market. But worse, no other dining option was offered, not sit at the bar, or take out. During the time I waited before being turned away, another employee was at the host station, leaning against the wall and talking on the phone, but never looked up or acknowledged me. Two other employees stood behind the station talking, also never smiled a greeting or made eye contact. Such an unfriendly place.",

The atmosphere is a welcomed addition to Seminole Heights, bringing the right energy and decor to make you feel like you\u2019re really being immersed in the concept.  Korean BBQ Fried Chicken Wings are something that I seek at other restaurants, and i'm happy I finally found my go-to spot for satisfying that craving!  Next up was the Bulgogi Beef Plate - impressive portion size! Banchan was a great compliment, my favorite is the bean sprouts - they\u2019re delicious.  Drinks from the bar were delicious and served quick - i\u2019m excited to come back with some friends and see how many beer towers we can put back!!  I will say that i\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t get the Crispy Fried Chicken, I saw it come out of the kitchen, and knew that it would probably be my favorite thing on the menu but had to wait till next time because we already ordered.  Overall, GREAT job and incredible service - its clear they\u2019ve done a great job training the team to be knowledgable about the menu, concept, and beverages. The staff was following all guidelines and recommendations to make customers feel welcome AND safe in the restaurant.  To the comments from the first few days on running out of small items - it\u2019s a brand new concept that opened during a pandemic \u2014 relax, and applaud them for a monumental accomplishment. Gangchu has my vote!",

Happy hour from 4-6 gets you $2 off any beer, wine or craft cocktails. Another great addition to Seminole Heights!",

Any thing besides the chicken was terribly overpriced and the quality was sorely lacking.  For example I got Kim Chi on the side for $1.50 and it was given to me in a small sauce jar... basically 2 or 3 bites.",

Once we got situated we ordered and told us that they don't have any more wings. You are called Gangchu CHICKEN and beer! How the hell are you already out of chicken and are open till 11? I was really excited about this place but on first impression that it gave me was nothing but disappointment!",

Their Korean-style chicken was very crispy and had plenty of great sweet and spicy sauces to toss the chicken in or use for dipping. They also had lots of interesting cocktails that were local-inspired along with a full bar.  The restaurant had a fun, dynamic atmosphere that could range from a relaxed, sit-down eating experience to a fun, social vibe by grabbing wings and a drink at the bar. Parking is scarce so be prepared to street park.",
