Do you want me to pay for it OUT OF MY OWN POCKET?!!!\u201d Huh? I know it\u2019s hard to be in the service industry, now more than ever, but you made a mistake - just send over my missing food that I paid for or refund it or something and it\u2019s all good.

The ambiance is so cute with nice lighting and great greek music. We ate at the bar, but there was a good amount of seating. It was surprisingly full for a Tuesday night! (good sign) The menu had an appropriate amount of options, including some vegetarian-friendly ones. Grape leaves were the bomb dot com. I loved the Chicken Bifteki, which was essentially a chicken burger patty served with salad, tzatziki, fries, and warm pita. The burger had really nice grill marks on it and almost tasted like it was cooked on a wood fire. My partner got the halloumi platter which was served with essentially the same things but had cheese in lieu of the chicken patty. It was also delicious. To end it all, we had baklava. It was perfectly sweetened, great layering, and just the right amount of rosewater so it didn't overwhelm or overpower. Despite all the options this area of Brooklyn has to offer, we will definitely come back and eat here again.",
