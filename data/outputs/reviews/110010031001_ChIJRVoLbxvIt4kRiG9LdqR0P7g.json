There is never any patties or oxtails or if they don\u2019t have an item, instead of calling the customer to let them know, they substitute the item missing for something I didn\u2019t ask for. I have tried to bear with them, but it seems to be happening way too much. I had to unmark it as a favorite.

I placed the order online which gave me a specific time. And they didnt even bother to let me know we need to make more oxtail. Would you like to wait or to replace it. I'm not even going to bother to try again. And they were rude over the phone, hung up on me, and then proceeded to try and tell me a bs time for when I could expect my food. Then they went ahead and cancelled my order. If I had not called I would not of known until grubhub sent me a notification. Ugh, disgusted in poor customer service.",

I called  immediately after and the lady took down my name and number and somebody would call me back. when the food arrived I only got ONE order which was fine cause that's all I wanted but since two orders was not delivered I expected to be refunded my money. I called again and the lady said the manager would call me .....NOBODY CALLED ME!!!!! So now I have to do a debit dispute through my bank. Such a horrible first experience. Never again!!!",
