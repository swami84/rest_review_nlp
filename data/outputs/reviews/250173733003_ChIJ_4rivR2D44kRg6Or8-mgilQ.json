So they are a little slow in the order process from placing online and picking up. The order online says it's ready but when you get there sometimes there's a wait. Okay so about the food. My recent order I place was chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice. The rice and veggies were good. Now the chicken was strange as heck. I'm guessing they use chicken thighs. So I know some parts are dark meat right. But let me tell you I had dark brown nearly black/grayish looking meat in my bowl. Can someone please explain this? It was also very chewy. I almost threw up my food when I saw those pieces of chicken mixed in. My husband loves this place and says just don't order the chicken anymore only shrimp bowl, but I'm done with this place. So sad because I've been a loyal customer. Order at least twice a week.",

Please pay better attention to orders that you receive because the quality and flavor is not the issue. It would be a shame to lose business over small mistakes that could easily be avoided if better attention was being paid to orders.",

He said: \u201cdon\u2019t rate by exterior or interior, just try their \u201cchicken teriyaki\u201d. I\u2019ve tried and...I\u2019ve marked this place as my favorite for to-go food. A bowl was: 1. Deep - there were a lot of food. And not only rice, how it is usually. There were so much chicken that I thought it\u2019s only a chicken without any rice; 2. Healthy - instead of rice there were vegetables such as broccoli, carrot, onion and something else. Not a lot, but enough to enjoy it. 3. Tasty - the most important point. I\u2019m a big fan of teriyaki spice thus I know what I\u2019m talking about. My favorite is Salmon Teriyaki, but they don\u2019t have it, unfortunately. I hope they will add it into the menu.  Thus, in conclusion, this is a great place with affordable price and great food.  The only thing, I didn\u2019t find a parking, I\u2019ve stopped just in the curb. But it\u2019s not a big deal.",
