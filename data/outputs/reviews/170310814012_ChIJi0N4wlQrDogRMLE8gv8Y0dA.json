(If you were a fan of Broken Shaker food, back to when it first opened, then you definitely need to visit this place). Last night was my second time going there and it was still as good as my first time there! The hummus is perfectly seasoned, come with crispy chickpeas and the flat bread is crunchy on the side while warm and soft in the middle and sprinkled with sea salt. The pasta (my favorite dish) was also a delight and cooked in an gin essence sauce (I believe) with cherry tomatoes, parmesan and another cheese I can\u2019t currently recall \ud83d\ude05. My boyfriend got the gnocchi and it was really good too. I wish I had taken a photo of the first time we ate there because he got the lamb and it was such a fire dish!!! Will definitely be back because I have my eye on the monkey bread with smoked tomato sauce and caramelized mozzarella (I MEAN, COME ON!!!). Other than that, the service was good both time we were there with a tiny emphasis on last night as we sat outside rather than at the bar and had an actual waiter. It is a nice and quiet place and has a beautiful decor. We will definitely be back!",

        "caption": "Would give it less than 1 star but that was not an option. When I first arrived I asked a waiter if we seated our selves or did we have to wait to be seated(no signage.) I was told I needed to talk to someone to be seated and waved off on a general location. I went inside and asked to other people  before someone directed me to the hostess station. It was tucked around the wall and not obviously seen from the door. Finally seated and our order was taken. 45 minutes passed no food. Flagged down a busboy (hadn't seen a waiter since he took our order) and asked him to check on our order. 15 minutes later no food, no explanation, no waiter. I then noticed other tables being served that arrived much later than us! Finally a waiter showed up, and apologized. The kitchen was backed up. (They weren't backed up for the other tables) when the food finally arrived it did taste good but was not cooked as ordered. Runny yolks, when requested hard. If the restaurant had been packed mistakes would have been understandable. The poor service made it understandable why it was not packed. Very disappointed",
