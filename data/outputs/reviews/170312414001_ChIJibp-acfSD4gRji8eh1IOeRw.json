I was looking for somewhere to enjoy a treat, relax and read. This seemed like the perfect place. It\u2019s very cozy and fun looking inside.The energy was so off in the place, it had a very dead vibe. I ignored it and went right up to the counter to order and started talking to the guy working. I came very excited and cheerful and sweet, and he was just blah. I asked how long they had been here, and he said he honestly didn\u2019t know. Ok, he may have been new, but I don\u2019t think that was  the case, but I may be wrong. He answered with no personality or tried to engage in conversation. He asked me what I wanted, and I said I would please like the Matcha chocolate strawberry thing, he said what? Like he had no idea so I repeated it and used cone this time instead of thing. It\u2019s the only item with those ingredients so Maybe he\u2019s new or just didn\u2019t hear me, but I don\u2019t think that was it. So then asked me if I wanted anything else, I said no thank you. Paid, and that was it. No personality or customer service at all. Didn\u2019t tell me it would be ready in a few minutes, nothing at all. I had also mentioned it was my first time there and just got nothing from this person. So I waited and tried finding a spot. I felt like I waited forever, and I was the only one in there who had ordered, it was slow. So I finally get it by it being called out, and this woman also had no personality. Very dead energy and very weird vibes. There was also a back room, I had found and wanted to look at. A guy was standing in the there, and I had been polite asking if this space was opened. He said no unless you\u2019re with the private party. I said o no, I was just looking around it\u2019s my first time here. This room looks awesome, may I peak really quick, and he said yes, but his vibe was off and he said ugh, I just washed the floors. I could see that, and understand there was a private event happening soon, so I was trying to be respectful and understanding, I literally took 3 small steps from where I was already standing and he freaked out, even after saying I could. Thought it was so odd and off putting. So, I sit down to eat my treat and this is definitely the MAJOR REASON FOR THIS REVIEW. Thankfully I am not allergic to nuts, but this is a SERIOUS ISSUE! So as I stated I ordered the Matcha Chocolate Strawberry rice cone. No where in the list of ingredients did it mention almond slices. So I was very shocked to bite into my treat and get pieces of almond. Which I personally didn\u2019t care for being mixed in with the flavors. I didn\u2019t like them, but most importantly I was unaware of them. The person didn\u2019t ask me if I have a nut allergy or mention it was part of that item, and the menu didn\u2019t specify that either. So please fix that because if I was allergic to nuts, that would\u2019ve been bad. Also, for the $ amount of the item ,l the strawberries  were sliced so thin, and not many of them, you didn\u2019t get to really taste them, and you basically are left with the rice cone mostly. So more strawberries & thicker would perfect the treat. Lastly, I got there just before 7pm, they say they close at 8pm. I got my treat at 7:04 pm and basically right after I received me treat, they yell out they were closing. I double checked the time and it had an hour left. That was disappointing. I stayed and ate my treat and there were others inside as well still. No thanks for coming on the way out Overall, the experience was awful for my first time there. This is a long review, but I have spent 18 years in the service industry, and have loved every moment of what I do. Customer service is a top priority, it is a reflection of your business and what makes or breaks a place. So that\u2019s heavily disappointing especially because the place is so well done design wise. The menu discrepancy is HUGELY IMPORTANT. I truly mean this review with the best intentions to help make aware of things that could be improved to help your business. \u2764\ufe0f",

I went back and forth about 5 times. I know it was forgotten because I went over and the staff believed there were no more orders. Maybe a lost ticket. Didn\u2019t bother me too much. Someone tried to give me a banana for it, nice, maybe if you are to offer at all, allow to give coffee instead next time ( I\u2019m not assuming this is a customer facing issue) Then I went back a few times for for some tea lattes. No issue. Then, one day, I come back for two sandwhiches. A swarm of people were there that came in after us.  The two women in front of us took really long to order, adding little things here and there, changing their minds, didn\u2019t know what they wanted. Maybe the front register person can usher them along or let them know they can look and come back immediately after they make up their minds or Maybe have 1 person come quickly to take the next peoples orders. Those customers took a very long time, as if they were talking from a stream of consciousness with no awareness of environment, not exaggerating. Anyway, this isn\u2019t to judge them but just to point out that customer ordering with no bru control caused a backup, in my opinion. After that, the sandwhiches took a long time and a side of fruit was forgotten, Not a big deal but I could tell there are some issues with the flow of things. Maybe 1 person short in the kitchen. Bru needs to streamline things and keep them at a healthy, fast pace when the customers are coming. I don\u2019t think this is about individual workers, I think it\u2019s a system thing. Like maybe 1 more person to float around and help with random things... make coffee, pack that bag, give me the bread, refill the such and such. The people who work here are very very nice and need to convey to customers a sense of order. Otherwise, customers will harass them. I waited around for my sandwhich in front of the coffee makers for about 10 minutes after sitting and waiting for a while 1) other customers don\u2019t need to be exposed to that conflict 2) poor workers.  just  needs to go faster. Maybe too many options? Honestly, I like it and the space is so big, many people just come and want everything. Help everyone out and streamline things so the kitchen moves faster. Again, not the workers, just the process.",

I was delighted to see they had an extensive menu of smoothies and fresh pressed juices, along with coffee and some food items. I went twice during my trip and both times ordered the flat iron juice (tons of greens) and added CBD for an up-charge. The second time I also ordered an egg sandwich on a croissant with pesto and turkey, and unfortunately that left little to de desired which is the only reason why I\u2019ve deducted a star. The turkey was cold and rubbery and the egg was also cold and overall just not good. The atmosphere is lovely, tons of places to relax and get some work done or catch up with a friend. The juice was delicious and coffees looked good too. I would definitely recommend trying Bru if you\u2019re in the area!",

Staff is quiet and efficient but the raw juices here are sort of hot or miss because not all the servers here are the best at juicing the best tasting juices.  I know they serve sandwiches, smoothies and salads here too including outstanding chocolate chip muffins.

Upon walking in, there were posters on the floor. The common areas needed a sweeping and a wipe down. The bathroom floor was messy, there was no paper towel and the air dryer was broken (barely blowing warm air) thus I had to dry my hands on my clothes. We ordered two iced coffees and they were only able to make us one before they ran out. It was 4pm. We also ordered a turkey club and it was actually really good and healthy. The side was a bag of chips and it took the employees ten minutes to bring the chips to us after we got our sandwich. I did enjoy the comfy furniture and the many electric outlets. Seems like a good alternative to study or write in a crowded Wicker Park neighborhood. I plan on visiting again in the near future though if I have another subpar experience I will probably never come back.",

They told us they couldn't make either drink because they had removed their espresso machine as they were getting ready to demo the bar (yes, while the shop was open).  A worker even laid a construction tarp over the top of our open cups while we waited for the drinks to prep.  We settled on a drip coffee and a brewed tea as that's all they could offer us.  Next, it's time to pay.  I see they have a $5 minimum on credit cards...no big deal, our drinks rang up to about $8.  I hand the cashier my card and he awkwardly asks me to use cash.  I point out that I've exceeded their posted minimum but it did't seem to make a difference.  Fine, you've now thoroughly guilted me, cash.  Get our drinks and sit down to talk business.  Not two minutes later out come the circular saws and hammers! (no joke)  Every few minutes or so we had to put the brakes on our conversation  while we waited for the sawing and hammering to subside.  There are plenty of places within a blocks walk to get a cup of joe.  Don't waste your money here.",

So imagine my surprise when I get an email from them , asking whether I would recommend them or not, that indicated that they had an almost 5 star rating based on 90 reviews! I clicked \"no, thanks\", and was whisked off to a page asking how they could improve their experience. Just out of curiosity I tried \"yes\" on the email as well, and was brought to Google Reviews. Sneaky. So, keep in mind that you're getting a very selectively chosen subset of opinions on this place. Take a look at other review sites (assuming the same tactics aren't being used to enhance ratings there too) before you choose this establishment.",
