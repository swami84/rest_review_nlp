After 10 minutes, I hung up and called again. Was not able to get through. Now restaurant is closed for night. Have called numbers repeatedly since and not getting anyone. Obviously food is not on its way and Corthaiyou had no intention of ever delivering it. Hopefully I am able to get a refund, but if not will have to file a complaint with credit card. If you aren't able to provide service, thats fine, but admit it, don't offer it. Shame on Corthaiyou. Now I'm going to go rage make myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dinner.",

They have all of the right foods and good flavors, but it seems like there is always something slightly wrong with an item. The thai iced tea was way too sweet. The beef in the khao soi was overcooked and therefore chewy like rubber and the khao soi sauce itself was too salty and too sour. The pad see ew was fine though, but it wasn't something that makes you want to keep eating. In my opinion, CorTHAIyou is on it's way to becoming a 5 star restaurant. They just need to pay more attention to the details in the cooking. Side note: Whoever is doing or did the decor is amazing though \u2014 the place looks gorgeous. Maybe they should be the ones in charge of the cooking details as well. They have great taste!",

All their food is authentic and super delicious There's only one thing that they can improve - their somtam. They make it using some unusual recipe, which results in saggy green papaya strings that are soaked in some overpowering sauce. But besides that one dish (that\u2019s 3 out of 5) everything else is aroi mak mak! Definitely recommend this place for authentic Thai cuisine.",

The first time I came here I had the Chicken Satay as my appetizer and the Red Snapper as my main. Both were full of flavor and my snapper had the right amount of heat. I really enjoyed the Thai Iced Tea as well. The next time I dined here I got the Vegetable Spring Rolls as my appetizer and the Pad Kee Mow \"Drunken Noodles\" as my main. When I was done I wanted to lick the plate it was so delicious. This restaurant can really give Thai Farm Kitchen a run for its money. Will definitely come back to this amazing place.",

I forced my partner to not complain because I was so hungry I just wanted to power through, hoping the other dishes would deliver. We came here on opening and I enjoyed myself so was hopeful. Our second appetizer, the sausages, didn't come out until we got our entr\u00e9e -  texture was off and I couldnt handle more than a bite. Prik Khing was also lack luster in the flavor department, overall just tasted watered down.  I'm sad that their food is taking up space in my belly, especially knowing how much truly amazing food exists within walking distance. I mean cool, they have a vegan menu but I would hope you don't need to compromise on the flavor of other non-vegan dishes to cater to multiple audiences. On the service and general d\u00e9cor front - There was a man that I assume works there walking around in sweat pants, seemingly distracting the staff from attending to customers. And the actual seating and space a mess with odds and ends - eg half full polar water in a display shelf?  I could go on but think this is enough to prove myself as a true customer since the owner questioned the validity of my initial post. Save yourself a little disappointment and hit up Mondayoff down the block instead.",

This is the worst Thai food I have had in Brooklyn  After your response accusing me of not being a \"real customer\" because I didn't mention any specifics and recommended a far superior Thai restaurant in the neighborhood -  Specifics - Fried Calamari was barely breaded and extremely greasy because you didn't fry it at the proper temperature, leaving far from crispy, greasy and chewy calamari. - You brought the second appetizer we ordered (way after we finished our horrible calamari) with our main course, both were extremely boring and flavorless, especially Pad Prik Khing which tasted watered down. - Dont know whats up with your music situation, same song was playing over and over, cutting out for large gaps of time, repeating again, rather annoying. - I mentioned Mondayoff because their food is way better, service more attentive  and they seem to actually take pride in their product. It is clearly a better choice in the neighborhood and we wish we went there as we usually do, but the fact that it was raining out made us duck into you restaurant since it was closer",

I was craving some really good Thai food and I\u2019ve been to a couple of places where I didn\u2019t like the Tom Yum soup or Pad Thai at all but I love this gem of a place.  Me and my boyfriend usually visit on Saturday/Sunday\u2019s and the place wasn\u2019t packed at all. You have the choice of sitting inside or outside which is fantastic and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant just transports you to Thailand.  The food was a bit on the sweeter side but I\u2019m Indian so my spice levels are kind of high. I\u2019ve tried both the Tom yum and Tom kha soups and both are fantastic although if you want a spicer one you should choose the Tom yum.  Noodles, rice and mains they have a wide variety and their starters are pretty delicious too. We had a special crab Rangoon which has a cream cheese filling inside and it was perfectly paired with some sweet chilli sauce. Don\u2019t miss out on this place if you\u2019re in the neighborhood for some really good Thai food!",

So I went on to the Uber Eats application in search of a restaurant with great rice. I ordered the Khao Pad with shrimp and a order of Chicken Satay which came up to 24.50 plus the delivery tax. When the food arrived it was still hot,  but the meat wasn't sweating and soggy. The Khao Pad is fried rice with onions, scallions, carrots shaped like a sun and tomatoes which were prepared with jumbo shrimp.  Side note the shrimp was completely clean and split down the middle so it was cooked thoroughly. All in all the rice was perfectly seasoned and had a great taste, which is the reason why I ate the whole container in one sit in. Moving on to the Chicken Satay which is also known as grilled chicken on skewers. The chicken was well seasoned and tasted pretty simple even though it had a yellow tint as if it had been cooked in curry sauce. The Chicken was served with raw lettuce and shredded carrots along with two dipping sauces. One of the dipping sauces tastes like peanut juice with a hint of pepper, but it had the consistency of peanut butter mixed with oil. The second sauce looks like water with cut up vegetables in it, and it tasted like sweet vinegar . I didn't use either sauce on my food but I was very pleased with my meal and I feel like my money was well spent.",

The baby back ribs in garlic sauce were cooked well but completely devoid of seasoning. The small container with sauce offered a reprieve from blandness, but with nary a hint of garlic. 5. Grilled porgy in banana leafs... sticky, covered with very hard to remove, inedible skin (scales not removed) and bland asf. The dish smelled like the leafs, but tasted like nothing. Definitely avoid this \"special\".  Sadly the common theme here is lack of seasoning and flavor, which is really sad for Thai cuisine. 2.5 stars",
