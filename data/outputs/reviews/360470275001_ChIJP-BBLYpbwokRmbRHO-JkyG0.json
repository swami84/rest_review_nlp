Will call tomorrow about a new order and then will be back to adjust the review a final time based on what I assume (based on the many great reviews) will be a successful delivery experience. 3/5.  Original: Delivery was 5 minutes early but don't order delivery. I received the wrong pizza, a plain margarita, when I'd actually ordered the buffalo mozzarella one and paid an extra $2 for arugula that was of course missing cause it was the wrong pizza. Would never reorder delivery from here again. Disappointing. 1/5.",

Mike the owner is fabulous, always remembers his customers and we love sitting at the bar and chatting with him. I hope people actually get to go there to experience it after all these strange times are over.  Also, before you review that the pizza arrived cold..maybe you should blame the delivery vs the place that makes it? I encourage you to try to sit there, get the real experience, try the pizza out of the oven, and then leave a review. It would be the fair thing to do, don\u2019t you think?!",

He had the pepperoni it was nice and thin. The mozzarella again was fresh. My sister has the margarita pizza with extra basil, was very good and was not overly saucy.

Above all, Bravi has a root and commitment to its community, demonstrated in children's programs and arts events, such as its recurring jazz night that supports local musicians. BedStuy's best kept secret, if you ask me. Faves are the He Got Game and\u2014hey\u2014 just the plain Pepperoni. Husband goes with the classic Margherita.",

We were there with a little kid, and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. At the end of the meal, we had a few slices left that we were going to pack up, but by a freak accident they wound up on the floor. Our waiter replaced the pizza for us, even though we insisted that it wasn't a big deal. These guys are honestly great, and it's a local business I'm happy to support. I highly recommend the Diavola; the spicy soppressata is *chef's finger kiss*",

They were legitimately liquid and one of them wasn't even cut! I am still struggling to understand how a completely undercooked, tortilla crust, vomit soup, cesspool of a pizza makes it to a customer's door. Seriously concerned. I plan on going into this place in person out of genuine bewilderment and curiosity. I NEED to see the pizza being made. I NEED to see how on Earth something as simple as a pizza can be made so improperly. I'm a 22 year old guy, my standard for quality food at 11pm, let alone pizza, isn't very high, I wasn't expecting a gourmet pie, but dear god.... Dear God..... I have never seen a worse pizza in my life. I wish I could figure out how to add photos to reviews because oh lord....",

Toward the end of my meal, the server (who was lovely) showed me the expanded menu which included a number of new pizzas... mostly named after rap songs from artists who have some association with Bedford-Stuyvesant.  I don't know the owner, but my understanding is that he's from Naples.  And unless he's a huge fan of Biggie and Jay-Z (if so, then why not have those pizza names on the menus of the other restaurant locations??), then this choice feels like an uncomfortable mix of cultural appropriation, pandering, and condescension.  Perhaps it's an attempt to connect with the history of a neighborhood, but it is, at best, misguided and, at worst, offensive.  I strongly recommend changing these names.  I will probably come back here: as I said, the pizza is GOOD, and I live literally around the corner but... this bothered me.  Enough to write my first review ever of any restaurant--not in an effort to hurt this place, which I hope does really well, but to communicate what I believe to be an earnest marketing mistake.",
