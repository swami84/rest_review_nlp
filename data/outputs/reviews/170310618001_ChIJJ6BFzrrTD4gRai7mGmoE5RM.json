        "caption": "Tasty Asian has quickly become my favorite Chinese place in the area. They're open late and the first time I visited, a friend and I went in on a whim while after attending a play nearby. The seating area is rather small and a bit dimly lit but service was good. Is this the most authentic Chinese in Lakeview, no. But if you love a good American style Chinese restaurant, this place is more than solid and dang tasty. Being open late, I imagine it's a great stop after a night out at one of the bars in the area but I find myself craving their food all the time! I've ordered delivery a bunch as well. (They're paired up with GrubHub and Seamless though unfortunately not on UberEats). Delivery orders have always been accurate, well packaged, and nice and hot even though I'm at the southern most end of East Lakeview.  I highly recommend the Crab Rangoon. It may seem a bit pricey compared to some places but the serving size and the size of the actual Rangoons is HUGE! They have an amazing blend onion, imitation crab and cream cheese too. By far the best I've ever ordered anywhere. The onion in them really adds something to the flavor. I also love the orange chicken- again, a nice large portion size, and a bit spicier than some places. The chicken is nice and tender and you get plenty of sauce- so much so, be careful when transporting leftovers. I must not have snapped the lid down fully and had a mess of sauce in the bag, but when I warmed up the leftovers the next day, they we're still just as delicious. And I've never had an issue with leaky delivery, so the fault there was all mine.  My friend loved his meal as well and it's become a favorite for him too. I unfortunately don't remember what entree he ordered but I do remember enjoying the couple bits I had of his and the egg rolls he also ordered we're good though not vegetarian like some places (definitely had pork in them, a meat I typically avoid for religious purposes but heck, still a good egg roll and since I wasn't the one who ordered them, probably my own fault for not reading the menu). The only thing I could possibly fault this restaurunt for I that they don't offer tap water, only bottled but they're far from alone there. Pop also comes in a can if you're dining in, so no questionable fountain drinks but also no free refills, but low priced so my friend did not mind ordering a second can.  All and all, Tasty Asian has become a go to spot for Chinese and ranks high on my list for delivery. Big portions sizes, food is always tasty and hot. If you want super authentic Chinese, probably look elsewhere but if a solid American style Chinese restaurant is what you're craving, you can't go wrong here. Hands down, one of the best late night spots in East Lakeview/Wrigleyville too.",

It took two days before I felt well enough to sit at the computer to come back and revise it to include Part Two.  I see from other online reviewers I'm not the only one this happened to at this restaurant. I have been sickened on bad food a few times, but I rank this among the absolute worst episodes I've ever encountered. I had extreme nausea all night. I was finally able to heave everything up the next morning -- quite a relief. But I am still out of sorts more than 48 hours later.  You folks had better take a serious look at your kitchen area and cooking staff. ------------------- PART ONE  This fairly new little place is clean, with a polite and friendly staff, and the service was very fast. But as for the food, about the best I can say is that it was a tad better than going hungry.  My take-out consisted of two egg rolls (none included with any entree that I could find on the menu), and an order of General Tso chicken, which came to just a few pennies shy of 15 bucks. I live exactly three blocks from the place, and this happens to be a cold winter night. But even so, I can't imagine the egg rolls getting so stone-cold so fast. They had to go into the micro first thing. Unfortunately, that didn't help much. I ate about two-thirds of the first one, and tossed the rest. Sub-par egg roll. Grade \"D.\"  As for the chicken dish, I'd give it a grade of \"just adequate, but no more -- C-minus.\" Although a few of the pieces were fatty, most of it was lean; it was reasonably hot temperature-wise; and the breading was fresh/not soggy, compared to what you usually get with a carry-out of any breaded dish. But it may as well have been made with fast-food \"chicken tenders.\"  There was nothing in the way of the usual Chinese spices to give it any zip. Boring and bland. I dished up about half of the boxed portion over rice, and \"cleaned my plate\" of that much, but I tossed out the remaining half.  That sounds like a comment in itself, but I'm not trying to say it was terrible -- just that going back for seconds held absolutely no appeal. And warming it up as next-day left-overs? Forget it.  If you can imagine McDonald's putting Chinese food on their menu, that about describes it: I basically had a General Tso Quarter Pounder.  For what I paid, I'd call this pretty disappointing.",
