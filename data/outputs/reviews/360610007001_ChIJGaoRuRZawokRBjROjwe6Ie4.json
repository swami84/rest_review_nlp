Little too big, 5-10 flies kept hovering over us, landing on plates. Spent the evening making sure I didn't eat one by accident. Server offered me another drink when he saw the fly just sitting on my straw. See picture for flies sitting in our finished plates.

Worth the money though.  This is an update to the prior review I posted nine months ago: I come here somewhat regularly and the food and service has always been consistently excellent. From the charming way you are greeted on the phone when making a reservations to the attentive service and most importantly, the food, I have thoroughly enjoyed every visit. The porterhouse is the equal of peter luger, the massive filet mignon exceptional and the scallops are wonderful. I sometimes hope this trio of dishes was not so good so I would feel compelled to get something else from the menu but I and my table companions cannot ever from our favorites. Very welcoming staff and over all a rather beautiful interior. I write very few reviews but after several visits I felt this place deserved one.",

PS, no cars are allowed in the area. When I asked him for directions, he happily pointed me in the right direction but warned be it \"wasn't  very good\". First off, the service for our large party of 20, was abysmal. It took over 45 minutes to serve us. The first ones served were finished eating, before the last were served. This was probablyy because they only assigned one waiter to handle our entire table. They brought us out warm plates for the steak but by the time the steak came, the plates were cold.  The last two served, received the following comment from the waiter \"you asked for medium well, it takes longer to cook\". Yeah, but not 45 minutes. As far as the food, slightly below what you would expect from a top NYC steakhouse. The Porterhouse was cooked perfectly but a little short on flavor. The creamed spinach wasn't creamed. The sweet potato fries were excellent, however, the couple sitting next to us were eating regular fries and complaining about how salty they were. I would say all in all, a solid 3, maybe 3.5.",

I also specified allergies and that was not acknowledged as well. Two people arrived first and was initially sat down and the waitress quickly removed the other two place setting. We received two menus for four people and had to ask for more menus (after she visited the table several times). Two people ordered the Argentinean skirt steak($37) with the chimmicuri (?) sauce and two people got the Filet minion($48+). Nothing was cooked to the right temperature, as it was severely undercooked. The steaks do not come with a side so we had to order that separately and that was $10-12ea. It was served at room temperature. We went through the wine list and ordered several bottles that were no longer available. The steaks were tender and seasoned well and the wine we received was decent(Flora Springs Merlot 2016). It would have been lovely if there was a decanter and had a chance to breath. After our meal we were not offered any dessert or after dinner drinks so we opted to leave. Our bill was $391. We had a Siberian waitress who was pleasant at the table but overall some things were still lacking from this restaurant. Would I recommend it? No. We used the groupon special and it still was not worth it.",

The bread on the table was warm and delicious and the service was good too. They made the drinks strong at the bar and had a selection of about 10 beers. I know it's a chain so I was hesitant in some ways, but it seems like they have found a good formula to keep each location unique, but consistent in quality.",

Not a big deal, but a place that caters to a good amount of older gentlemen and lawyers certainly should not be so neglectful. Also while good food does take time and we were in no rush today, there was a noticeable delay in getting our food delivered to the table. It didn't detract from our experience today, but another party may have complained if they were in a rush. Luckily we had time to enjoy the great food and service today.",

It is normally a 5 star experience, but I was there last night with a friend and unfortunately they are slipping a bit. Don't get me wrong, still great food and very good service, just not the meticulous outstanding service I've experienced in the past. It's the attention to detail that separate the good from the outstanding, which should be standard in an upper end steak house. Just a few examples: the bartender had no idea how to make a sour (and when I finally did finish my pseudo sour and ordered a glass of wine, the empty glass was still on the table as we were moving on to dessert); the sides were left on the table and not plated; we asked for steak sauce and got a bottle of A-1. I asked the server, \"Didn't you used to have your own Bobby Van's sauce?\" and he returned with a small cup that we carefully rationed; we had to ask for a water refill each time we finished (which I will say the waiter promptly provided, but really, should you have to ask ...?) and we felt a bit rushed as we were winding down. Will I return? Yes. But, please, they need to get back to the first class service that has been their staple.",

The water. Steak was supposed to be medium rare, however mine still had a pulse and the accompanying sauce was given to my wife for her asparagus (which frankly, I'm pretty sure was only given steroids and not an ounce of seasoning). The seafood platter that you'll see everyone ordering, don't bother. Granted it isn't a seafood spot but messing up Lobster is a skill I didn't think one could have. Bobby can do better.",

Ooo n I asked the same waiter to ask the manger to see the volt n he said he dont think its possible, come to find out he never asked the manager for us. But in the end I got to see the volt that's why I really came here n because my bf asked the manager he allowed us to. Food was good. But honestly because of him I didnt enjoy my time here. N the only reason I didn't report him is because I dont want it to be on my heart if he gets written up n eventually loose his job. But I'm sure other people will complain on him soon. Smh",

Both of our steaks were way overdone..my filet mignon so much so, that i had to send it back...like a piece of shoe leather. My husband felt too embarrassed to send his back as well and picked at his $62 steak. That of course, was his fault because they would have graciosly made him another as well. By the time my redo came 20 mins later, i was no longer hungry (after eating apps and sides)and took it home. Ate it for lunch today...it was just meh. Though the service was gracious, a $200 meal shouldn't go down this way. Very hit or miss. Wont be back.",

They took it back and sent me a new one which was only marginally better. I have (often) had better meat from a supermarket. Also, we wanted to order a good tawny Port for an after dinner drink. They had 10, 20, 30 and 40 year on the menu. All but the 10 year (not very good) was \"sold out.' I ordered apple strudel ala mode for dessert. It was barely work, and the deep middle was actually cold. I give 2 starts rather than 1 because the service was pretty good, the oysters were good, the slab bacon was decent and the garlic mashed potatoes were very good. I don't think we'll be going back to Bobby Van's, which is a shame. It used to be very good.",

Only slight negative was the service/training. Server was nice but made mistakes (didn't offer wine taste on $100 bottle), slow.  Without the Groupon, not worth it.",

The sides were hit and miss. The garlic mashed potatoes were a complete surprise. It looked bland but it was creamy, garlicky, well-seasoned, and overall the best side dish. The most disappointing was the parmesan truffle fries. The stale fries covered with cheese bits had almost no truffle taste. The cheese also had no cheese flavor. The Mac and Cheese was also bland and watery. For an appetizer we ordered sliced bacon. Although they were generous with their portions, through bacon itself was hard, chewy, and did not have a lot of flavor. Overall all, go and get the steaks and garlic mashed potatoes. Skip everything else. ( We're not big drinkers but they have an impressive wine list. So if you like wine you should stop by.)",
