It's now 20 minutes past the 11:45am delivery time, so I call the restaurant and they say that it's going to take up to another 30 minutes for the food to arrive? And I feel that's if we're lucky - I'm not holding my breath.  Other than the terrible ordering process, the food is pretty good.

You are doing something very strange and if it arrives cold I really can't feel bad for you. Unless you have no legs get off your tush and walk in. If you have no legs, well. If it's diabete's related I'm not sure you should be eating fried sushi anyway. I half a mile from here, and I live a block from Nano Sushi, and yet I take the extra couple blocks walk and pay the extra dollar or two each and every time. You can taste where that dollar goes. The fish is always fresh, every ingredient is always perfect and the presentation is always worth a picture. At this stage I've tried nearly everything on their menu, if it sounds like something you would like, then more than likely you will like it. The BYOB pertains to beer and wine, and there is a 711 a block down the street if you needed such. No liquor. So you know.  I've once waited 8 minutes for a table and that happened on a Friday night, other than that the place is always semi slow. Which is nice as they help you immediately and feed you as quick as possible. I honestly cannot say how fortunate I am to live so close to my favorite sushi restaurant, and that it is affordable and consistently perfect.  I could do without the music. Why I am forced to listen to blaring techno at a dimly lit sushi bar is beyond me, I suppose it is the edge of boys town so I let it slide. Also, I dislike the desserts, but that is an across the board thing. Their food blows our mind if you want cheese cake go to the cheese cake factory.",

I called to place a very simple order for delivery and the woman I spoke with was incredibly difficult to communicate with.  I had to give her my order and information several times.  She repeated the order back to me and said it would be 45 minutes to an hour for delivery.  I asked how long it would be for pick-up and she just kept repeating 45 min to an hour which made absolutely no sense to me.  But we hung up and I waited the hour to receive my order.  When I finally got it, it was wrong.  Despite repeating the order back to me, she entered it incorrectly.  I called to get it corrected and again, she couldn't communicate at all.  She kept repeating that I would get a \"credit\" but could not articulate how it would work.  There was no offer to bring me the correct order and no apology.  I asked to speak to someone else (literally anyone else) and she said she is the only person there.  Again, this makes no sense to me.  I worked in food service for several years and usually have a lot of patience (things go wrong sometimes and that's okay) but this was just unacceptable.  Will not be returning.",

Be sure to try to Dragon and Rainbow rolls.  The portions are fairly substantial. 2-3 rolls should be good for 2 people, depending on how hungry you are. The decor is very modern. If you did not look at the menu, you would not think that this is a Japanese restaurant. the service was pretty good despite a full house when I went.  Overall, this place serves up decent Japanese fare with a twist, at a decent price for an enjoyable meal.",

I noticed the place was well decorated and decided to go in on another occasion to dine in.  I was very happy with the quick and friendly service as well as how quickly the meals were prepared for me. I ordered the Spicy Miso Soup, Spicy Salmon Roll, and Fried Rice. No regrets and well worth the price. Again, the place is well decorated and made the whole experience enjoyable.",

It was simply one of the worst Thai food I've ever had and trust me, I have been to enough Thai restaurants in the city.  I should have figured since 3/4 of the menu is Japanese and the remaining is Thai.  I ordered the spicy udon noodles with chicken, chicken panang curry, tom kha with shrimp, spicy tuna hand roll, and spicy squid maki.  Everything minus the sushi was sub-par.  If it weren't for the decent sushi, I would have given this place 1 star.  The worst of those dishes was the spicy udon noodles.  It was disgusting.  I took 1 bite and could not go for a second one and didn't even bother to take it home (Yes, it was that bad).  The service too was sub-par to mediocre.  We were seated at a table with no utensils, water was not refilled, and server took a while to bring back our credit card receipt EVEN though my husband went and paid at the counter which usually means people are in a hurry to leave.  Upside is it is BYOB and the decor and music are pretty good.  I really wanted to like this place but sadly I will not be returning to this place.",

This place is walking distance from my house and I've never been disappointed. I love noodle dishes and sushi, and Jai Yen does an excellent job with both. Prices are very reasonable and service is speedy and friendly.",

I also wasn't all the satisfied with the spider roll, to be honest; it tasted a little fishy, but i'm not sure whether that was a sauce they added or not. I may stop in to get my sushi fix, but I'm not sure how often I'll really be stopping by. Hopefully, you'll enjoy it more than i did. The atmosphere was nice though. The spicy miso was yummy.",

Really fast, pleasant staff, overall just very very solid.",
