While they open at 7am, the party starts at 8 when the fresh croissants come out the oven. On the menu, you\u2019ll find a variety of traditional styled coffees made plain, or sweetened with one of their homemade syrups. The baristas craft their drinks with precision and passion, and the small staff on hand treat every guest as family. I seriously recommend taking a minute during the morning rush to sit down and have a vanilla bean latte, glass of sparkling water, and a fresh toasted bagel. You\u2019ll immediately have a new morning routine!",
