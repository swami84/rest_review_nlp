To my surprise, after being served what we ordered, I was very saddened and disappointed with the poor quality of the food. Chow mein was half cooked and had a toasted like quality. It literally looked like ramen before being cooked!! We were charged for a plate we never received and once we spoke to one of the servers, they seemed annoyed and started speaking their own native language. They didn\u2019t apologize , they seemed very upset, however we were being charged $18 for something we didn\u2019t receive! Also, we didn\u2019t know they had drinks, we were only served water. We also got a sauce that LITERALLY TASTED LIKE NAIL POLISH REMOVER! It was insane!!! I was so disappointed with the quality in general. I swear I have never tasted something so bad and my family and I are not picky at all. We ate only a certain portion of food because we didn\u2019t want to seem rude. This was the worst experience. The server we had almost threw the plate at us. Her way of serving was pretty harsh and wasn\u2019t really amigable. This was our first and LAST time in this place!!",

I hated that the menu simply said \u201cBeef Noodle Soup\u201d and not tell you much of what was in it or maybe put the actual name. I\u2019ve been to far better Chinese places for much cheaper too. It seemed like it was trying to be upscale. If you\u2019re actually Asian and don\u2019t want gross Americanized, salty food, don\u2019t come here. It\u2019s one of those places you walk into and just see a ton of older people and immediately know the quality of the restaurant.  That being said the service was fine and they were accommodating for a vegetarian friend and made him orange tofu instead of chicken. Portions aren\u2019t bad but I didn\u2019t think the taste was all that good for the cost.",

We ordered the hot and sour soup, General Tso's Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein, and the potstickers.  Everthing was really good!  But be careful because everything comes oit really hot!  Blow on your food.  The potstickers are really big and delicious.  The chow mein was a little different than expected and was the least favorite.  We expected soft noodles but this chow mein was like toasted cup o noodles with the chicken, bamboo, broccoli, and sauce on top.  I wouldnt order this plate again.  The General Tso's was good but I would have liked to compare it to their orange chicken.  Can't beat their location!  Right in the heart of Chinatown next the the fire station.  Take your Chinatown tourist picture in front of the famous entrance gateway and then a few steps to the restaurant.  It shouldn't disappoint.",
