This place required advanced booking and they take hold of your credit card with a charge of $25 per person in case if you not would show up. However they were very flexible,  I came 30 minutes late (I called them and warned of me getting late) and we have no problem.",

My personal favorites: grilled kale, little gem salad, fingerling potatoes, tabbouleh, prawn tagliatelle, NY strip steak, pork chop, tarte citron, and the Basque cheesecake! Plus a fantastic wine list. You'd spend WAY more for the same high quality ingredients elsewhere...this is an amazing spot for locals and it's definitely worth the trip if you're not from the neighborhood!",

The 1st waitress (did not get her name) was really nice. She did not see us initially,  bit as she glanced over, she kicked ot into gear and grabbed a fresh bottle of water. She then suggested the corn...wow, I love corn and it was grilled to perfection.  Slightly crunchy on outside and juicy on the inside. Afterwards, Krinstina took over and it was a real joy. She had a great sense of humor, and gave us a rundown of what she liked. We went with the Kale Caesar, Crispy Brussels Sprouts and the Chicken which they made into a special. Now, this night they ran out of steak and pork chops, which to me shows the quick turnover they get. The restaurant was full including the bar. Between the service of Kristina and the others, along with the owner; kept us entertained. Had the ice cream with expresso shot that ended the meal or the dining experience.  Also had a wine from Italy, called Skerjl?  It was crisp with strong hints of orange. If I could stay linger I would. Quaint place, simple decorations. Who cares about decor when food and service is great!  A definite gem in the neighborhood!",

        "caption": "My experience here was a bit of a conundrum. We waited about 15 min for a table for 2. Reasonable for a Saturday night. Ordered quickly- oddly our server \"downsold\" us on the wine- from a $40 bottle we were interested in to the $18/500ml house wine. It turned out to be pretty good so maybe she was just being honest? They were out of the lamb shoulder, which we wanted to try but it was 9pm and it was busy so I guess that's understandable. Had the toasts, skirt steak and chicken sandwich. The toasts and steak were great. They chicken sandwich a bit weird- the chicken version of a french dip; didn't quite work. Hopefully this place improves. Could be good.",
