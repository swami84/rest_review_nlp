Table for 2. We ordered the ribs and the unagi (eel) sushi as appetizers, both were enough to share. The ribs were falling off the bone. It was savory bbq-like sauce and was coated in nuts. The eel sushi was disappointing. It tasted like packaged eel and the sushi rice was just falling apart.  For ramen, we ordered the point blank and shoyu ramen. You can add a $3 egg (!!!). The point blank was a disappointment. The horseradish was so overwhelming you really can't taste anything else. If you enjoy eating mouthfuls of wasabi, then coughing, then this is for you. The shoyu ramen was much more traditional and was the better choice. You can really taste the umami from the fish base broth and bonito. The broth was light but flavorful and hearty. It really hit the spot on the winter afternoon. Both came with charsui, however, of the pork loin variety, not the pork belly kind. So it was dry and didn't have much flavorful.  Overall great service. Interesting and \"fun\" flavors.  My only complaint is that I wish they had a choice between hot tea or ice cold water. We're out in the patio in the cold and there was no choice of hot tea? Hmm.",

The Ramen had Chicken Broth with aged Pork and I'm not a big fan of chicken broth so that might be why the Ramen was meh to me. Probably the best part of the ramen was noodle.

I added chashu (pork), which I didn't like, because it was sightly chewy. It was filling and for a creamy broth, it didn't feel greasy. The staff was friendly and the ambiance is entertaining, with lots of details to look at. The menu could use some work; it's fun to have a whimsical menu, but I and other customers were asking lots of simple questions because many items have vague descriptions.  All in all a good meal, but not worth the unpredictable waits that come with the crowds it drives in. There are other good ramen options nearby (and elsewhere in the city).",

Ton of sake to choose from (no hot sake though, bummer). 3 choices of ramen. Wine and whiskey are coming soon.  The bao buns were a little chewy. The edamame was pretty good. Covered in garlic which I was okay with but if you\u2019re not a garlic lover you may want to keep looking.  The captain Brooklyn ramen is a veggie broth (mushroom and seaweed) and supposedly quite spicy though no one seemed to have any issues with the amount of spice. Also comes with the fun shield (you don\u2019t keep the shield) that you use to protect yourself from the splatters of hot oil. Lots of fun marvel Easter eggs around the restaurant.  The chef special, pork broth ramen, was pretty good. The broth itself was a little salty (fine by me but not for all) and very tasty! The broth was the best part of the night!! Comes with a garnish in top and bamboo shoots. You have to order everything else. I do wish I could have added corn. Also, nothing currently for adding spice. Luckily the waitress snagged a bit of spice for us which was great!  Luckily we were in the first group seated. Opens at 5pm...by 5:20 the wait was over an hour. By 5:40 the wait topped 2 hours.  It wasn\u2019t the best I\u2019ve had but certainly better than many (if not most) I\u2019ve tried in NY! I would change the menu to explain what comes in each bowl of ramen, add corn, spice, and hot sake. Otherwise this was a good spot. I probably won\u2019t be making the trek back to Brooklyn for this ramen alone but if you\u2019re in the neighborhood and looking for some good food, you\u2019ll enjoy this new ramen shop!",

        "caption": "Came here tonight on opening night, busy even at 9p. I expected nothing less in waiting. After I was kindly seated at the counter/bar the food and drinks I ordered arrived quite quickly. The service and hospitality is overall very very good. I tried the oxtail which was very delicious but the high price tag for 1 piece makes me question the worth of it. I then tried the Capt Brooklyn which might've been gimmicky in which they give you a small Capt America shield to protect yourself from the splashing oil that they pour over the bowl of ramen. I did feel a little bit if splash so gimmicky as it may be it does help shield you a bit. As for the point of it, it highly reminded me of the fire ramen I tried in Kyoto where they set your ramen on fire. It brings out a very fragrant smell and I'm sure it adds some flare to it. As for the noodles they were well cooked and the soft egg was perfect. As for the broth, it isn't for the faint of heart, it started off quite tame then as you eat and drink more of it the spiciness level catches up to you very quickly!  Overall food and service makes me highly recommend this place although it is quite expensive but for the area and being in NYC you really can't expect affordability when the restaurants need to pay the high rent. Also I would like to see how this location plays out as I think they may run into the troubles of lines out the door and people taking their time eating which might affect their service. I hope this won't be the case.",
