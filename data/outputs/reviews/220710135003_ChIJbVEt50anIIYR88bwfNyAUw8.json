The food was very well prepared and very tasteful!!!  So I came from Atlanta to visit and it was suggested to come here from other hospitality review companies. Nonetheless, due to the 11pm curfew concierge warned us about; we decided to call to make a reservation as suggested. Upon calling at 9pm we were told by the host over the phone, no reservations were taken but we could walk in \u201cit was empty\u201d. The website validated this information as did their social media - \u201cno reservations taken\u201d. We show up and end up standing on line for 30+ minutes which was fine, but when we got to the door - Thomas was at the door and asked our party count. There was three of us. We continued to stand for 20+ minutes awaiting a table patiently until a party of three asked us if they could squeeze by. Apparently, they knew the other host that gladly let them in alongside Thomas with no questions asked or regard for those at the door. After a additional 15 minutes of waiting, my friend asked Thomas how long was the wait, he quoted us an additional 25 minutes. At that point we made mention we saw him let people in that staff was familiar with, he stated \u201cthey made a reservation\u201d I then let him know we called a hour before and was told \u201cno reservations were accepted\u201d he told us \u201cthey made it yesterday\u201d. After Thomas walked away we grabbed a random host and asked him what was the reservation policy in which he stated reservations were not accepted.  It is now 11:18 and we were escorted onto the top floor in which was empty - sat and handled instantly.  Me being in the industry I think it\u2019s terrible to let people wait over a hour as you barade regulars past them as their dollars matter more.  Since sitting, service has been well. I will not return though and do not recommend. We weren\u2019t drunk, we came to shoot footage regarding the hospitality sector. It starts at the door and the disrespect was disgusting.",

We had a Reservation for 7:30pm and waited outside (in a separate line for people who had reserved), until 8:30pm. This by itself would probably already be the worst case of overbooking I have witnessed at a Restaurant, but the mis-management doesn't stop there. Mambo's also kept a separate line for people who didn't reserve, and let those people in at the same pace as the people who reserved. So instead of waiting 30 min because they let too many people reserve for 7:30, you now wait 1 hour. The solution is quite simple, don't do Reservations if you don't understand how they work. Or if you do Reservations, and people are waiting outside 1 hour past their Reservation time, don't let walk-ins sit down in their place. Then again this a tourist trap on Bourbon Street so they probably don't care about customers returning. The food itself was ok, they deep fry all their seafood in a thick batter, likely to cover up for a lack of quality in ingredients. So many better places to eat in the same price range in NOLA, and they won't make you wait 60 min past your reservation time.",

Oysters had amazing flavor (even better with Tabasco on them) and the alligator was great! Alligator was a little salty but great Cajun flavor. I liked that it wasn\u2019t deep fried so you could see and taste the alligator instead of the breading like most places. The red fish was a good dish. Flavor was good, not fishy at all. The mustard greens were ok (not a fan of them anyways but tried them) and the taste of New Orleans was just ok. We ordered it for our niece who has never had Cajun food. It\u2019s a good little sampler. The gumbo was ok. I probably wouldn\u2019t order that dish again. Everything else was really good. We finished with the bread pudding and added a scoop of ice cream and it did not disappoint! So good! Highly recommend that! The oysters and bread pudding were my top favorites. The service was also real good. 100% would recommend this place.",

I liked the rockefeller oysters better that's what kept us coming back. My boyfriend hadn't tried gator before so after making him try he fell in love and didn't order anything other than the gator. Their gator tasted so different it wasn't as chewy , our waiter WALTER helped us twice out of our 3 visits he had great customer service. Our final visit I had steak, potatoes, greens and etoufee and I'm actually eating the left overs now. Everything was seasoned so well",

It is because of restaurants with staff, cuisine, and hospitality like Mambo!  Everyone was friendly and inviting to my group. They made sure that we were greeted properly, our order was correct and up to standard, and also blessed us with an amazing view with heaters to keep us warm while we dined-in. The food was so amazing that we ended up sharing our meal around the table as if we were at a feast. No one could close in on just one dish!  Our waiter, Joshua, was the icing on the cake for us. He was kind, knowledgeable, humorous, and overall great at his job!  If you are looking for somewhere to go that has great music, energy, food, and staff...Mambo's is the right choice!",

Our server was nice and engaging; however, it took an exorbitant amount of time to get our beers. They came out about the same time as appetizers.  The gator bites were good. If you like heavy blackening seasoning in your food, keep your order standard. If you want more flavor, you may want to ask for medium or bronzed. The oysters were good size and good flavor, and priced pretty well comparatively.  The main courses were ok. The gator po'boy was way over peppered, which was strange because the gator bites were perfect. The shrimp pasta Alfredo had a ton of grease, but had good flavor. The kids burger was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor. The red beans and rice were the best in the Taste of New Orleans. The seafood plate was ok, but again way overdone with the blackening seasoning.  The amount of food was portioned well. It was enough to not leave room for dessert. Unfortunately, where we are staying has no fridge, so we couldn't take leftovers or order dessert to go. I would still go back for a second chance on the food, and at least try the desserts.",

Everything was very well packaged and still hot. I will note the breading on the alligator bites was slightly soggy but that's impossible to avoid when putting something hot in a sealed container; I'll reiterate that they were the table favorite.

My 35 weeks pregnant girlfriend and I were on a mission to find a suitable establishment to get something delicious for lunch in the French Quarter. My girlfriend, in her advanced stage of pregnancy, would only be able to walk a very short distance and it was important that we not go too far from our hotel. We were dismayed to find so many of our options had been eliminated before our search began by the ever inconveniencing Covid.  We had nearly given up when we strolled up on Mambo's.  The lady at the door was welcoming and when she saw my girlfriend struggling to find her mask in her purse, she told her not to bother and offered her one that the restaurant had ready. We were invited to the 3rd floor and were seated.  The server introduced herself and with a very friendly and accommodating attitude. She recommended the specials which sounded wonderful although we ultimately ordered off of the menu instead. We had the redfish prepared two different ways which we exchanged samples of. Both dishes proved to be top of the line and made the lunch quite enjoyable. I finished my grilled redfish as well as the two side which were a delicious cup of cheese grits and a cup of greens that was superb.  My girlfriend completed her sides and asked for a box to bring home her blackened Mango's redfish topped with a crawfish sauce. The bill was a bit more than I was hoping to spend but the food and service were certainly worth the extra expense. I look forward to exploring more of the menu in the future.",

The food arrived pretty promptly for a Friday night, and it was still hot. We got the fish platter, the fish po' boy, and the New Orleans sampler. It was way too much food for our family of five because the portions were so generous! The beans and rice with sausage were our favorite. My husband liked the crawfish etoufee, and I liked the jambalaya. The kids ate the fried fish and fries, which were both really yummy. The hushbpuppies were also great. My only complaint is that the tartar sauce wasn't great.",

The hostess Amy provided awesome customer service from the street side prior to entry, during our dinner experience, and when leaving! 5 \ud83c\udf1f rating for her!  Our dinner experience hit a rating bump. So my two young daughters and I ordered food. The kids off the kids menu and ordered the cheeseburgers (plain with pickles, so not difficult). The food arrives and no cheeseburgers, just plain hamburgers. I mentioned the error to the waitress and she doesn't return. I flag her down and mention the error again and she brings out two cups of shredded cheddar cheese. At this point Amy comes over with the manager in tow. I explained that my girls ordered cheeseburgers and I would prefer to have the cheese melted on correctly and not cups of cold shredded cheese added by us.  They fixed the issue and the waitress never came around again! I needed a refill on water and finally I mentioned to Amy that we would like to leave if I could have our bill... would be great! They did offer a military discount, but a poor service discount would have been better, especially when customers are down due to the COVID pandemic!  Amy saved the Mambo's rating for being AWESOME in customer service!",

The best sides ever! The greens and red beans where so good. I wish I had room for desert but the portions were so big. You could easily feed two people with these sides. I'll definitely be back again on my next stop in New Orleans. Thanks for the best experience. Not to mention the prices are very fair.",

My friend and I accidentally met while walking around the French Quarter, the bar on the balcony is excellent, not crowded, I really liked the hotel. with Maria (bartender). Be sure to try the gumbo (final picture included)  A good place We made a simple lunch in Mambo, we both ordered gumbo and added blackened shrimp. Honestly, gumbo was good, but not the best we ate on our recent trip. , but the blackened shrimp, which we added at the suggestion of our server, put it on top. The service was good, the prices were ok and we will be back.  Best service The food is great and affordable, be sure to try the nachos alligator. Among other things, we had a waiter named Ponce, who did everything possible for us, very friendly and gave us convenient places for walking, since we are not here. I really appreciate this place and its staff  Ponce AWESOME !!! Awesome service from Ponce, such a welcoming person. The food was outstanding! Highly recommend nachos alligator.  Great food and service This is my very first time in New Orleans, and the family met here for dinner. Made me talk, but I finally tried alligator bites! This is really very good! ! Our server, Sarah, helped me overcome my fear of eating Gator LOL. The atmosphere is fun and the rest of our food was supposed to die for! The best part, indeed, was the service with a smile. Is she good enough to convince me to eat an alligator? ! Thumbs up!  Overnight in Mambo Went to Mambo for a night with friends and family! Sat on the rooftop bar and had the best waitress, Sarah! The windows offer magnificent views of Bourbon Street, and if you are hungry and want to cool the roof, this is the place for you! We ordered alligator and oyster mambo bites! Everything was so delicious, from food to drinks (blueberry sangria is the best)! Sarah was a great waitress, she is funny and very cute! She really made this night so fun for us! Thank! !

We made it back to Mambo\u2019s. Delicious dishes we had three appatizers so big we couldn't make it past that. Delicious Alligator bites, crab cakes, and their gumbo is to die for!

But on the way out I saw the Gator Nachos and realized I had missed out! I urge you to please stop by and give this place a try, it is delicious. The best part of our lunch was our sever who went above and beyond to make us feel like family. If you go in ask for Quincy. He provided EXCEPTIONAL service and was accommodating to my entire family's needs. Thank you Mambo's and THANK YOU Quincy. We will be back again to see you!",
