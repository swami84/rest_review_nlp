They mostly do takeout and delivery, but there are a few booths and tables. We placed our order and paid at the counter, then took a seat. Water was brought and refilled, service was surprisingly attentive and food came out super fast. Portions were such that we had leftovers and there was no problem with anything we asked for. Garlic sauce had a little spice and was really garlicky, but not overpoweringly so. General Tso\u2019s was really great, and potstickers taste homemade. Definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chicago.",

I've had everything from the sushi to the traditional Chinese-American stuff (chicken, beef) and all cuisines have been excellent. Prices are more than reasonable, even a bargain, I would say.

Sesame chicken definitely did not use a sauce made from scratch. Very certain it's a sauce in a jar. Tasted very light but also too sweet for its color. The chicken was decently cooked.  The fried rice was a bit bland but a little soy sauce made it pretty good.  Now the upsetting part. The crab Rangoon here is very mediocre. Tasted weird and it explained the cheap price on it. I'm very sure these were frozen and store bought  3/5 at best. Not a bad place for the price.",

When that was confirmed, they said they were just closing when it clearly states they are open from 11am-10pm. I asked about my order and why I hadn't received it yet, they said they didn't know where the address was. Nobody had called me to figure anything out, so were they planning on just taking my money and not giving me the goods I had paid for?
