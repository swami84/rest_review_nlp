A word of warning....the spice is real. I'm usually pretty into spicy foods and go for \"asian hot,\" but their hot is really up there. I enjoyed my dish, but if you are just looking for a light tang from some sriracha then don't go the hot route. Overall, I'd say the dishes have a great portion/taste to price. It's also a good spot if you're counting macros or trying to track your eating.",

When I called about the utterly distasteful food, the owner had an attitude over the phone as if my complaints weren\u2019t valid. My friend also tried this gross establishment. The system wouldn\u2019t process her order. When the employee asked the owner for help, he didn\u2019t know what he was doing! I tried to give the restaurant another shot. The orange chicken was soggy and had very little flavor. The vegetables had no flavor. They were overcooked and soggy. The rice was mushy and gummy. I try to support local businesses, but it\u2019s hard to do so when management sucks and lacks common sense. I will never step foot in this establishment ever again. Good luck making it past five years!",
