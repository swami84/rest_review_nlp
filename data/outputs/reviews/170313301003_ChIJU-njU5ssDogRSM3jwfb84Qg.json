It was a super pleasant experience from the courtesy phone call letting me know my mistake to picking up and chatting with one of the employees. However, the best part was the food was absolutely delicious. No knock to Curry House, but I think the dishes from here tasted a notch better overall. The tandoori chicken was so moist and flavorful as opposed to overcooked dryness that you get sometimes. The same came be said for the chicken curry. It was like the dishes were stewed at the perfect time just for my order. In the future, I will absolutely make a point to order from this location. 9/10 portions to price",

Selections are slightly smaller than usual Indian buffets but every item was delicious! Their samosas were packed and filled with all the good stuff. My favorite was the butter chicken and tandori chicken. The butter chicken was amazing, thinking about the taste is making my mouth water right now. Their mango pudding was also very delicious, I had about 2 bowls. The rice pudding was lacking some flavor. They are suppose to be know for the Momo dumplings but we were too full to order. Next time I would love to try the momo dumplings and would probably do a la carte instead of the buffet. The servers were nice and constantly came over to refill our waters. Cannot wait to come back! Okay not gonna lie, I'm hungry after writing this review.",

Tasty and well executed. Mostly vegetarian dishes, great \"chicken Tikka masala\", though I think it may have had a slightly different name. This might be my own lack of sophistication, but it seemed pretty identical in offerings and flavors to my local Indian restaurant. So, don't feel like adventure is too much a prerequisite for a visit. Like I said, it is well executed.",

They asked me to sit on a single seater table(very small) with opposite seats. Only other tables they have were 4 seaters. Most of them were empty but they refused to give it to us because we are not 4 people. They were am very very rude and it felt like we were there to eat in free.. very insulting.

I was able to watch an entire movie before the food was delivered.  I could have cooked this myself and still been finished cooking and eating before this was every delivered  Not to mention would have been much cheaper that way  The food was COLD only ONE serving of rice for two main dishes. Who does that?  Portions are excessively small especially for extreme high price you pay for them.  Food quality was only mediocre AT BEST.  Oddly enough much better the second day but still.  AVOID AT ALL COST!  You can do better, you will find much better in Chicago this is not the Indian food restaurant you are looking for.  Run away! This was A HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I HAVE MADE.  I have requested that GrubHub remove them from their list of restaurants.",

So when our entree arrived, we asked about our app. It was then brought to our table cold. We were still charged for it.  Then, when the manager brought the check for payment, I started to say \u201cthank you,\u201d but he turned his back on me and walked away before I could get the words out.  It felt as though the staff was indifferent to our experience. Frankly, the manager was quiet rude.  The food that came out hot tasted pretty good. But the portions were small.  I wouldn\u2019t go back. There\u2019s too much else within walking distance to waste time and money on mediocre food and bad service.",

The last time we physically used that credit card was at Nepal House. I can't prove that someone at the restaurant was involved in the fraud, but can't completely ignore the fact that we don't typically use that card. They did take the card by the register to charge our meal while we were still seated. Maybe other customers reading this have had the same experience afterwards, in which case, we can prove a trend...",

This is definitely my new go-to place for Indian Nepali  buffet! The service is great as well. The staff is very attentive with refilling drinks and clearing plates off the table, even when my dining buddy and I stayed for nearly 2 hours! We...lost track of time in the midst of our gluttony, lol. Additionally, they were very friendly in terms of making conversation as opposed to other restaurants I've been to. I highly recommend trying Nepal house out!! On your marks...get set...GO!",

The lamb tikka was very gamy, tough to chew and not well marinated. The basmati rice was not correctly cooked. Paying close to $15 for daal makhani was bit of a waste since regular grocery stores carry this in a food pouch for under $4 which tastes similar. Charging for sauces like Raita while many other restaurants serve it as complimentary.  Staff & Service - quite unprofessional. The staff seemed all over the place, not very well organized. There was another customer who had placed his order for pickup an hour before he got there and still had to wait for his food. The employee was justifying why the order was late rather than providing exceptional customer service. When we got there we noticed the restroom did not have any hand soap and a broken towel dispenser - we saw multiple employees use the restroom and continue to serve and go back in the kitchen.  The restaurant could use professional management and employ best practices across the board to make it a much better experience for customers.",

We decided to do the buffet but as we got our first plates of food, the server came by and told us to get whatever else we needed from the buffet to get now as they were going to be putting up everything at 2:30. I was very disappointed and felt if he had told us that before seating us, would have saved the time and inconvenience to hoard plates of food on our table or being asked to scarf down lunch because they had to clean up. It felt like an insult, because I have worked in the hospitality business, I understand they have specific buffet hours but why can't they let patrons finish that are already in the restaurant instead of removing everything or asking them to grab as many plates as they wanted before the buffet is going to be put up. On a side note, the food itself was mediocre at best, butter chicken was disgustingly sweet, the noodles were bland, the greens were very runny. I will not return here.",
