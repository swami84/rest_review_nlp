        "caption": "(Translated by Google) Buffet at Diamond Head Tower 3F at Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort & Spa  \u30fb It is popular and should be reserved in advance. Start around 18:00.  \u30fb Table staff is more experienced and more Japanese than Japanese. Since everyone is good at Japanese, people who are not good at English do not feel anxious.  \u30fb The crab is popular and you can eat as much as you like. A crab shell bucket is placed on the table. Bring a lot of towels and add them as soon as you ask.  \u30fb Order liquor and drinks once they arrive at the table. Juice is also on the buffet. Speaking of hot drink \u2615 will bring you.  \u30fb The menu is abundant, and the miso soup was delicious and I was kind to my stomach.  \u30fb Menu changes a little every day.  \u30fb Check out at the table. The same applies to room charges. Speak to the table staff and bring it.

Nice for special occasions though. Or if you're in the mood to stuff yourself with crab, sashimi/sushi, and other local delicacies. I'd definitely go back and I recommend going at least once.",

We had an hour wait and our time estimate was 9pm but luckily there were some interesting things to do for an hour. We also got the kamaaina rate, 25%. The buffet was a wide variety of food, I'm not sure if it's the same food everyday but I would say it was a good selection of food. Anyways, cash, check, debit/credit accepted. Bathrooms available too, without the use of an access card, escalator and elevators available to carry our full selves, enough seatings for a group of 5-10 (maybe). There are outside balcony seating with a tent, tables for 2, 4. Parking with the valet is available but we didn't utilize the valet parking. I think they validate the valet parking since our waiter asked. The buffet is on the 3rd floor after walking past the hotel gym, until you see people eating. You really can't miss it. Anyways, see pics. Aloha.  Edit: We recently visited on October 10 and they have added more and taken some off the menu too. They have pasta, a kids menu which had mac n cheese and chicken strips, also juice. They have taken off the sashimi which they used to have but no more. They do have California sushi though. The menu may have changed according to the seasons. (I'm assuming). Some of the menu are still served.",

        "caption": "Was pretty disappointed by this place honestly. Should be priced at around $30 for this kind of food. The Poke was slimy and has zero flavouring. It really just was a jumble of tuna mixed in with some garnishing. But something was off with the tuna as I said it was slimy. I've have poke at over 30 places and this was a total letdown. The crab legs were also a shame, they sit in a pot of boiling water for hours until they are served, sucking every last bit of flavour out of them. Total waste of king crab being served this way, even chicken has more flavour than this. The vegetables were nice and plentiful but that's hard to mess up and the desserts were laid out right beside the queue to get in, I wonder how many sneezing kids contaminated that station. All in all not at all worth the price at over $60 pp with tips. Will not be going here again.",

The tables themselves are close together, so you really have to watch not hitting someone when going up to get your food.  The food is okay. I think it is known for the crab legs, which I cannot eat, so woa woa on me.  Having said all this, I enjoyed the sushi bar, the fish and chicken. And the price was pretty good.",
