We finished eating and they pretty much ignored us for another 25 minutes before we could get check and container to go food. yet we were in the middle of the small restaurant  and people kept coming in to try to get seats, so I don't know how we were so ignored, no one checked on us if we needed anything else after we got our food..I heard another customer complain he never got his lemonade but they had tried to charge him for it on the bill. Another customer played his video game loudly next to us. but they didn't tell him to turn it down. The chairs have high handles and don't allow you to pull it close to under the table so my 4 year old had trouble getting close to table. The food was tasty but not worth this long wait.

The wait staff and cooks seem to be the same person sometimes. The last time I went it took over 30 minutes from the time we ordered to the time the food arrived. The place is cozy and there were hardly any patrons. The resturants around them had lines out the door. No restrooms. Better go before you get there.

One of the best I have ever tasted! The place is always packed and the wait for take out food is longer than most, but the meal is worth it. Everything must be made fresh daily because they run out of choices of sides by 12 pm. Ordered pork chop dinners w 2 sides, yams and Mac, that I ate later that evening.  I thought the pork chop would be smothered, but it was fried. It was ok, but I think I'll stick with the catfish. Not everyone can cook it and they cook it to perfection!",

Definitely no stars for the food or service. Service was TERRIBLE for us to be the only 2 people in the restaurant. I ordered catfish with a side of Mac and yams. The macaroni should be called just that cause it had NO cheese. A sprinkle... But that\u2019s it. The yams were far from southern candied yams. Waaaay too much cinnamon. My girlfriend got meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy and kale. The kale was the best part haha which is weird for a soul food restaurant? Meatloaf was OK, smothered in ketchup. Mashed potatoes and gravy were also alright. Again, I\u2019m from Chicago where the food is FYE. Lol maybe y\u2019all east coasters just don\u2019t know nothing about soul food ;) Anyway, I\u2019ll probably not come back to this place. But it has over 4 stars, so maybe whoever is reading this will like it more!",

Once our food came out husbands food was wrong sent it back and they brought it out wrong again at which the waitress came out as if we were wrong. After finally receiving the correct order she comes back after we started eating asking if we wanted the cornbread that came with the meal uhhh yeah comes with it.

The restaurant was not busy, I just watched 2 customers receive fried food despite arriving 15 minutes after myself. Waitress seemed annoyed when I asked for anything. There isn't anywhere to wash your hands, they have hand sanitizer... I'm sure they have great food but I took two bites of waffle and it wasn't cooked all the way... I still never received chicken, I walked out after two bites of waffle. Worst food experience I've had in NYC. I'm sure it's a one off but someone else deserves my money more than this place.",

I can say the food has always been good. Not great or anything to write home about, but it's consistent and the portions are always more than enough for me. It always hits the spot and holds me for several hours. They do free coffee refills, which are always a great. The service used to be REALLY slow, but I've been twice in the past three weeks and that aspect has improved dramatically. The dining room is cute, looks and feels like you're literally in \"ma n pops\" eat-in kitchen, circa 1982. There's no bathroom for patrons, unfortunately, so just know that before you go to eat in. Otherwise, they do take orders for pickup. Since I live so close, I'm not sure if they do delivery through any of the apps out there.",

However, the 1 thing I believe this place needs to take them to the next level and keep them in business is SERVICE.  I am a frequent patron despite the fact that I am the only one who says \"Please, Thank you, Good morning or good night\"... this is mainly an issue over the phone but in person is rarely better.  If the service was as good as the food I would reccommend this place more. I work in the service industry and determine where to spend my money based on service. I havent stopped coming here because I dont want another black business to disappear and if they care about their customers I hope the service improves.  Afterall its like your Grandmas kitchen in there! So comfy and home-like.... but without a smile and good service, it feels like a regular old fast food restaurant full of people who hate their jobs and take it out on the customer.",

Never had any delivery person not bring my food to my 1st fl apt.  THEN, the restaurant refuses to give my money back, because she lied and said i didn't tell her I was in a wheelchair.  I than tried to call the restaurant to speak to the manager or someone in charge and this boy (yes boy, because he was unprofessional) tells me theirs no one there and he doesn't know when they come in.  I will definitely be letting everyone i know and recommended this restaurant to,  not to order from them anymore.  We'll be ordering from the soul food spot from now in.

I can't begin to say how disappointed I was. The fish NO SEASONING, the Mac n Cheese....No cheese. I mean it had a cheese flavor but there was little to NO CHEESE in a dish that I ALWAYS get and used to talk about. I thought maybe it was just my serving so as I served my children I seen theirs had no cheese either. The potatoe salad was blah as well. No seasons. I seen black pepper specks but no trace of salt. I think they may have even used sodium free mayo. I hope they get it together and go back to seasoning the food the way it's supposed to be seasoned. Or adding CHEESE to a dish that calls for CHEESE!",

I ordered a mojito ($10) while waiting for a table and it was a strong one served in a mason jar. The food was okay. I'd recommend getting the steak platter for $17 if you do decide to eat here. I ordered the mango chicken (sounds good but literally 5 pieces of chicken) served with rice and some plantains for $15. I think the food here is overpriced for what its worth, and if you're in Flushing there are other options. Another warning: food takes forever to come out. If you happen to be craving Mexican but you are stuck in Flushing, give this place a shot. Service was friendly and attentive.",
