I\u2019ve ordered other pizza and really liked it but when I go to another parlor, I can\u2019t find one that lives up to my fave. Today, my delivery driver Hector stunned me.

I inquired how he knew and he said he services the area often. In all my years I\u2019ve never had a driver deliver to me at my door and do it in such a nonchalant way. I was over the moon!

It was a small bacon and pepperoni pizza  and an order of wings. After picking up my order and returning home I noticed that I was given a chicken pizza instead. I thought no big deal being that I'm only a few blocks away, I will return it to get my correct order. I explained to the cashier that there was a mistake with my order. She apologized and called for another employee  to explain what happened and to remake the pizza. This other employee seem to get agitated to remake the pizza. The cashier said that it would take about 15 minutes and I may keep the chicken pizza if I wanted. Sure why not.  After waiting outside about 13 minutes I met the cashier at door to recieve the remade pizza. Again she apologized and thanked her.  As I get in my car to drive away, another employee waved my down to tell me to come back in the store because the manager wanted to speak with me. I thought it was to apologize for the mistake and to offer a coupon or something for the inconvenience. As I get out of my car I was met at the door by the employee who was asked to remake the pizza. He did not give me his name but he introduced himself as one of the managers. He asked if I still had the wrong order of the chicken pizza. He followed me to my car and I showed him the pizza while explaining to him that the label on the box was correctly showing my order but the pizza was incorrect. He explained that he finds it strange that I would return this half eaten chicken pizza when he has no record of ever making a chicken pizza that day and wasn't sure where I got it from. I responded that his cashier said that I could have the pizza and only starting eating it while waiting for my correct order. I also stated to him that the box clearly has his store label on it and his cashier told him that she remembered me picking up the pizza less than 7 minutes prior to me returning. I asked him if he's assuming that I switched out the pizza to return it. His response was that he wasn't sure. Wow!  After feeling that I was beginning to get upset I told him to keep that chicken pizza because he needed more than I did to investigate where it came from. After leaving the parking area I returned back to also return the pizza that was remade because at this point I was being accused of stealing and was too upset to eat it. I demand my money back after being accused of stealing for simply asking for my correct order. I asked the manager for his name but he refused to give it to me. He is short, slim frame and white.  I am in the food and beverage industry myself for over ten years and as a manager I would never treat a customer the way that this \"manager\" treated me. I only hope that this was an isolated incident and not racially motivated as I am a black Hispanic man. It is sad to say that Papa John's have lost me as a customer.",

This one has been consistent in its disappointment since moving to this area a few months ago. Just ordered a pizza through the app, was told they can\u2019t do the ingredients combo that the app let me put in, I settled for something similar. The pizza ended up being really unappealing. Cheese just falling completely off. Barely any pepperonis on it. Looked like a 2 yer old tried to cut it.  And a single large pizza costs $30 for delivery? Way too much.  It\u2019s a shame Pizza Hut is so bad in this area too. I guess we\u2019ll try local or Dominos.  Don\u2019t buy here.",

The pizza was not here by 8:05pm. I went outside to see if I could see the delivery guy. I saw him pull up on the opposite side of the street. I waited for him to get out but then he started driving further down the street. He drove all the way down the street and I thought he left so I tried to call the store. As I was calling the store I turn around and see him pulling up in front of my house I again wait for him to get out but after a brief pause in front of the house he starts driving off again I call out to him but he keeps going. After being on hold for 8 minutes I finally get someone from the store on the phone and tell them what happened. They tell me he's new and he was scared to get out of the car and that they will send him back out to me. I asked to speak to the manager but was told he was busy and I was put back on hold until the phone hung up on me. I called back and was on hold again in the meantime the delivery guy finally arrived with my pizza by this time I'm in my car getting ready to go up to the store which is literally only 1.5 miles from my house. I get out the car go over to the car the driver still doesn't bother to get out of the car he finally rolls down the passenger side window and hands me my pizza and says he's sorry. As I turned around to head into the house I opened the box to check my pizza and it's cold not even lukewarm anymore. I immediately getting in my car and drive up to the store. During this whole time I'm still on hold waiting for the store to pick up the phone. The call finally hung up while I was on my to the store timing out at a little over 21 minutes! I get in the store and then after talking with the guy at the register end up waiting for a new pizza to be made. Finally as if I hadn't had a bad enough experience he brings a pizza over to me and it's the wrong pizza! He takes it back and then brings back the right one. I finally walked out the store at 9:05 pm with a pizza that was supposed to be delivered to me by 7:54 pm!",

And another one pepperoni sausage and extra cheese. I ordered some other things. Total came up to almost 40 i thought that was fine because he said there was a special with the pizzas. I received 1 Pizza half and half. I called back the guy said he gave me what i ordered. But i never said \"half\" in any of my sentence. And then he said he read my order back when he didnt. He seemed like he was in a rush to get off the phone. I usually dont play the manager card because i think that people should be professional enough. But he wasnt and he didnt want to admit his mistake. And i asked him to work with me and give me something for waiting for an hour for a wrong order. He said NO. That there was nothing. He said i would have to pay and i told him the money wasnt the issue the issue was that he send me a wrong order and i would have to wait another hour for the damn order. He said I'll TRY to send it asap. Still got here like in 50 mins. This service is ridiculous. I dont think imma order from here again. Sad. B/c i really like their chipotle wings.",

Delia Phlatts saved me twice from my own poor planning while 45 hungry maintenance workers waited for lunch. She worked within our available funds, got the pizzas to us ON TIME and I took all the credit. :) Seriously . . . she has been most helpful and we've officially switched from Pizza Hut around the corner to THIS location because of her friendliness and efficiency AND the pizzas are delicious!!!. Sounds to me like Papa needs somebody like her on the night shift. But don't move her to the night shift . . . . we like things just as they are.",

Several times I caught them doing this; one of their best promotions is Wiz50 for the Wizard or Cap50 for the Capital if you don\u2019t know they will not tell you.  I have been trying to order online for the past 40 minutes, it would not let me send my order, when I called the store and put on hold for 15 minutes someone got on phone and told me I have to call tech support.  It is always some kind of issue at this store. Finally was able to get my online order thru, went to the store to pick it up, a young man told me it will be a few minutes.  While I was standing there another customer on the phone apparently was upset and cancelled his order.  Waited for 15 minutes a young lady asked me have I been help I told her yes, but could she check on my order.  I was told that she did not have an order for me, I was told that I did, and a confirmation email.  What I realize while standing there is that they just don't care, because of the high density of the area they will always make money.  I just left and went down the street to Oriental East and got Chinese takeout.",
