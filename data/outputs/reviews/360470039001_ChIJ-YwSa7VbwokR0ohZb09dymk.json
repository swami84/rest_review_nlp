They had shrimp and grits and the southern chicken sandwich and the fried cauliflower appetizer and the crab mac and cheese. My food was awesome, the crab cakes and sauce was really good. My waffle was perfect, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. My friends loved their food as well. One of them liked the cauliflower so much she got another one to go and I came back the next day. We also got mixed drinks which were perfect. Service, atmosphere, and food were great. Check it out, you won\u2019t be disappointed",

My friend and I were going to comedy show a few doors down (Pre-Covid) and needed something nearby to eat.  We looked over the menu and found the prices were reasonable and the selection had some delicious items.  We went inside and were seated immediately.  The bartender/waiter, Laurence, was knowledgeable and very friendly.  We started with the fried cauliflower appetizer and a couple drinks.  This fried cauliflower was amazing.  I could have wrote a whole review just based on this.  Happily, the chicken sandwich I ordered and the burger my friend got were both above expectations and we left completely satisfied.  If you have the chance definitely check this place out.",

So glad I chose the right restaurant.  I enjoyed everything here; the food was so good, chicken seasoned with flavor,  great quality wine and I cannot leave out those buttermilk homemade biscuits. Soft and buttery(thinking about it and want one now \ud83d\ude0b) My family enjoyed it, too. Plates were definitely cleaned. I was unable to eat dessert, yet, my mom loved her carrot cake.  Met one of owners and he was down-to-earth and a great attitude. That is a must!  Can't wait to return for those biscuits and trying other dish. Great jobs guys and many successful years in Brooklyn!!!",

The passion fruit syrup delicious. I paid $28 for the meal and had to buy food somewhere else..",

The ribs didn't survive. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken wings with the homemade biscuit and coleslaw. Everything on my plate was delicious. You can tell the owners have a high standard on what food should be served. You taste the spices and ingredients that are well mixed, it's like eating a homecooked meal but with elegance . I recommend this place for a date night, friends gathering, anything. I am definitely coming back. Worth every penny. The drinks are good too. I had the rasberry ice rea. I tasted the rasberry flavor. Great customer service, beautifully uniquely decorated.",

The menu is a relatively simple one, but the turkey burger I had here during the first visit was delicious and the side salad was very good.  The ice tea was great too - obviously freshly made  and not from a can!  During the second visit I had the cranberry salad and it was excellent!  The decor is nice and bright and extremely clean.  The restaurant, while a bit narrow due to the size of the space, feel spacious, and there is definitely room for groups up to about 6 people.  Having lived in this neighborhood for years, I would say that this restaurant is a great new asset to the neighborhood!!!",

        "caption": "Based on my first visit I\u2019d give KOS 3.5 stars, but I\u2019m adding the extra half star for potential.  I, and a dining companion, visited KOS on their grand opening day. I expected balloons, music, food/drink specials, but nope... the atmosphere was one of a typical day in a typical restaurant. The only difference was, people (employees? Owners?) kept asking if we were enjoying our food/experience.  For an appetizer, we ordered the smoked BBQ wings. They were tasty and I was impressed by the amount of wings that we received and their size. I\u2019d order them again. For my entree, I ordered the KOS burger, because it came recommended. Yeah, it\u2019s a good burger, BUT, I felt that it was lacking a proper balance. Perhaps a butter pickle or two, or something else cold... crunchy... I don\u2019t know.  The drinks were, for lack of a better word, forgettable. I ordered a bourbon drink from their mixed drink menu and wasn\u2019t impressed. It was sweet and on the weaker side. My companion also ordered a mixed drink (lemonade?) and I could tell by her reaction that she wasn\u2019t wowed by it. I\u2019d probably skip the mixed drinks unless there was a a happy hour special.  Had I not ordered the KOS burger I was tempted to order their shrimp & grits. When I learned that their S&G didn\u2019t come with a sauce or gravy that was an instant turn off for me.  On my next visit I\u2019ll either go with the Southern Chicken Sandwich or the Chicken and waffles.  I know that I don\u2019t sound thrilled by my first visit, I am looking forward to my second visit and I recommend that you check them out for yourself. KOS provides a welcome touch of originality in the land of quinoa bowls and overpriced coffee.",
