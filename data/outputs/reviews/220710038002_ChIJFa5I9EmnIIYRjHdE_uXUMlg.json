We ordered, got our food in a reasonable time given how busy they were, and it was entirely worth it. I had seafood noodle soup, my wife had shrimp and eggplant, and we shared bao.

How could even the crawfish taste so plain?!  The Pan-fried tiny bao SHOULD have some meat soup in it (even the instant ones I bought from Asia grocery store tasted better after unfrozen), but didn\u2019t.  The Phoenix claws were okay, about average compared to the ones I had in the Chinatown of nyc or chicago (not to mention the authentic ones I had in China).  After being so disappointed by the first three dishes, I totally lost appetite and did not want to try the crabmeat & crawfish Bao. If these turned out to be great, I will update here.  I don\u2019t know how this restaurant got such a high online rating - 4.7 out of 5!!! Given the food I got today, there must be something wrong... could it be they changed the chef temporarily? Or the chef caught COVID (thus lost taste)? Really have no idea.",

Terrific restaurant and very friendly and helpful -if you have to eat gluten free!!!",

Was a little tired of USA food after 2 weeks of driving in the Southern States.  I think this place is very popular with locals, and everyone in the queue would rave about how good it is. As a Chinese who has eaten Chinese food in New York and at home in London, I would say the quality from a purely Chinese perspective is variable.  The steamed \u87f9\u7c89\u5c0f\u7b3c\u5305 were not bad at all and would recommend. The plain rice is American long grain so it's so so. The sea food fried rice was not good. The garlic pea shoots were fine. I can make better hot and sour soup at home. They ran out one night of the stir fried spicy cabbage, so kindly substituted for pea shoots. I was told this dish contains pork, which I thought would have been fine for flavour, but obviously not something you'd find in \u624b\u6495\u5305\u83dc it in fact it contains extremely salty bacon in large pieces. I recognise my dish did not have the intended cabbage, but there is no way that would have been nice either. The bacon made the entire dish salty beyond belief and far too meaty to enjoy. Would have been better without meat altogether. The green beans weren't good and smothered in sweet sauce.  So in summary, I think this place is fine for people who do not know what good Chinese food is and what it's supposed to taste like, but not great for an actual Chinese person. However, if you're craving a change from the usual USA and Cajun fare, I think it's in a great location and it is certainly very edible. I will end on the fact the xiao long bao are pretty good.",

It's a little pricey but then again, there aren't any dumpling restaurants I know of in the area. We ordered Shu Mai, Basil Popcorn chicken, Bok Choy, steamed Pork Bao, Hot & Sour dumpling soup & Xiao Long Bao (Soup dumplings). My favorite was the hot & sour dumpling soup because it had really good flavor. Everything else was okay, the Xiao Long Bao kept tearing apart so the soup would just spill out before I can get it on my plate which was a little disappointing. I may give this place another try because the service was really good compared to some of the food.",

Beef soup noodle reminds me of the 'beef stew noodles' in Kim's Restaurant at Four Columns in Harvey, good. ShuMai (\u71d2\u8ce3) OK.  Egg plant dish and beef dish have similar sauce. Somehow, I forgot to order boiled dumplings which looked steamingly fantastic coming to next tables. Dessert OK.  Will be back.  Line outside waiting to come in was long at 7:45pm on Sunday.",

My wife had a mango smoothie which was delicious. The service was perfect  and the food came out piping hot. The t-shirts the staff wore Had a cute Chinese/New Orleans slogan. \"Who Gao Dat\" and the restaurant logo on the back. I bought one to remember the fine meal. Reasonably priced and you can not go wrong. A great break from the heavy; deep-fried local fare and two blocks from our home.",

And it\u2019s way cheaper. \u592a\u5931\u671b\u4e86\uff0c\u6b63\u5b97\u4e2a\u7403\u554a\u6b63\u5b97\u3002\u4f60\u9a97\u9a97\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\u5c31\u7b97\u4e86\uff0c\u6253\u7740\u6b63\u5b97\u4e2d\u56fd\u83dc\u7684\u5671\u5934\u5356\u7f8e\u5f0f\u4e2d\u9910\u7b97\u51e0\u4e2a\u610f\u601d\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u6302\u7f8a\u5934\u5356\u72d7\u8089\u4e48\uff1f\u867e\u997a\u8ddf\u8d85\u5e02\u91cc\u51b7\u51bb\u5356\u7684\u5473\u9053\u4e00\u6a21\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u8fd8\u5356\u7684\u8fd9\u4e48\u8d35\uff01\u592a\u5783\u573e\u4e86\uff01",

        "caption": "This is the best Chinese restaurant in New Orleans and frankly I could leave it at that but let's dig in. I went on a Sunday afternoon right as they were opening (3pm) with a large group (7). We arrived around 2:40 and there was already a line forming. We were seated right away and the service was attentive but chaotic. We ordered everything at once basically but it came out sporadically. The dishes we got (and my opinion) *Five Spice Fried Pork Ribs - fine, could use more spice to cut through the grease *Salt & Pepper Squid - same as above *Xiao Long Bao - very good *Crabmeat and Crawfish Bao - not as good as the xiao long bao but a really great local take on the dish. Will surely become a restaurant special *Pork and Shrimp Dumplings - whether fried or steamed they had a great flavor, the mince meat was well seasoned. *Sauteed snow pea tips with garlic - have to have something healthy. Pretty good *Stir Friend Noodles in XO Sauce - good. Much better then the takeout lo mein you may be used to *Walnut Shrimp - excellent *Beef Eggplant - showstopper. An absolutely delicious dish - perfectly balanced spice and tender eggplant. I'd come back for this. *Salted Fish Chicken Fried Rice - delicious. Definitely recommend trying something outside your comfort zone.  With the food out of the way let's address the elephant in the room - service. It's not great. You're probably going to have to wait to get a table, you're gonna have to wait to get food and it will arrive randomly. The above described menu probably took over an hour to fully arrive and it did not come in any predictable way. This is pretty much why they lose a star. That being said - they're brand new! I don't even know why people are flocking here. I think once they hire more staff and figure out the kinks that every restaurant has at the beginning they'll be a true 5 star destination. I already can't wait to go back.  I see lot of people referring to it as a dim sum restauraunt and while they serve a lot of dim sum staples don't expect a dim sum like experience - that is bringing a large group and sharing a lot of plates. It's definitely geared towards smaller group dining. The \"mains\" are definitely  individual entrees. I think this would be a great spot to go with 2-4 people and share some appetizers and get individual dishes.  Finally - yes it's in the quarter so don't try to drive here. You won't find parking. Take a streecar/Lyft/Uber/bike or something.",

The pork buns were good as well as the shrimp noodle dish and fried rice. I do NOT recommend szechuan beef dish, unless they fix the recipe- it was way too oily and the beef was soft and flavorless. It reminded me of a cheap strip mall Chinese restaurant dish. Will be back and look forward to sampling other dishes. Staff was friendly and responsive.",

So, this past Saturday my wife and I decided to go give it a try. Traffic was pretty bad and we got there a little later than expected, around 2:15PM. We saw that they close at 3, but there was only a short line with a few people in front of us so we thought maybe we\u2019re okay. Then comes the waiting game. 35 minutes later at 2:50PM, a waitress came out and rudely inform us and the people lining behind us that they would not be able to serve us. So we just waited 35 minutes for nothing. I know they close at 3, but I don\u2019t understand why they waited until literally 10 minutes before the closing time to inform the customers. I mean there are so many things that could\u2019ve been done to avoid this, hiring a hostress, taking numbers, or even using one of those phone apps that send text messages to waiting customers. By doing none of that and just having people lining up until the last minute really shows how much this restaurant cares about their customers. I honestly think they\u2019re taking advantage of customers in line to create some type of hype to draw in more attentions. We will not be revisiting. There are plenty of good Chinese food in New Orleans, and none of them would mistreat their customers like Dian Xin.",
