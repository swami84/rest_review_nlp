I don't normally write reviews and these people didn't ask me to write one but I just felt that it deserves at least a review for their exemplary quality of food as well as the service! The Chicken Qorma was the best I've ever had from an outside place, it had a nice, homely taste. My friends were saying the same about the Biryani and Chicken Boti. The restaurant staff was the most friendly as well, looked like its a family-owned business. Oh yes, and they gave us an extra kheer with the order! Thanks for that! I look forward to ordering a lot more food from here and also dining in!",
