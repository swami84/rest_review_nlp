Heads up - this is NOT a red sauce joint.  I love a chicken parm as much as the next guy and there are plenty of good joints for that in Bay Ridge.  That's not what you're going to get here.   You're going to get excellent regional Sicilian food.  Went here a few weeks ago just the wife and me and had very much enjoyed it.  Came back last night for a big party with family for my birthday.  This place is an exciting addition to Bay Ridge!!  We basically ordered everything on the menu, and everything was delicious.  The caponata was not too sweet or tomato-eyl, the arancini were perfect, the ricotta di pechora, insulate di finocchio and insult verde (pistachios, YO!) ... all were delightful to the palate.  The panel sandwich, muffuletta, sfincione (with and without anchovies) and the pasta al forno.  All very, very good.  Vincent said he carries tripe on occasion, and he'll do a pasta con sarge for St. Joseph's day.  So in advance of the big party I asked him to have an order ready for my dad.  Look - I'm not a big fan of tripe, most aren't, but that's not the point.  The point is Vincent was enthusiastically accommodating and most importantly, serving tripe says a lot about the grit of the restauranteur behind the shop.  Thank you Vincent!  The menu is small but they only just opened before the world ended in March 2020, so give them some time and I'm sure they'll expand.  But it doesn't matter because everything here was excellent.  That carciofi fritti with pesto mayo (trust me, it's delicious) and the pasta al forno are the bee's knees.  The restaurant is charming and proud in a simple way, the food is great, the service is excellent.  Thanks for a wonderful evening, Vincent, and many, many more to come.",

        "caption": "We went to the grand opening where we got to sample the entire menu. This was a great way to promote this new restaurant. Every single thing we tried was excellent! All of the appetizers, paninis, and the cannolis were amazing. I did not expect such great food. This is a small place with a small menu, but worth trying for authentic Italian food! Highly recommend.",

Sfincioni had a great texture, crisp bottom, airy middle, rich sauce, perfect toppings. If you want authentic, make sure to ask for anchovies, they chop them in the sauce as it should be. Super clean also!",
