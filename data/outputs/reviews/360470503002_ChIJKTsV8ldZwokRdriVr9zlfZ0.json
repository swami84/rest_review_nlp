It was just right, the food was so good, limited options but really good nonetheless. The burgers were juicy and the bread was soft which is just the way I like it unlike most burger buns.

A perfect meal for a really cold day. They have turkey burgers too and small tables so you can sit and eat in if you want to.",

I came to eat here with my two friends because I had eaten here in the past and thought it was ok. They had ordered the same dish off the menu and only changed the style of eggs they wanted. When the dishes came, we realized that they gave us the wrong dish. Literally, the dish says it\u2019s called \u201cTurkey Bacon, Eggs, and NY Cheddar\u201d and they gave the two girls two eggs, a salad, and some home fries and charged us for a side of bacon each. I attached a photo of their menu pulled directly from their site. This was the dish on the menu that we ordered and never got.  I brought this up to the server when we said that we shouldn\u2019t be charged for a side of bacon because that\u2019s what\u2019s supposed to come with the dish and that it was a small portion (two scrawny pieces) for the price. She said if we wanted extra, we\u2019d have to talk to a manager.  The chef comes over and says he isn\u2019t the manager (i don\u2019t believe that) and that we were the ones who ordered wrong and that we\u2019d have to pay for everything. We would have been glad to pay for our dishes if they were either replaced or if they accommodated a simple request of a little more bacon to make it even. He walked away and while we were discussing what we should do, I took a bite of the pancakes we ordered and they were RAW. Literally, there was batter and dough oozing out when i cut into them.  I went to the counter to talk to the chef privately because on top of the original issue, we now have pancakes that are inedible. I told him I had been there in the past with no issue and that we just wanted to reach a resolution. He said he has \u201cnever seen me there\u201d and said I was lying. He started telling me that if we didn\u2019t pay for the sides of bacon (THAT WE NEVER ORDERED), the server would have to pay for it. The server also claimed that she confirmed our order with her, but the only confirmation she asked for was the style of eggs. That was it. I think she was scared to go against him because this guy is obviously unhinged.  The chef starts YELLING at me and berating me and when I stood up for myself and matched his volume, he got frustrated because he said *I* was the one causing the scene and that customers were staring. He came to inspect the pancakes and I broke them apart to show him how inedible they were and that\u2019s when he said that we had to leave. He didn\u2019t want anyone else to know that they served us raw pancakes.  Had he accepted that the mistake was the restaurants fault and accommodated our only original request, which was just some extra bacon to make up for the mistake of a wrong order, no scene would have been made. They have no consideration for their patrons - especially the chef. I can\u2019t believe he had the nerve to yell at me in front of other customers and then get mad at me for standing up for myself.  I\u2019m looking forward to eating at any other amazing place on Grand street. I recommend Le Barricou (only one block away) over this place ANY DAY.",

The \"chef\" here seems to enjoy tricking people by purposefully calling things the wrong thing.  The Buttermilk Pancakes?  Yeah, they're made with some strange coarse flour that makes the pancakes harder than hockey pucks.  Hockey pucks probably taste better too, these were just the pinnacle of awful.  It's like someone said, \"I hate people who eat pancakes. So I'm going to make them suffer by designing the worst pancakes a person can imagine.\"  And then somehow they're even worse than that.  Turkey bacon?  Hah.  I don't know what it is, because I love Turkey Bacon and this ain't it.  The stuff they have here is thinner thin single ply toilet paper, greasy and sticky and tastes absolutely wretched.  The place deserves to go out of business for serving something so nasty.  The toast?  I'll just say \"Ugh, skip it\" and leave it at that.  Do you need butter with your toast or pancakes?  Be prepared to explain why you need it because apparently they REALLY don't like giving people butter.  Apparently the \"chef\" decides how much butter you need on things, and finds it offensive if you feel need to add some.  Also be prepared to ask for it several times, each time being questioned again why you need it, because the waitress keeps passive aggressively \"forgetting\" multiple times to bring it.  They also have a Willburg Benedict.  Here they thankfully changed the name to tell you right up front it's not what you expect.  It's also not anything you want.  It's absolutely terrible and disgusting.  There's more of that \"turkey bacon\" here, but pretty much every element of this dish is also terrible.  The water wasn't bad, but even then, it wasn't very cold and it was a hot day out, a nice cold glass of water would have been nice.  But no, not here.  If it's something that might make you enjoy the meal in the slightest, you can bet they have gone out of there way to make sure you don't get it.  The place just fails across the board.  They literally must have practiced and purposefully gone out of their way to make food this awful.  It's also a dump.",
