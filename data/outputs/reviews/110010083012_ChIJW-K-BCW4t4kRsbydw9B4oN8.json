The food was excellent, but I had expected a little more pork. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. We also got appetizers. The currywurst was really nice. It's a weisswurst with curry seasoning & sauce. The pretzels with beer cheese were a little disappointing--the beer cheese was camambert-based, and was too bland for the pretzels, which were also under-salted. Total for the meal for 2 w/ appetizers and 2 extra liters of beer was $182 + tip.  Covid-19 precautions: everyone is required to wear a mask when they aren't eating or drinking. Menus are disposable. Tables indoors are 8-10ft apart, and outdoor tables are around 5-6ft apart. There are also air filters in every room, but I'm not sure those air filters are effective against covid-19.",

Cucumber memories of my grandmother making it, the reset were not to our liking, but very easily could be to others.  The potato pancakes on point. My grandmother use more minced onion, just saying. :)  I consumed all of my Jagerschnitzel, but would have been happy with any of the schnitzels.  The wild boar goulasch was so rich, part of it came home with us. Desserts again the gooseberry a miss with the gelatin like consistency but the pear tart on point.  See you all again soon.",

We literally parked on the street and this gem was across the street so in we went.  The hostess inside was quick to greet us and to see us. Surprisingly this restaurant spans three small buildings there. It is very tight quarters and the bathrooms are quite small but the decor is quaint and elegant and even though everyone sits somewhat close together the decorations and drapes between side table/booths help give you a sense of privacy. The prices were decent, burger was $14, steak sandwich was $20, and bacon omelette was $12(?).  They seem to have a wine cellar up front and their brunch drink prices were good also (Bellini for $8)  I would visit this neat little gem again.",

Although there were only 4 others in our section a small group (of about 8) came into the other section next to us and all attention immediately went there. Despite being seated right next to the door between the two rooms our server dashed by us multiple times but treated us as if we were invisible. We were never even asked how the meal was or if we needed anything else. Needing a new knife the only way we could get one was to take it off the place setting at the table next to us. My wife asked if our server could take a photo but we were told he was too busy and could not. Clearly his only interest was working for the big tip he was hopeful for from the group and our business was unimportant.  Food was ok but nothing special or even really memorable. A different person did take our check quickly...Funny how even when service is subpar they can always take your money quickly and that 'service' element always shines.. In a city with a lot of great dining options this would not be a place I'd recommend or return to. Disappointing.",

Our waitress came to take our drink orders as we were talking about which beer or wine to get and instead of being helpful and recommending drinks, she walked away. Didn't say a word just went to another table. We didn't see her again for 10 minutes! When she finally did come back we ordered drinks and our food for fear she wouldn't come back for another 10 minutes. Our food came out and we all agreed it was good but nothing to keep us coming back. I most definitely enjoyed the German version of cheese cake for dessert...it was very good!",

I can't profess to be an expert on German cuisine, but I'd like to think I can tell when something is made fresh versus from a can or is made using shortcuts.  My girlfriend and I decided to just do appetizers as we had an important dinner later that day. We ordered the mac and cheese, schnitzel, soup, potato dumpling, and potato pancakes.  My favorite was the potato dumpling. Interestingly it had the texture of sticky rice but in potato form and was served in a pool of beef gravy. The gravy was very potent and tasted like stock broth from a jar, but very good!  The pancakes were also good and are basically hash browns (luckily I like hash browns) and served with apple sauce and a pumpkin butter. Never had that combination before but it was extremely tasty.  The other two either lacked flavor (mac and cheese) or were too damn good to be legally sold. But again I could taste the shortcuts and enough of them made me feel a little disappointed.",

We had a reservation at 1:30pm and when we walked in, we were in happy spirits and excited to be there. We walked out frustrated, upset and disrespected after waiting half an hr. When we were greeted, the server was rude and told us \"it will be a while\"....well we had a reservation and why was she being rude to us about our reservation? Then we waited 30 mins where we seemed to be in the way and grumpy servers rushing past. Finally two seats at the bar opened and we seated ourselves. The bartender was not friendly at all and then when we went to order, they had already run out of the suckling pig \"Spanferkel\"...which is the reason we had come.  Not only that but the bartender was SUPER rude, unwelcoming, mean and down right I WILL NEVER visit this establishment again. No reason to be this rude. Especially when I was so excited to eat one of my favorite German meals.",
