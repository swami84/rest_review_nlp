Strayed from my usual two or three spots (Lee\u2019s, Hampton Station, Eddie and Sam\u2019s) because I always drive by and think about checking it out, but I will not be doing that again.  They were fast, but it appeared to be a very slow Tuesday evening for them. I picked up a medium two-topping pizza, small bbq wings and an order of fries for almost $30. The pizza was almost undercooked, very chewy, and just bland. I don\u2019t think I could have told the difference between the dough/crust of this and that of a bagel. The wings and fries were ok, but I mean, how much could you mess that up unless you forgot something or made it wrong completely.  For $30 I could have gotten more (and much better-tasting) food for less at my usual spots. The people were nice enough. But that\u2019s not enough for me to ever stray from my go-tos again. I recommend you do the same.",

I have tried the margarita, pepperoni, and buffalo chicken and like them all. The buffalo chicken in particular is *great*. I order mine well done which brings it to another level for me with the blue cheese they give you with it. Really good refrigerated as well.  They also do a lunch deal, something like 2 slices and a drink for $6-7. They are also open a little later for the area and I find that very convenient.  They're also on the delivery apps if that is your thing.",

This location looked like it had good reviews, but once we got there, it was in a tiny shop and no one was there. (Should have known that was a red flag). We walked in and ordered, since we figured we should try it out, and we were highly disappointed.  The pizza tasted like cardboard and one of the pizzas was burnt on the bottom. Once we started eating the pizza, it was like chewing through bubble gum. The staff informed us that it would take 10 minutes and it took about 25 minutes. The prices were not worth the quality of the food.  We also ordered their tres leche cake and it was terrible! It was stale and hard! Why are you serving stale and hard desserts?  We are never going back to this place and I'll make sure to tell everyone about my experience so they are fully aware of the terrible food.",

I'm not sure why, but I have been craving pizza for two weeks.  I had even participated in Tampa Bay Pizza Week that was held in late March--in search for the best pizza in this area.  The pizza was okay.  I love fresh basil on my pizza because it adds so much flavor.  I hoped the chef here would have put the basil in between the sauce and cheese, but he didn't.  The pizza was good, but it would have tasted better if the basil was underneath the cheese.  I prefer how Cappy's in Seminole Heights makes this pizza.  They know where to place the basil.  I was extremely disappointed with the wings.  I originally wanted lemon pepper wings, but they did not have this option.  So I ordered garlic parmesan.  I hoped the garlic parmesan would have been a dry seasoning rather than wet.  When the woman said it was wet, I said okay---and once I tasted them I was disappointed.  The chef used too much butter and not enough seasoning.  These wings were flavorless.  I could 't even finish it--and I love chicken wings.  Garlic Parmesan should be a dry rub rather than a wet rub.  Customer service was excellent and the prices are reasonable.  I just hope that the chefs read this and modify their recipes.",

The last time the order was late (again), but the worst part was the chicken was like jerkey. It wasn't edible. I even took pictures to show the manager. I called 4 times and politely tried to resolve this saying I didn't understand how that could happen. Having worked in the service industry a replacement pizza should have been provided. At the very least. Iinstead the manager was arrogant and clearly didn't care. Sad because I have ordered from them over 50 times, and believe in supporting local start ups. Will NEVER order again.",

I can only assume it was sitting somewhere forgotten. I ordered the Italian and I have to say the actual pizza was really really good. I bet it would have been fantastic had it arrived fresh and hot.

I asked to speak with the manager and was told the manager was not in. The delivery driver said I would still be expected to pay for a pizza that took 2 hours when originally quoted 40-45 minutes.

(not the first person to leave an undercooked chicken review) First let me state that this is already the single-most inconsistent restaurant in Tampa, with a terrible reputation with many people in Seminole Heights who try to frequent it. I am one. I have continued to give the benefit of the doubt for several years as I've watched them slide downhill with everything from sopping-in-grease empanadas, to undercooked pizza, overcooked pizza, wrong toppings, wrong sizes, NO sauce on wings (several times), gross salads, etc. I finally gave up and just ordered one-topping pizzas from here because \"how bad could you screw up a pizza?\".... until tonight.  I ordered a \"free\" meal (pizza) (with wings that I paid for) to make up for another order that they butchered, just waited an hour for wings (orders normally only take 30 mins tops to get here), and the bones are absolutely bloody. The chicken is not cooked at all. The response when I called, after my father ate one trusting that it was cooked (because what other job does a restaurant have than to cook food), was \"oh I know what happened- the new girl probably mixed up which ones were cooked and which were raw\".  ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What kind of sick joke? Would more attention have been paid if the pizza wasn't free? This is no small whoops, but I guarantee everyone will remain working there, though there are a whole laundry list of issues.  POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS-- If you're looking for pizza that is GOOD, wings that are cooked, and salads that look fresh, please do yourself the favor of going to New York New York in Ybor (they deliver to Seminole Heights) and spare yourself the potential hospital visit. Or Cappy's. Or ABC.",

First of all they said 40 mins and it took a hour and 10mins. Then i took one bite of the pizza and noticed it was not hot it was cold, plus the toppings wasn't even cooked all the way like they put them on right before they took it out...  Pizza was definitely not cooked all the way through, so I had to put it in my oven to heat it back up and cook the toppings. We still ate it cause we were hungry and did not want Papa John's or dominos. Bad first experience",

We found this restaurant while having a drink at Red Star Rock Bar (different review) and the delivery driver dropped off a couple pizzas and sandwiches for the bar staff.   It looked and smelled wonderful.  So we decided to give them a try a few nights later.   At the time they were struggling to keep up with their new-found fame and the delivery took about an hour and a half.  But the pizza was spectacular.  So we gave them a month to staff up.  Then we ordered again.  This time, the delivery took about an hour, and again the pizza was amazing.   Last night, we placed an order online,  and the pizza arrived in about 40 minutes.  Hot, fresh ingredients,  not over sauced, just another wonderful pizza.    Looks like they have fixed their delivery times. So, if you live in the Seminole Heights area, I would highly recommend you try Heights Pizza.  And if you don't live in the delivery area,  swing by one of the local Seminole Heights night spots and have the pizza delivered there....",

Get real. Go up on your prices to meet the minimum if that is how you want to operate. No specials of any kind either. The woman on the phone was friendly enough but this was a waste of time.

        "caption": "My family and I were excited to try Heights Pizza based on reading the reviews on multiple sites and seeing their funny marketing ads on Twitter. When my son and I arrived it smelled like heaven. The employees were very nice. We left excited to eat a cheese, meat lovers and BBQ chicken pizza with their homemade sauce based on how amazing it smelled.However our excitement dimished as soon as we took a bite of the pizza. There was no sauce on any of the  pizzas. The crust on all three pizzas was very dense, stale, rock hard and had no taste. Low quality cheese, peperoni, ham and sausage. However the chicken and sausage on the BBQ Pizza that had no sauce was good but that was it. I have never been so disappointed in a meal before as I was tonight. If you like sauce and crust that has a rise, soft and is chewy then this is so not the place to go. If you like good quality toppings and cheese on your pizzas this is so not your place. Sigh such high hopes for this pizza place but not anymore.",

Emps are freaking awesome, wings with cilantro and lime gorgeous, and I am not a fan of pizza, but I inhaled it!  So good, keep these guys in business! Forget Dominos, Hungry Howies and the others, this is where to go!",
