I LOVED the pot stickers. There is only one other place i know of (in the burbs) that has thick, plump dumplings like these!

There are several greasy carryout places in the area, but nothing is half as delish as this place. They have hands down the best Hot and Sour soup in the city AND the police eat there.

I was joined by my daughter, her boyfriend, his 2-year old daughter and my 10-month old grandson. The food was fine, but I was charged an 18% service fee. I asked the waiter about it but then he started to play dumb. I asked him if the service fee was a tip? Then he said; Yes, yes. There was not enough people with me to automatically tip our party so I had to wonder if it was because of the young children or because I had black people with me. Whatever the reason; even though I have always enjoyed the food here, this time I left with a bad taste in my mouth and won't be coming back.",

I have been a regular take out order customer for the last 3 years owing to Mon Lung\u2019s close proximity to my residence. I always order carry out, & I ordered cashew chicken twice recently, 1st time I got peanuts in my order, 2nd time I called my order in, I mentioned this to Lane, the owner,  he indicated they always have cashews. But when I got this 2nd order home, not only were there no nuts whatsoever, there was not one cashew. When I became skeptical about my favorite, cashew chicken, I decided to change my order this time to Moo Shu  Pork, & when I went to pick up  this order, I told the owner, Lane about these latest order mistakes, expecting some restitution. His response was the worst I have ever heard from a business, quote: \u201cit\u2019s just cashews, there are more important things to be concerned about!\u201d How\u2019s that for arrogance! I have never heard that from a business when a concerned customer mentions their dissatisfaction. There was no apology, nor any offer to  make it right,  free order next time, etc. This guy & his restaurant, need to learn the basics of customer service, 101. Appalling reaction to unfulfilled order! Never again will I return, as there are plenty of Chinese cuisine restaurants in Chicago to choose from.

We ended up getting 3 orders of orange chicken and 1 order of chow fun, 2 egg rolls, and crab rangoon. The egg rolls were particularly soggy and no flavor, the crab rangoon were decent but not memorable in any way, and the orange chicken was the most tasteless container of meat I've ever had in my entire life. We placed our order with more than 30 minutes before they stopped taking orders so theres really no excuse for the lack of effort and heart in this meal. $70 (after a discount) is steep for 4 people to eat Chinese and literally none of us even finished half our meal. I hate having bad experiences, because it ruins hope for other restaurants after leaving such a sour taste (or no taste in this case) in our mouths.",

It's located in a part of Chicago that doesn't really have any Chinese restaurants, so it fills a niche that way. Quality is pretty much what's expected, but the restaurant is clean and takeout is fast with food that stays piping hot. I haven't tried enough to have any strong recommendations, but the Mongolian combo and house special friend rice were great. The downside was the crab rangoon which was a bit soggy and missing that crispyness we all crave. Regardless, I'll visit again when I get that craving and don't want to venture out too far, but I'd rather head down to Chinatown to get my fix.",

The crab Rangoon was a little soggy and the oil used to cook them tasted a different than were used to. The General Tso's chicken was ok. The breading on it is similar to sweet and sour chicken. Different than we're used to, But taste was pretty good. The combination fried rice was our favorite dish of what we ordered. Be aware it is a little spicy, but we enjoyed it. This restaurant has pretty good reviews, so we're thinking we ordered wrong. Might try again and order differently. Overall, not our favorite Chinese place yet.",

So I asked if I could upgrade to a large. That's when the person servicing me in take out. Whom seemed like he already was frustrated about something. Goes you can't just expect us to upgrade to a large. What are we supposed to do? You're going to have to order another small to make a large. It was $8.66 for the small & $11.99 for the large. So I leave & say maybe that person is having a bad day. I don't mind if you're having a bad day. I have them too! I order my usual today, egg rolls saturated in oil. I call & say you always give me great food. What happened? Do you not want my business anymore? So I assume the person I spoke with is the manager. He's extremely offended with my question.

The wonton soup was well seasoned and hot, surprisingly a good ratio between broth and wontons.  The egg rolls were crispy and had a sweet aftertaste; almost as if they were fried in old donut oil. But not spectacular.  The shrimp fried rice was good. It wasn't too greasy but still had a fulfilling amount of shrimp and eggs.  The sesame chicken was ehh. Some of the prices just werent covered with sauce and had become soggy. This can be the result of picking the order up.  Finally the chicken low mein. Worst of the bunch. Misleading title, I think we saw only a few noodles. It was just ehh.  It only took 15 MN minutes to pickup, which is a little concerning because the food was most likely sitting for some time. But at this price point I couldn't care less.  Don't expect anything fancy. If you're expectations are correct you will enjoy the meal, and the 6 hour after meal nap/ coma.",
