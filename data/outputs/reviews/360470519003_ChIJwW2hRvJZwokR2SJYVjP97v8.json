Pizza Pomodoro with prosciutto added was amazing with perfect thickness, bite and crunch in the crust with sourdough flavor lingering in the mouth.

Olive oil cake was delish and another standout. Worth a trip no matter where you are coming from.",

The waitress then let me know she'd burned one slice but still tried to serve me the other burned slice. Additionally, she put the slice into a paper slip right out of the oven which then I requested a small box for as the pizza would melt onto the paper. I politely declined but was met with an awful attitude as if I was the one inconveniencing her. She quickly threw the new slices into the oven, placed them into the paper sleeves after two minutes, and I'm now picking my pizza off of the paper sleeve.  Definitely not the service I expected and hope to have a better experience if I come back.",

Were quoted 20min wait... we were finally given our pizza at 9pm and they forgot our salad. Had to wait another half an hour and finally walked out at 9:30 with our takeout order. Pizza is cold now. We could have gone to another restaurant, had a meal, and been home in the time it took them to prepare our to go order. It was suggested that we order drinks while we wait but an $8 beer comes in a short glass, not even a pint. Every wine is $14 by the glass regardless of the bottle price. This place is over-hyped and offers poor service for the price. You should switch to table service or figure out how to serve your customers in a reasonable timeframe. Because we had to pay up front, we weren\u2019t able to get any discount or withhold tip for the service provided. First time coming to Leo and never coming back.",

The daily options for paninis and Square cut slices are laid out behind glass while salads and whole pies are made to order.  My slices had a wonderful crisp crunch along with just enough chew to feel substantial.  The potato pie was a little underwhelming at the time compared to its more traditional cousins (margarita and meatball, respectively) but 2 days later it's definitely the slice that is standing out to me. The carby, creamy, starchy potatoes married with the tangy sourdough crust to form a truly lovely bite.  The mortadella panini is another truly standout option.  Incredible quality and respect for proportions propel this sandwich to a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Paired with the colored salad,  it makes for a refined but hearty meal.  Nice but small beer selection,  adequate seating.  As for the more formal Grand St. Side,  I'll reserve a review of that for when I return to have the Clam Pie \ud83d\ude01",

I stopped to pick up breakfast and tried their PHENOMENAL cheese and butter sandwich.  I also had an excellent espresso drink, an oat milk latte.  All the other breakfast options looked delicious, and I look forward to a return visit to try them.  Bearing the venerable Bushwick pizza joint Ops' background, the lunch and dinner options are certain to be just as compelling.",
