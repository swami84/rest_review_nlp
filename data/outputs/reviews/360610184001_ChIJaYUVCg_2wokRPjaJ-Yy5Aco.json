I complained once about the chicken cutlet that was put into my salad being burnt. I still paid for the salad but the chicken was burnt and the little guy was seriously not interested in my complaint which i feel was valid because the chicken was burnt. That was a few weeks ago. I went back this evening to get a salad and the little guy says there's no chicken cutlet. While i actually saw that the was chicken cutlet (because i checked the window in the back before i ordered the salad.) To me this just proves either personal profiling or bad service on another level. I like this place I live and work in this neighborhood I will no longer be patronizing this establishment due to the bad service on the little guys part and no action taken by management. As tenant association president of my building I will emplore my neighbors not to patronize an establishment that would profile who they deem not worthy of good service. ... and they're 20 other stores in the neighborhood that appreciates all their patrons, not just the gentrified ones.

But after multiple incidents I've had here it's obvious these guys don't care. Sad really because stores constantly come and go and they are no exception. Tonight I tried to recover a double charge on my CC for a sand which I ordered last week. I showed the clerk the double charge on my card and he told me to come back tomorrow to fix. I told him I don't have time to come back tomorrow and he moved on to the next customer. Mind you I frequent here routinely and as a neighborhood store the level of professionalism is extremely poor. So I had to sit on hold with my bank to rectify the situation. ALSO multiple times I've ordered a burger and fries exact to the description on their menu and the cook(s) leave something off or don't follow directions. I have left tips too and I regret it because they don't care. In fact when you try to talk to them about it they still ask you what you want on your order and will still not get it right. Maybe they can't read the menu, ok fine but then listen to the customer and if you still can't understand it then write it down instead of being rude when I hand it back to you to fix. These guys really need an attitude adjustment, I just can't with this place anymore!",

        "caption": "I work in the area and always get my Smoothie from here and sometimes lunch. I call ahead of time for my order. Very friendly staff and my order is always ready on time! Thank you!--- written 6 months ago and gave them a 5 star rating.  Current review--  I work in the area and sometimes even  after a few disappointments from here. I get a cold turkey sandwich and a smoothie from here for lunch. I ignored it the first few times, but this was the last time I was going to get this repeated service.  I am now changing my 5 star rating to now a 1. The bread roll is hard and dry, very difficult to bite into. The cheddar cheese is dry on the edges and some towards the inside. I asked for extra mayo and barely any mayo. The lettuce is old and color changed. The person I gave the order too, told me they serve medium size smoothies, but I got a small smoothie. If you don't have it , then just say we don't have it. Do not charge me for something and give me something else.  When I called the shop back because I was very upset, the the person who answered the phone said \"what can I do for you then?\".. rude.. I told them I was not going to be coming back to get another sandwich but this is not the way to do service. He said \"ok the next time you come..\" I cut him off and told him I was not going to return again because of repeated disappointments. He said \"ok\".. as if he didn't care....  Very disappointing. Bad customer service.  I will not be coming back to this location. Thank you for the treatment.",
