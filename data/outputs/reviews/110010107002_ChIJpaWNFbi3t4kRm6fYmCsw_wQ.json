The papaya salad was okay, it was not as good as I expected. It did not have tiny crab as the thai papaya salad I used to have. The Mai Thai cocktail was good also. The glass is quite interesting.

I went with a group of friends and at the end of the night I had some food left that I was looking to take home. The servers cleared our plates and once the rest of my group got their food back, I noticed I hadn't yet. I asked Nan for an update; I saw her, with my own eyes, look through tub of stacked plates that needed to be cleaned, grab my plate with the food still in it, put food in a box and hand it to me. She literally went through the trash and handed it back to me! I've spoken about this with the manager William, not sure if she's been fired yet! Definitely ruined my view of the establishment.",

Fried rice was a huge portion, but mostly rice and a few pieces of chicken on top - hardly any vegetables other than a few carrots on top.

As an appetizer their papaya salad is a great choice. It's a fresh, crunchy, little spicy veggie dish that has a lot of flavor. If you don't like spicy food, their ladna is a great choice and is one of my favorites. The broth is so flavorful that Id rather use a spoon than a fork as my main utensil. The portions are great and you'll catch yourself scraping the plate (as I do each time). When I'm craving something spicy, their drunken noodles hits the spot. They add just the right amount of spice (although you can always adjust that), veggies and noodles and is also packed with flavor.",

The perk is, that unlike most Thai restaurants, this place has a solid upscale feel, appropriate for semi formal gatherings with friends, maybe even an informal birthday dinner, or to meet somebody for business.  That said, there is nothing impressive about the food, and it doesn't quite compare to something that you might find at a smaller, more mom and pop place that focuses on food more than atmosphere.  Prices are also considerably higher the most Thai restaurants.  What does hold true here, is it the service is just garbage. You have to hunt your servers down for refills and spice trays, and surprisingly, this is one of the few places that you really have to work to find somebody to give your money to when you're done.  We literally ran late and missed an event because we couldn't find our server to get a check. After 25 minutes of frustration we walked into the back to find our servers having their own meal and relaxing. \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20",

Overall I enjoyed my meal, service was outstanding, and I recommend the Green Curry.  I saw a reviewer say that the price was a little and portions were a little on the small size. I disagree with this statement. The price was reasonable and the portions are as expected when compared to other Thai restaurants that I have eaten at (which is quite a lot).  Our table had the Pad Thai, Green Curry, Crab Rangoon, and Spring Rolls. I had the Green Curry, Crab Rangoon, and Spring Rolls.  I highly recommend the Green Curry. Lots to eat and the flavors are outstanding. The Crab Rangoon and Spring Rolls were both very good. The same dipping sauce came with both and was okay. I prefer the sweet chilli dipping sauce like others but it did the job!  I would recommend this location.",

I had came here for lunch with my coworkers and we received the worst service from our Server named SARAH who ran after us to harass us about why we didn't leave her a bigger tip. What in the WORLD!! Issues I had with her service are as follow: (1) We were placed at the back of the restaurant which was ridiculously hot! It is 102 degrees outside right now and it feels a lot cooler then inside this place. I asked if she could move us to the front because it was a lot more cooler and I was hot and was feeling light heated, she said directly NO there's a fan (3) The fan did NOT work! She did not adjust it or even come back to check if she could fix the fan, she didn't even check if we wanted some water or if our meal was to our liking. Honestly the whole time I felt like it was a Sauna and I was almost at the point of passing out (4) when we received our meals, one of my coworkers was unhappy with the taste of the meal and did not eat it. We ask politely if we could take it off the bill. Sarah was difficult and refuse to take it off the bill. (5) when she finally brought our check and we paid and left. SHE RAN OUT OF THE RESTAURANT AFTER US complaining why we didn't PAY HER MORE TIP!!?? Seriously!! She was not leaving my coworkers and I alone until she got what she wanted. The service was so BAD and you could literally have a heat stroke in there. I am sorry but that is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!",

I got lost at an intersection and asked some strangers where this place was and a lady kindly led me to this somewhat discreet restaurant. The place was pretty busy with a few people outside, some people waiting for takeout, and many tables taken inside, so I was expecting a pretty good meal. The interior is very nice, decorated like an Asian fusion place but a few traditional Thai/SouthEast Asian elements that add a nice touch to the design.  I ordered beef pad-see-ew and thai iced tea. The ice tea was average, it could've been a little sweeter and stronger. I enjoyed my pad see ew, The noodles were nice and thick, the beef was good, they were a little skimpy on Chinese broccoli but generous with eggs and beef. They gave so much I didn't even finish my meal and I was mega-craving Thai!  I really enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere, and recommend this place if you want Thai in DC or if you want to relax with friends and eat a place that's not too expensive.",

That said, prices on all dishes have gone up by ~$2 in the past couple of years, and I've been disappointed at their tendency to take away certain ingredients. My favorite, the pineapple red curry, is now only red curry (last time I was there, the waiter told me he could add some pineapple for yet another $2).

First off the portions are so horribly small. For the portions to be so small, they should defintly step up their food quality. Their muscles are under-cooked, the curry-duck was more of a pineapple-soup with maybe 5 small pieces of duck the size of a nickle. My gf ordered the bankock sea breeze which was a seafood dish. The plate only consisted of 2 small shrimp, 2 scallops, half of 1 softshell-crab served on top of a bunch(and i mean a bunch) of cheap vegetables, with a cup full of rice. Far from what was advertised on the menu. I cannot eat at a restaurant that goes out of their way to portion out your food and still gives u poor quality. and to think we waited almost 45mins for our meal just to get served this crap.. I've had chinese takeout that was better than the crap that i was served at this place last night. PLEASE stay away from this restaurant as there are plenty of other nice restaurants in this area. If i can stop 1 person from going to this dump, i can feel better about my 130 dollar tab",

We had lunch on Saturday and it was the WORST tasting Thai food we ever ate. The \"dumplings\" looked and tasted like bad case of frozen Sui Mai not even heated trough in the microwave (the skins were extremely hot and the filling was still cold). YUK!!!..  The red curry was too watery, not spicy at all and tasteless as can be (probably reheated in microwave too from previous day leftovers). The Duck salad was over salted to the point of uneatable so we stooped eating it after first couple of bites. The service was not much better then the food. After sitting alone in the whole empty restaurant for 10 minutes we had to look for a  waiter to get a check. BTW all of this YUKKY food and service came to about $30 which doesn't look like a good value to us at all, so there is no question we are not returning and not recommending this place to anyone.",
