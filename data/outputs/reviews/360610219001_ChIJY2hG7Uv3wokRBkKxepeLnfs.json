But today I waited 17min for a salad and instead of being apologetic when I went to ask if it was ready I received sass. There were only two people in the shop so there\u2019s no reason it should have taken so long. The coffee is excellent and the food very good (but very $$$). I understand sometimes things are slow but what I can\u2019t take is attitude. When things pick back up and there are more costumers these guys are gonna be in way over their head. Having said that, I\u2019ve  never had that experience here before. Normally everyone really friendly. BUT If you add in attitude from staff it\u2019s definitely not worth the price.",

Dear Mama serves Devocion coffee, which is grown in Colombia and roasted locally in Brooklyn. The flavor profile is pleasant, light, and bright. They also offer a fairly large food menu -- pastries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and more, including several gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. The cafe space itself is extremely large (unusual for NYC coffee shops), making it easy to maintain a safe distance from other customers. With free WiFi and ample table seating, there isn't a better spot for working remotely (during normal times...) in the upper Morningside Heights area. It's a great new(ish) addition to the neighborhood!",
