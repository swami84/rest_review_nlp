I can highly recommend their BBQ pork buns and vanilla custard buns, which are pre-made and ready-to-go, but fresh-tasting. Both are super delicious. The bun part itself is soft and slightly sweet on both. They were $2.75 each, but you can get a trio for $7.50. We will definitely return to try more items off their menu. These are some seriously tasty buns.",
