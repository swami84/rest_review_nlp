When my wife told the waiter that the korma that she ordered was too sweet and she didn't want to eat it, our waiter said \"Kormas are sweet\" and walked away.  Again, we've had a lot of kormas and none of them have ever been sweet. Sure, cashews have a sweetness to them but they don't taste like candy.  Very disappointing.",

My search, thankfully, ends with Pearl.  My first time here was a few months ago and I made the mistake of telling the waitress to make my meal extra spicy. I erroneously assumed that their dishes were served with very little heat and on the bland side (like most places I have been to in Manhattan). Not here! My meal was super spicy, to the point that I could not fully appreciate the various flavors between the appetizer, entree, Masala tea and naan. The water was fabulous though!  Yesterday I went back for my second time and ordered the same dishes I had during my first visit. Everything was delicious! The meal had a good amount of heat and the flavors were nicely balanced all throughout. The portions are generous and I gladly brought home my leftovers. During my first visit, I drank so much water that I did not pay attention to how much of my meal I did not eat, which was quite a bit.  It is worth noting that for both visits, the service was excellent and the bathroom was clean.  I will be back soon, hopefully this time with friends.",
