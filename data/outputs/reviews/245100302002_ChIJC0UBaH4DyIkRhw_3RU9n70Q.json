If it is a Bookmaker's salad the bookmakers must be Ebenezer Scrooge! Where do I start? We ordered the large, assuming that we would want extra goodness. WRONG! The description on Grubhub listed Shrimp, \u2714 Provolone Cheese, \u2714, that's where the description goes far left. Black Olives (3), Green Olives (1), Tomatoes ( 4 very small grape tomatoes), Red Onions (a very small collection of wilted soft onions amounting to about a silver dollar, Pepperoncini (1), Eggs (3 thin slices, not equalling half an egg). I dug through the entire salad to find these meager additions, because I was so surprised. The rest is a container of cheap iceberg lettuce! At $15.25 for each this is a travesty! This is nothing more than a poor subshop salad offering, usually priced around $6-$7. The acclaimed House Dressing (which I paid for exta assuming great taste and flavor) was a bland gritty mess. I went hunting through my fridge for a dressing to salvage this mess... to no avail. This was a total waste of my money, at $43.09, for 2 salads, including $4.39 for delivery, tax and tip, for such a failure, I am disgusted. Sabatino's, with your rich history in this city... you should do better! As my uneatten salad regretfully moves closer to the garbage, I'm still hungry! BTW, delivery was great even with the delay - on the restaurant's side. Don't waste your time or money on this debacle.\ud83d\ude21",

Tables are very close, black duct tape on the seats, stained curtains and fake plants. Still - it's all about the service, the food and the atmosphere ...right?!  Oh yeah the bread - almost as good as the cannolis. One of the best cannolis I've ever had! I've eaten my way through Little Italy, San Francisco and grew up in New York with Little Italy over the bridge. I know good food! Italian cooking contains all the necessary ingredients just like all cooking. The love in the food is what kicks it up a notch - and this place delivers. Hugeee!  Call ahead, plan ahead. Pfffftttt...just take out! -its friggin delicious!  If this review was helpful (or entertaining) give it a thumbs-up",

The waitress showed up at our table wearing the same unflattering style uniform that first caused me to initially ignore the woman who would eventually become my wife of over forty years. Still, it was a welcome relief to find out that I would not need to remember her name. That abominable custom was not foisted upon diners until Nixon finally bamboozled his way into the Whitehouse.  Unfortunately, there was nothing else worth remembering about this long standing fixture of Baltimore's Little Italy. There was lots of red food, but no one dish was so distinct from any other to warrant the different names given to them on the menu. Red chicken, red veal and red shrimp  would have been sufficient descriptions and even the term shrimp might have been an exaggeration. I am sure there were lots of good things about this restaurant, after all it has been around forever, I just can remember any, although I am sure it was not the bread or drinks.",

There are such a variety of places to sit in this home feeling spaced you are seated almost immediately as friendly smiles. Getting to the food.  A few things. To start the food was absolutely amazing!! I would eat it every day if I could.  I wish I could have tried more but for reasons I was unable to. The garlic bread was I would have to say as someone who enjoys food one of the best I have ever had. But what did seem a little odd was how quickly the food came out. But this could have been because it wasn't busy yet. The experience was superb and I hope I am fortunate to go again one day soon. Highly recommend for a special night out for anyone. In addition for people who don't feel safe in the city.  I am one of those people this place have me such a home kind of space I feel right into ease and I hope those reading this will as well.

Gordon Ramsay would Rio this place a new one and my wife and I requested that he do an episode of Kitchen Nightmares here.  When I asked our waitress how our food came out so fast, she lied to my face that their were 9 chefs in the kitchen and they each have their own stations. One of the stations is meatballs. WHAT A LIE! If it were a fresh home-made meatball, then it would take longer than 2 minutes to make. There were maybe 7 tables occupied, so 9 chefs is a flat out lie.

If you don't know anything about Italian food,  these are both baked dishes that should take some time to prepare.  Lasagne should be prepared in bulk and then heated per serving.  This I understand but the food was out within 5 minutes of us placing or order.  -2 The cheese in the manicotti looked like a log,  it was just rolled in the pasta sheet,  not melted in anyway.  The ricotta in thr lasagne looked like old crumbly cottage cheese and the was no flavor to the food.  It was terribly bland.  No garlic at all.  -3 Both of our dishes were smothered in what looked and tasted like it was fresh from a can.  Please note entrees are not served with side salads. -4 This experience cost me $35.",

I haven't been in about 2 years, and the food was still phenomenal back then. I even had my rehearsal dinner here in 2011! But I have no idea what's happened. I ordered my absolute favorite dish tonight, penne with vodka sauce. I have it almost every time I come here. The first time it arrived I could tell immediately that it wasn't vodka sauce, but I gave it a chance. Then, I discovered two random pieces of shrimp so I let the waitress know it was the wrong dish. She came back soon after with what she confirmed was vodka sauce. It was terrible. Basically flavorless red sauce with some cheese mixed in? I have no idea. Not creamy at all. Nothing like any vodka sauce I've ever had. Also, the pasta was beyond overcooked. I could hardly keep it on the fork because it just fell apart from being so soggy, and the sauce had clearly just been poured on top. I had to keep stirring to try and get it to coat the pasta at all. Then later when the waitress came back, she apologized again for the first dish but added, \"I have no idea what that was they gave you...\" which did not inspire confidence! Something has gone wrong here and it's such a shame! I hope they can pull it together.",

The Bookmaker Salad, legendary around here and one of my all time favorite foods, was just not the same.  The dressing was weak and thin and lackingp, and there was a great amount of water at the bottom of the plate.  The Meat Ravioli were just ok, as was the Tortellini with Tortellini Sauce.  I also understand that many of the waitstaff have been there forever, but our waitress just seemed like she was going through the motions.  Not bad service, just maybe time to move on.  Go to Sab\u2019s because it\u2019s a classic, but don\u2019t expect it to be the way it used to be.",

My husband and I went there for lunch today because we saw that they had a really nice deal advertised for their lunch specials. We were seated very quickly and everybody was very nice however when we got our food I immediately felt sick to my stomach after a couple bites. The tortellini was so overdone  that it felt like I was eating something that was already used. The sauce was separated so you could see all the grease. The salad dressing was gritty and the lettuce was brown. My husbands chicken was half frozen and covered in cheese that could have passed as rubber. I will say however, that we were honest about how we felt and they helped us with the price. But we were shocked since all the other reviews on here are so good. We were very sad, it was the worst Italian we\u2019ve ever eaten.",

When we left I mentioned this to the guy at the door. I said we would probably not be back. He got nasty and told us not to come back. That's GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. In the 30+ years that I have been going there I have never complained about anything. Save your money.  If you want better Italian food buy a frozen pizza from the grocery store.

I can see how parking could be problematic but we parallel parked our minivan across the street with no issues.  We went in and it was deceptively large.  It does not look that big from the outside! We were greeted by a very friendly man and seated at a table plenty large enough for the 7 of us.  The waitress, Kitty, greeted us and assured us that this restaurant was VERY kid friendly. She took our order with ultimate patience and we nibbled on the bread and had our drinks.  We ordered the garlic bread appetizers and mozzarella sticks.  Naturally about 5 seconds after she brought the moz sticks, one of the kids spilled soda on them.  Kitty didn't even bat an eye and brought us another plate of mozzarella, insisting that it happens and kids will be kids.  Everything was delicious, but then the food came!  It was all super filling and everything was fantastic! My 3 year old even said \"this is SO GOOD!\" and she just got plain spaghetti! The sauce is made in house and is so yummy!  I had the shrimp parm and it was great! I've never had that before and it was exciting to try! My oldest got the eggplant and veal. It was his first time having veal and I think he's going to be spoiled if he ever tries it somewhere else.  The waitress told us they cut their own beef at the restaurant! So of course it's going to be exceptional.  After lunch, my husband and I were stuffed but the kids meals all came with ice cream cups and we got extra ice cream for the big kids.  Kitty even brought out a little piece of cake with a candle in it for my son.  It was such a special experience for the kids to have authentic Italian food in such a friendly and welcoming environment.  On the way out, the gentleman who sat us said to my toddler \"you can come back for YOUR birthday!\" And she got super excited at that idea.  Maybe we will \ud83d\ude09",

        "caption": "A sad experience and poor reflection of Italian cuisine. I\u2019d be cautious of this restaurant of the little Italy neighborhood in Baltimore. Me and my girlfriend are visiting from out of town and decided to eat here on a recommendation.  The staff was friendly enough, greeting us several times through the doors on the way to our table. Our server seemed a little out of place and was more interested with moving us through our meal at her pace than she was with attending to our needs. The food, though, is what really brought me down. We had as a starter the escargot which was good enough (I think some fresh garlic en-lieu of the canned that they used would be a step in the right direction) and it was just a touch overdone. The mussels bianco however, were to be determinate of the rest of the night. We received well overcooked mussels in what has to be batch prepared white \u2018wine\u2019 sauce, dead old parsley, canned minced garlic, cheap white wine and no other seasoning cooked down into a broth. The flavor was vastly underwhelming and was accompanied by a dead mussel that found its way to our plate.  At this point in the meal me and my partner took a break to decide on whether or not we should move on, or if we should stay. We decided to tough it out, as our friend is usually a reliable food spirit guide and it couldn\u2019t be any worse, right?  Wrong, I felt tentative at best about ordering an entree so I decided to go with a classic and simple dish, the shrimp scampi. What I got was the same broth from the mussels dish under a pile of wet noodles that were clearly pulled from a pot and dropped on the plate, excess water and all. I also had what appeared to me to be frozen butterflied and overdone shrimp. Not the romanticized and delightful meal I had in mind, but rather a different dish altogether, under-seasoned and overcooked. My partners meal the frutti di mare was no better for the weather, this storm of a dish came with one of the most overdone pieces of lobster that I have ever seen, to me it was inedible and I urged my date to send it back, the rest of the seafood on this boat was also overdone, but nowhere near as much as the lobster. The noodles had THE SAME BROTH as the aforementioned scampi and mussels, and they were piled high and swimming in an ocean of it. Both of these dishes were served with stale garlic toast that tasted more of the cooler they\u2019d been slowly dying in than they did of their actual seasonings.  I\u2019m not the type to send food back unless it\u2019s threatening my health (which this wasn\u2019t) and while I feel as if it would have been beneficial to talk with a manager about my poor experience. I simply didn\u2019t have the energy to do so on this visit.  If I could lend some advice to whomever is running the show back there, look for a new chef. A motivated and creative individual could do wonders for a place like yours, but serving people the same exact white wine sauce on three different dishes should be seen for the crime against the food that it is.

The meatballs were good.  The bookmaker salad was pretty decent, but didn't seem to be much beyond the shrimp.  I did not care for the house dressing at all.  It kind of reminded me of a Caesar salad dressing.  The gnocchi was very popular, and looked great, but I didn't try it myself.  Service: Service was excellent.
