        "caption": "For the record, between my girlfriend and I we have ordered food from here many times. This is the first time the order and food have been wrong. Got the order about 10 min late and back into our apartment and realized the order was wrong.  Called the restaurant and spoke to the guy there. He was very apologetic and told me he'd fix it and call me back. He also asked if I had touched the food. I said only to obviously check the order but no I have not touched it. He then asked if I would be able to give it back to the driver. I said I would, but let's be honest, that's odd and I'm pretty sure against health code seeing as how I had already opened the food.  He called back a few minutes later saying new food was on the way and that they had over 50 delivery orders come through and that the delivery driver got confused.  Now well over an hour into the whole process, food is delivered. I specifically ask the delivery driver if the food was freshly made. He says yes.  I open the container to find my falafel over rice, but the falafel balls looked like they were split in half. Almost as if someone had messed with them. I called the restaurant back and asked the same person I've been dealing with if the food was freshly made or if it was just the same food. He assured me it was freshly made and the food was okay. He even made mention that the styrofoam container was stapled shut and the bag was tied. However the problem is that the food was not only lukewarm but missing the extra lettuce, tomatoes, and onion I had paid for. It looked very much like the food was scooped into a new container and pawned off as fresh.  Long story short we all make mistakes. However it is the blatant dishonesty that gets me here. All he would have had to do was admit the delivery driver made a mistake. Remake the food. And be honest about it. Customer service at seamless  said the guy seemed offended that I even questioned  the quality of food and complained. I wasn't looking for anything for free, nor did I want a discount or anything else for that matter. All I wanted was the correct hot food. I would have gladly paid full price for food that was fresh and hot and correct but very very late as opposed to food that was very late and wrong.  I will NEVER order from here again. What a shame. Too bad you can't give zero stars.",
