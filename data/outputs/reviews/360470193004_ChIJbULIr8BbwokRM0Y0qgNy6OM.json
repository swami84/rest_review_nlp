The lady bartender, who also sidelines as the hostess and waitress, was so rude from the moment we entered. We thought we could sit anywhere but was rudely advised to wait to be seated. After waiting 10min she yells to us \"sit there\" and waves her hand at the table with menus on it (6:30pm), it took 30 more minutes for then to take our orders. Noticing 2 other tables get their food before us, I gesture to our male waitress, and he tells us they are short staff and our food would take awhile. We got our food at 8:45pm. Indeed it was delicious (hats off to the Chef), but people came and went (some which arrived after us) and we still had not got our food. No offer to refill our drinks. No check-ins to see if we needed anything else. Then the waiter asked if we are tipping to tell him how much to add it to our bill. Horrible Horrible Service.",

So I went back last night and orderderd pretty the same dishes and was so very upset  that the food was terrible. The oxtail had way to much hot spices and the collard green had hot spices in it also. The fried  tiger shrimp was tasteless and greasy and the macaroni balls were terrible also. The whole meal was such a disappointment.  Whom ever the cook was last night did a terrible job.. please bring back the Chef from December 12th.. $60.00 bill. What a waste of my hard earned money",

There was a party of 8 people at the end of the restaurant and then a party of 4 people siting next to me and my girl friend and her two kids. 1- The table of 8 left because they were waiting so long  and the table of 4 next to us told us that we should leave because they all have been  waiting for over a hour and a half and had not even gotten their appetizer yet. 2- the waiter warned us that before he seated us that there would be a extra long wait for the food.3- my girlfriend ordered rice and peas with ox tail(her rice was hard like it was from the bottom of the pot.4- my food(wrays pasta with shrimp ) tasted like box macaroni  and cheese.  5- the waitress quit on the spot and she left saying Mr.Wray(who was at the bar)to give her a call when he knows how to talk to people.6-The table next to me was asking the manager who was sitting at the bar the whole time to take something off the bill or else they were not paying. he goes\"don't even try it I've had it up to here with even your waitress\", i couldn't believe he said that. so they all left without paying but they tipped the waiter. And he didn't even come over to our table and apologize for the hard overcooked rice and peas. another red flag is if you look on the reviews they have the same comments with just different names. I wished i looked on the reviews before i went to the restaurant. Would have saved  a lot of time and money.",

The same staff (only 2 servers and 2 cooks) that was assigned to the party of 30 were the same staff attending to those at the bar. The manager failed to take responsibility in the lack of man power resulting to a few of us not receiving our entrees.

On top of the slow service, the \"manager/owner\"(not sure exactly since the server was the messenger)  level of unprofessional and unapologetic manner was ludicrous.  He misread the expiration date on a groupon, so took $20 off(as a \"courtesy\") the bill instead of $40.  When I reopened the voucher   larger enough for them to read, he claimed it wasn't the same voucher, and that I'm trying to gimmick him.  Obviously the servers aren't the issue, come from management.  I have never had such an experience.  Bad attitudes don't get you far in  a food service industry.",
