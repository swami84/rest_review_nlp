The food was delicious which made me want to come back and order today while I\u2019m here in class. I simply asked the cashier about the pricing of the chicken philly wrap because the menu dictates a different price than what I was charge.  The cashier was very defensive and combative with her response and making a statement that she\u2019s so glad these classes come in and out. To hear that as a patron made me feel dismissed and as if the agents that are taking classes here in the building are less than the agents that work out of the office. Afterwards I no longer had an appetite for my lunch. She needs customer service training and I will no longer eat here because of her attitude and disrespect.",
