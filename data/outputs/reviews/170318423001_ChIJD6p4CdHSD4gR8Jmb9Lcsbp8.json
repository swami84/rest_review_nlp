They falsely advertised prices that were lower on their site than what I was charged, so I challenged the price of my order. The First Lady I talked to tried to tell me they don\u2019t use the site I was referencing, which is their restaurant site.  They advertise \u201clunch\u201d prices on their full menu on their website and when I called to place my order, they didn\u2019t ask for size preferences so needless to say I was a bit shocked by a $30 price difference.  The women asked for my order back so they can take back the food and make it a small portion since thats the prices that are listed on their site(but not specified).  When I questioned if they were going to throw away the food and complained that my food would be cold by the time I got it home, I  caught them then reheating my order and putting the extra food back to serve to someone else I\u2019d assume. The woman said they weren\u2019t reheating, yet there was steam and flames coming out of the wok and she said they had to use that to reportion. I asked for a refund and the woman ignored me and then handed me the food back.  To add the food was mediocre at best and because of the price debacle, my food was hardly warm. I had the Mongolian beef and the beef looked questionable and all it had was onions and they were loaded with it.  I took one bite and threw it away.  The orange chicken was flavorless and more breading than chicken. The cashew chicken was the only thing that was semi decent.  Stay clear of this place and go to Mon Lung down the street. This place has business practices and horrible customer service.",

So I went in a few minutes before my lunch break with my partner (OFFICERS) and we ended up waiting 45 minutes for fried rice. There are NO COOKS, the lady who takes the money also cooks and the only reason we got our food and got out was because we were talking about getting our money back.

A man told me that they were busy but that a delivery man was near our home with our order. After another 40 minutes without food, we called again. This time the same gentleman told me that they never received our order.  Not receiving our order is one thing - we would have been grumpy and would have reordered or something. Deliberately lying and telling us that our food was near, and keeping us waiting for yet another half hour - that's unacceptable.",

We had LOTS of food, chicken (steamed and fried), soup, etc.  All of it was just what we were looking for.  The only other thing was we ordered online and we had the large order and picked the fried rice ($2more), but it came with steamed rice.  When we called, the girl told us it clearly states that the large comes only with steamed...but it didnt say that online.  For next time, we know.  I guess it didnt charge us, but it shouldnt have allowed us to choose it if it wasnt an option...confusing.",
