The first delivery, I asked to be texted and I would meet the delivery person in the lobby. Last time, I got no text, and the delivery person banged on my door (which had a huge sign that read DO NOT KNOCK ON THE DOOR - text or call me.) The dog barked for 15 minutes and my building's manager was furious for the disturbance late at night.  This time I called the restaurant after placing my order to make sure that the directions were understood. It made no difference.  The delivery appeared 25 minutes after the order time, while Grubhub said 45 minutes to 1 hour. The app did not update for 2 hours for both deliveries, saying it was currently \"being prepared.\"  I asked again to be texted and I would meet in the lobby (directions for the driver on Grubhub.) Today, I even called the restaurant, and spoke to a man who guaranteed that the problem would not be repeated. Today, I got a phone call (not a text) saying they were in front of my door, and why wouldn't I open the door for the delivery. They knocked on the wrong door, once again, ignoring the directions to text and wait in the lobby. This time, the person who the delivery person disturbed is a quiet, elderly person who rightfully didn't answer the door, because they had ordered nothing. They were woken from being asleep, and complained to the building management.  The disturbance from these deliveries endangers my housing. I called the restaurant afterward, and they stated \"we'll take care of it.\" How do you do take care of people *not* knocking on doors *after* the disturbance happens?  The restaurant person was patronizing and dismissive.  I will not order from them again. I was going to just not get deliveries from them, and order for pickup, because the food was good, but the way I was treated on the phone was also unacceptable.  Restaurants go out of business for many reasons. Bad food is usually a factor, but that isn't the case with Giovanni's. What is unacceptable and inexcusable is being ignored when asking for small requests for the specifics of delivery (which would have saved the delivery person time and effort,) and then being dismissed when it doesn't happen and you call about it. I don't patronize establishments who are rude and dismissive to their customers, and neither should you.  You are the customer. Demand respect in order for an establishment to retain your business, and if they will not comply with being respectful to you, there are literally *thousands* of restaurants in NYC that want/need your business, and will treat you with respect to maintain your patronage.",

I decide to wait for the veal. Then the owner or Manager comes out from the back and starts screaming at me saying I ordered wrong. I reminded him of our conversation and the fact that I said veal marsala 3 times and he screams at me some more. I have never ever been screamed at like this. I have made the same order several times before with no issue. It is completely unacceptable that this man screamed at me in front of his other customers. He has lost my business. Never again. Completely unacceptable behavior.",

But I was wrong- I am not a big fan of meatballs in my pasta-so I saw on the menu that they had meat sauce-which I ordered. Needless to say-I got meatballs.They really were not that bad- but it wasn't what I ordered. I felt the bottom of the bag and knew I would have to hurry back to my hotel and eat because it didn't feel hot. I honestly think they just opened a can of sauce and poured it over some microwaved pasta. I almost walked out when the surly men working there didn't even seem to acknowledge that I ordered-I honestly didn't know if I was going to get anything. But I was wrong again, I got about a cup of water in my bag, some luke warm (at best) pasta, some cold bread. Go to Mamas Pizzeria down the street- they seem really nice there and the pizza is pretty good.",
