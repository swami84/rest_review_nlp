It is very unsanitary to just do that and continue doing that  while other customers may have seen him. Overall my expericne was great.

She refused to tell me her name, so I snapped this picture. She then had her friends who were there, throw stuff at me as I was leaving. They have very poor aim and luckily I wasn't hit or I would have called the police. This place is an embarrassment to the chain, and to the neighborhood. I hope this gets addressed very soon.
