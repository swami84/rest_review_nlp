Not crispy or cooked all the way and chicken breast was dry and the breading all fell off.  My husband had a pasta dish and it was delicious.  We also had a banana foster and it was pretty good as well. Overall I gave 3 stars because customer service was excellent \ud83d\udc4c.  Eventhough I didn't like my dish, they tried to make it over and offered me to try something else .  They were polite and professional about the situation.  I would go back to try another dish and recommend,  just not the chicken n waffles.",

Given that the Black Duck Bar is apart of Palace Cafe, they also are taking the pandemic very seriously which is nice. Tables are distanced, staff wears a mask, hand sanitizer all around, and we were asked to wear a mask when walking around the restaurant.  The Black Duck Bar has hundreds of rum to try and a great cocktail list. We had the cocktail of the month and then my wife had the Planters Punch. Excited to go back!",
