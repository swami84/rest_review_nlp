I must admit that I was nervous to try the griot because some places have it sitting out for a while so when it's time to eat it's hard as a brick. Thankfully this was not the case. Everything on my plate was fresh and tender. I left the restaurant with a full belly and wallet (not expensive) so I'll be back for sure.",
