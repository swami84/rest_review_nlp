        "caption": "I made a reservation online for lunch through OpenTable. However, when I arrived, the host sat us OUTSIDE in a covered \"patio\" with heaters in it that were doing an insufficient job of keeping it warm due to the 40 degree weather. Also, it was slightly windy so blasts of cold air were coming through into the \"patio\" - which is really just their parking lot with a temporary tent set up. I asked the host if we could move to an indoor table or at least a table closer to the heaters. He firmly said NO, that we had to stay at our table because that was how they designed the seating due to COVID.  There was nothing stated when making the reservation that said that I could possibly be seated outdoors. If I would have known this, I wouldn't have booked the reservation. With indoor dining now open in Chicago, restaurants can't just assume that you'll be ok freezing your a** off outside eating cold food. Especially if a reservation was made. Moreover, the host(s) have no reason to be so rude and unaccommodating. This would have never been acceptable pre-COVID, and now that things are beginning to return back to normal, it should not be acceptable now. The restaurant had plenty of people seated inside and I would have been more than happy to wait a little longer for one of those indoor tables to free up. But that option was never given.  Finally, the host told me that if I didn't like it that I could just go. So that's what I did. I went to a restaurant just down the street that was VERY accommodating, sat us inside, and gave us amazing personalized service. Zia's - get your act in gear or you're going to lose your business to competitors.",

The good: During COVID, they have TONS of outdoor seating, with plenty of heat lamps to keep you warm. Given the pandemic, the menu is still pretty expansive, including daily specials. The fritto misto was cooked perfectly, with not too much breading on the calamari, shrimp, and scallops. And, the cavatelli was outstanding - the noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was creamy and flavorful. The sausage was spot and and there were generous dollops of ricotta to top it off.  The not-so-good: Service could've been better, we had to ask multiple times to have our water refilled and the check came out after a long wait (luckily we weren't in a rush). The costs overall are also a tad pricey. Luckily the entrees came in huge portions, which help justify that point  Food/drink: 9/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Service: 8/10",

It was freezing in the restaurant and just about everyone had their coats on. In the back of the restaurant there was an event and the noise caused by a substandard microphone systems was awful, and in the front of the bar a singer was crooning love songs. My date and I were sitting in the middle of this torture. The food was yummy and the bus staff was excellent, thus there 1 star in the restaurant.

Highly recommend making a reservation on the weekends for parties bigger than 5 or 6.",

The bruscetta was enough to share but difficult to do because it consisted of layers of toasted country bead with heaping mounds of tomatoes and other expected elements however much of the topping wound up on the table while trying to share portions with others.  I ordered the mailie milanaise which was enourmous...but it was a slice of loin of pork with attached riblet, breaded and fried perfectly but not the pounded pork filet that was advertised on the menu...and then that was oddly buried under a massive pile of arugula salad...which was fresh and crisp but tasted as if it had been dressed with bottled Italian dressing rather than the advertised tarragon sauce...making the pork crust soggy and cold.  Though I adore arugula and all of the elements of the salad I would have preferred it on the side with a simple fresh balsamic and olive oil dressing and the pork with the advertised tarragon sauce next to it rather than under it. Others at the table had similarly smothered dishes which we agreed detracted from rather than enhanced the food.",

When we received the bill there was no discount or comp even though we settled eating what we were served cause I didn't want to wait for them to make something else. If they threw a little compensation at us for the mistake we probably would have went back to try it again. Oh well, many other better places nearby.

The staff was friendly for the most part. For brunch if you buy an entree you can purchase bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's for $12. The mimosas they will bring to you but the Bloody Mary's you have to walk to the bar to get. I got lucky and had the chorizo skillet special of the day with toast. I was good. The people in my party weren't too happy with the chicken and waffles. The chicken was fine but the waffles were thick and hard, tough to cut. It's pricer but I wouldn't mind going there again.",

I\u2019ll start by saying that we came in with a gift card. The reason we had the gift card was because we went to the other Zia\u2019s location with my parents and the service was so terrible that my dad complained to the manager so the manager gave him a $50 gift certificate. So we go in hoping for a better experience at this location, but it was way worse! We got the calamari app which came out quickly and was fine. I ordered the eggplant parm app (it was good) as an entree and my boyfriend got the pasta bolognese, specifying no cheese in the sauce or on top (he\u2019s lactose intolerant) and asked for Italian sausage on top. The dishes got dropped off and we could very clearly see there was cheese mixed in my boyfriends pasta sauce. It also did not look like the sausage was on top but at this point we\u2019re really just concerned about the cheese. When our server stopped by again we told him it looked like there was cheese and he just said \u201cI told them no cheese\u201d. We were trying to show him the cheese in the dish and he walked away when my boyfriend was mid-sentence!! Then he comes back and ask if everything is tasting good, well my boyfriend hadn\u2019t even been able to try his yet because of the cheese. So we politely ask if he can confirm whether it was made with cheese. He disappears for quite a long time, enough time for me to finish my eggplant and believe me I was eating this slowly, and meanwhile my boyfriend hasn\u2019t had a bite to eat. As we inspect the dish further it is very clear that it contains cheese. The restaurant made a mistake, fine, but at least fix it in a timely manner! We were waiting so long I almost went inside to find out what happened. The waiter finally came back and tried to tell us that there was no cheese in it. We told him we can both see the cheese in the dish so my boyfriend cannot eat it. He asks if he would like something different but we declined since at this point the experience was ruined. I started to explain that I had already finished my meal during this time and he walked away when I was in mid sentence again! We ended up leaving the gift card on the table and walking out. My boyfriend had to get dinner somewhere else.",

When the dish came there was no obvious cheese on it, but as I dug my fork in I noticed stringy substance. I then proceeded to ask the waiter to ask the chef to make sure. He then disappeared for about 10 mins, pretty sure he didn't ask. He then came back gave me weird shrug and just walked away.

We sat down and were given warm bread which was nice. Unfortunately it sort of went down hill from here.  Our server was friendly however seemed a little inexperienced (or very new). We had to repeat our drink order a few times before she got it- she seemed confused. Once they arrived, we ordered our food.. 45mins later we still hadn't received it, which seemed like a long time considering how quiet it was. Our server approached us and offered to buy us a drink to compensate for the wait, which was great. Never going to turn down a free glass of wine! Another 5-10mins passed and we finally received our food. The pasta was tasty, but the pizza was stone cold, which was a shame because it was also tasty.  We then ordered desert- vanilla bean gelato and apple galette. Waited another 15-20mins, only for the apple galette to arrive burnt to a crisp and dry.  I had high hopes for this place as the decor is awesome and the food looked good. Maybe we just caught them on a bad night..",

The patio is adorable. Lots of tables too, and nice lighting. The bar area is more causal but there are also a lot of tables. The dining area was super nice, bit brightly lit, but very nice experience.  There was a great selection of wine and beer (a lot of local options, which I love). The food was amazing. Seriously. AMAZING. I had one of the specials, the white fish. There were two fillets, definitely enough to share for two. My boyfriend got one of their regular chicken entrees and it was so good too. Had two pretty large chicken breasts, definitely enough to share.  The one complaint would be our waiter, he had a lot of tables and it wasn\u2019t terrible since we had such a good time, but he was overstretched for sure. Would absolutely go back.  (Sorry for the half eaten food picture, we were starving)",

I think I have heard from almost every person that attended our celebration that they were beyond impressed with the food, the service from the Zia's team, and how stunning the space looked. You can't beat getting this feedback from family who are professional event planners: 'Every time a serving plate was empty a new dish of food appeared instantly, every time my drink was empty I was offered a new one right away, and the staff was unbelievably nice'. Ryan went above and beyond anything we could have imagined to accommodate all of our wishes and truly welcomed us to Zia's as if we were family. I cannot say enough fabulous things about the experience we had on our wedding day, as well as in the months that we spent planning the details. Hats off to Ryan and his team for everything they did for us- truly an unforgettable experience.",
