Big shout outs to Jed and Jade, their service is stellar and they always are welcoming! Jed even went as far as letting me know what places to try when I head to st Pete for a condense this May! The only thing that I would say that drives me nuts is the light above their bar that has been out for nearly 4 months.... owners should really take pride as they have an amazing team but need to take care of their business! They are lucky to have such great team members and I hope all 3 of them will be recognized!",

I had a slice of sweet pea which was really amazing, I also had some Hawaiian Barbecue which was absolutely fantastic.

It is located on a very hidden street, we actually got lost a few times while trying to get there. HA! We picked out our seats, as this is a seat yourself restaurant, and were greeted by our server. Carolina was excellent! She had such a cheery disposition and answered all of our questions about the menu. Our drinks were also very delicious. Overall this place was fantastic. We enjoyed both our food, service, and atmosphere. There was just one flaw that we found. We think that the owner should consider putting a curtain where the kitchen opening is. From where we were sitting, we could hear some not so nice comments being made by one of the chefs. We could hear them discussing a certain order, which we believed to be our own. This is not exactly something you want to hear on your night out. We did not want to bring this up to our server, as we did not want to worry her. The food was delicious and we would consider dining here again, we are just a little hesitant.  -LH",

We came during a week night, you're supposed to seat yourself however a server never came to our table. I had to go to the bar to place our order. The bartender (tall, African Black Guy w/ Locs, he was super nice by the way) said he'd send a server to us. Our server finally came, took the order, the food came out very fast however we never received our beers. My boyfriend went to the bar this time to get out drinks from the bartender. We basically served ourselves that night. The server can back and apologized, saying she put the drink order in but the bartender never received it \ud83e\udd14  My boyfriend goes there a lot and said the same thing happened to him on a previous visit. I'd stick to Take Out or just visit a place that has more attentive servers. Other than than the Pizza was great.",

Needless to say this pizza should not have made it to the table. Parts of the crust were underdone while other parts were burnt. It was a slow Saturday evening and there was 3 other parties in there. Mind you I had my two young children with me. I feel like maybe our pizza was made badly to discourage us from coming back. This place had no high chairs so I got the hint real quickly that they preferred not to be kid friendly.  My waitress was over attentive at the start and then mostly ignored us once our pizza arrived. That was fine by me because she honestly made me very uncomfortable when she hovered initially. I did go ahead and tip her the full 25% because she did bring my food and drinks promptly. Although I had to wave her down for my bill. While the price of the pizza was reasonable for this kind of place, I felt $8 for a bottle of beer was too much.  Maybe it has been too long since I ordered a bottle of beer while out because I typically drink draft.  I was really hoping that I would love this place. I am down in that part of town several times a year for conventions.  The owner wants to talk about my child wandering the restaurant. She spent most of the time on the couch by the door and then wander over to check out an arcade machine shoved up in the corner. There were no customers really besides us in the restaurant and I\u2019m surprised the staff even noticed my daughter go over to the arcade since they were too busy socializing and eating at the bar. The owner only wishes to make it seem like my review should not be taken seriously but his response only further proves the attitude of him and his staff. He doesn\u2019t even say anything to the description of the pizza or the photo of the pizza.",

From the aromatic and savory fresh made meatballs and garlic toast to the melt in your mouth creation of the Cordon Bleu calzone with tender chicken breast married to ham and fresh roma tomatoes all glue together with bleu cheese sauce in a buttery crust this is pure culinary genius. Be prepared to have your tongue do back flips as the Hawaiian BBQ takes you from the heart of downtown Atlanta to the sandy beaches of Waikiki. The staff, with their pleasant demeanor, makes sure your experience is perfectly enjoyable. Thank you for making our dining adventure one we look forward to repeating.",

It is hands down the best honey mustard I've ever had (made in-house, I'm told)! The pizza is delish, and I can't wait to try some of the other menu items because they all look amazing. The vibe is super down-to-earth and the service is impeccable! Our waiter was incredible - super friendly, knowledgable and just fun. And the owner (or manager) couldn't be nicer. I highly recommend this gem!",

We had spotted this charming restaurant the day before which is located not far from the Ferris wheel near the central park in a peaceful and very pleasant area. We finally went there last night July 4, 2015 for dinner. We were able to get a table outside. We are seated in a small, narrow street with no traffic where only a few pedestrians pass by from time to time. Romantic atmosphere par excellence. It seemed quite noisy inside to us but you might like this atmosphere depending on your tastes. We prefer calm in our case and have been delighted at this level. Christy T. was our server and was correct and very kind to us. We stopped our pick on a 12 inch 6 slice supreme pizza at $ 16.95. If you are very hungry, a larger 8 points may be suitable for you. An all dressed and well prepared style pizza that gave us great satisfaction. We invite you to take a look at our photos which will be published soon. The bill was $ 18.31 with tax. The people leaving the restaurant all had good comments and seemed happy with their visit. We recommend the restaurant and the pizza as we cannot speak for the other dishes.  Reviewed July 5, 2015 in Atlanta GA.  (Original) Excellente pizza sant\u00e9 d\u00e9gust\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur.  Exquis !  Nous avions rep\u00e9r\u00e9 ce charmant restaurant la veille qui est situ\u00e9 non loin de la grande roue pr\u00e8s du parc central dans un quartier paisible et fort agr\u00e9able. Nous y sommes finalement all\u00e9s hier soir le 4 juillet 2015 pour y souper. Nous avons pu avoir une table \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur.  Nous sommes assis dans une petite rue \u00e9troite sans circulation automobile o\u00f9 seulement quelques pi\u00e9tons passent pr\u00e8s de nous de temps en temps.  Ambiance romantique par excellence.  \u00c7a nous a sembl\u00e9 pas mal bruyant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur mais cette atmosph\u00e8re pourrait vous plaire tout d\u00e9pendant de vos go\u00fbts.  Nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons le calme dans notre cas et avons \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9s \u00e0 ce niveau. Christy T. \u00e9tait notre serveur et a \u00e9t\u00e9 correct et fort aimable avec nous. Nous avons arr\u00eat\u00e9 notre choix sur une pizza supr\u00eame 12 pouces de 6 pointes \u00e0 $16.95.  Si vous avez tr\u00e8s faim, une plus grande de 8 pointes saurait vous convenir. Une pizza de style toute garnie et bien appr\u00eat\u00e9e qui nous a donn\u00e9 grande satisfaction. Nous vous invitons \u00e0 jeter un \u0153il sur nos photos qui seront publi\u00e9es prochainement. La facture s\u2019\u00e9leva \u00e0 $18.31 avec la taxe. Les gens qui sortaient du restaurant avaient tous de bons commentaires et semblaient satisfaits de leur visite. Nous recommandons le restaurant et la pizza car nous ne pouvons pas parler pour les autres plats.  Avis \u00e9crit le 5 juillet 2015 \u00e0 Atlanta GA.",
