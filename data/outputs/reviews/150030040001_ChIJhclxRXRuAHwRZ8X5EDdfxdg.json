It's VERY rich, as it should be, but oh so good.  The salads are unique and a real treat.  You can tell all the herbs and spices are very fresh and used with a professional hand who knows what he's doing.  Very personable and giving people.

Well the reviews looked great so decided to have a try.  This place is on Pauahi Street which is just off Fort Street Mall. But be sure you don't miss it because chef Robert will serve you up some great food.  I'll post pictures I took of his menu so it will be current effective February 2020. We tried his shrimp etouffee with mashed potatoes and some chicken Gumbo. We also got to sample some bread that they gave us on the house.  My dish was a medium chicken gumbo. The broth of the dish was very rich and spice level was on the low side maybe a 3 of 10. The chicken in here was so tender with nice chunks of sausage as well. Overall this dish was a solid 7 of 10 to me and the best gumbo you can get on the island. Servings available are 8, 10 or 12 bucks. I went for 10 dollar serving and it was enough to fill me up.  My girlfriend had the shrimp etouffee with mashed potatoes. You can also get it with rice. This was our first time trying etouffee and wow! It was so good! That cream sauce was so deep in flavor and mix that in with the oh so tender shrimp and garlic mash and youve got a OMG moment. This dish was a 10 of 10 for us. Now granted, never tried etouffee before but it's hard to imagine much better than this.  Last thing we tried was some focaccia bread that they were nice enough to have us try on the house. The bread was made inhouse and topped with tomatoey paste. Served cold it was delicious! This is usually $2 from their menu, although I'm not sure of the picture I provided is their normal serving size since it was free.  The place itself is very compact with just a couple of tables that are shared seating. I really enjoyed the design of the space as it's decorated with all kinds of things. Even the reclaimed wood that adorns the walls is interesting to look at.  Finally we happened to met chef Robert and his lovely wife who handles the orders. What can I say other than they are both such nice people.  So if you're driving by town and are in the area be sure to drop by. My only regret is not having found this place much earlier!",

I came in with a group of three which meant I could try a couple of new dishes.  Prices are good for the quality of the food and the eclectic flair of an artist and chef who fills the dining room with the smell of incense and his love of the Grateful Dead. The chef's wife runs the counter and they serve each dish as it comes out of the kitchen.  Beef & mushroom stroganoff on macaroni: Big slices of meat cooked in a mushroom sauce served on a bed of macaroni. Perfect if you have big appetite and very filling. ($16)  Creole gumbo: Easily the winner amongst today's dishes because of the amazing flavor. I don't know what he puts in the sauce, but it's magical! ($12)  Baked ziti with vegetables: Although I really enjoyed this dish, but after trying the gumbo, anything that follows is going to have a hard time shining. ($12)  Russian Salad: A variety of grilled and blanched vegetables which is perfect for sharing amongst friends. I order this every time I come here! ($10)  Combo bread: I don't think any visit to SOFFRITO is complete without ordering their freshly baked bread. I don't care if carbs make me fat. This bread is worth the extra cardio. ($1)",
