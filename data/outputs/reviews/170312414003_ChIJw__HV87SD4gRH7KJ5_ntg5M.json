Great prices too! I LOVE their gelato & their shaved ice for when i want something fresh to snack on. Tigersblood is my favorite!!! They recommended it to me the first time i went there when they first opened up. The staff is the best, literally the sweetest people. This is definitely my favorite place to go to when I'm in the neighborhood (which is almost everyday).",

VinnyD's hit the spot.  For starters the owner is quintessential Chicago. Midwestern hospitality combined with Italian American pride, he went above and beyond to help us taste test the best of what he had to offer.  His passion was evident and it clearly parlayed into a quality product.  The gelato and italian ice flavors are all hand picked by the owner and made especially for VinnyD's.  The gelato was flavorful but most importantly the correct texture; smooth and creamy just like in Italy.  The 21+ flavors with Jameson and Fireball were done well and tasted decadent versus like a bad frat boy night out.  My favorite however, were the Italian ices with flecks of fresh fruit seamlessly integrated into every bite.   I look forward to returning for a well priced, well made, well cared for treat!  Thanks VinnyD!",
