The steak sandwich was basically a piece of jerky on a roll. There had to have been a cup of salt used on the sandwich and fries. Fries were undercooked and awful. Even the soda was flat.",

We were staying at the Westin for a horror movie convention. Nourish catered to the convention by giving us a discount on our meal and providing a specialized horror movie themed menu. But that was not all. Every single person that worked there greeted us with warm welcomes and a smile. Since it was just us they made sure to sit us where we would have some privacy and a wonderful view of the city. To top it off our server Walter was fantastic, our drinks were made very well and the food was impressive. So much that we went back the 2nd day to eat there again. Highly recommend giving them a try if you are staying at the Westin of visting the convention center (connected via the sky way)",

The decor is exactly what it was for the previous restaurant and does not remotely convey what one would expect for a contemporary restaurant. The service was lacking and we had to wait multiple times for the server to return to the table. It would have been expected if it were busy, but there were only two other tables that had customers at the time and each had their own server. There were only three of us, but rather than put us at a booth or 4 top, were were placed at two separate 2 tops, which made conversing and sharing the appetizers quite difficult. The food was nothing I'd ever want to order again. I had gotten a burger that was ordered medium rare, and it came rare to rare/blue and was a complete salt bomb. There was not enough water on the table to take away the burn caused by the overpowering salt content. The steak fries accompanying the burger were just the opposite in seasoning, but were the same in the fact they were quite undercooked. The egg that was added to the burger was also well overcooked. The other dishes ordered at the table were just as poor from what was described from the ones who ordered them.",

It was excellent, the burger was one of the best Ive ever had, it was lean but very tender. Salad wedge had generous portions of real blue cheese, and the calamari was cooked with a crisp crunchy outer layer while juicy inside.  When it came time for the bill the manager said \u201cdon\u2019t worry we got it\u201d due to it taking so long, I never expect fast service when I go to a nicer restaurant in fact I prefer to wait longer so the fact they didn\u2019t charge me was extremely classy.",

The busboy was amazing and attentive, but besides the bread they give their customers, this restaurants lacks in food, service and management, maybe it is b/c I am from New York and we have higher standards but i literally spent 5-10 minutes talking to the waiter, ensuring that my meal had no bacon in it. When my food came out it had bacon. Not only did he take my order wrong but it took forever to get our check and when we confronted him about our order being wrong he had no response. We literally had to tell the busboy we wanted our check to get the attention of the waiter, bc the waiter barely stopped by our table, another reason we waited to the end to tell him about the food order being wrong. He got his manager and this guy was an useless as the waiter. Horrible service and a horrible experience. Please read this review and eat somewhere else.",

I had to use my cell phone light so that I could check to make sure the steak was cook properly because it was so dark.

That night was the best steak I ever ate.  Ever!  And I raise beef.  But Indys downtown inside the Westin is terrible!  My wife had the French onion soup and it was amazing.  I got the thick cut bacon as an app and it was very good. But our steak was terrible.  I originally ordered a 48 oz porter house which we were sharing.  We asked for medium well. Then I remembered that when we were in Florida our waiter suggested we get 2-24s inside of the 48 since we wanted it med-well.  So when our server came back to say it would take 45 minutes to cook our steak we said that's fine but we could switch our order to 2 24s she said oh I've already put it in it will be fine.....  Fast forward close to an hour later we get our steak.  They cut each side off the bone.  My wife took the filet part and it wasn't terrible  but no near the quality someone would expect from a $90 steak.  My strip side was terrible.  It was well past well done.  It was basically a roast that had been cooked way to long and with absolutely no seasoning..   Just terrible!! I am not a person who complains about my food. I deal with the public and I understand.  But after sleeping on it.  Never again will I eat at the Indianapolis Shula's!!!",

I will first say that the wait staff was fantastic. My 10yr old was being picky, and our waitress was very accommodating. We ordered a New York Strip with peppercorn sauce, an 8oz Filet, BBQ Shrimp, Crab Mac & Cheese, and creamed spinach. Of all of those items, I would say that the Strip steak was really the only decent thing, with zero help from the peppercorn sauce that resemble/ tasted brown gravy with a few peppercorns thrown in. That said, I can get a New York strip like this at Outback. All of the food was kind of bland. The Mac & Cheese needed salt and pepper, the creamed spinach was not creamy at all, and the bbq shrimp sauce was terrible. Overwhelming the flavor of the shrimp and bacon. If I didn't know there was bacon on the shrimp, I would have been able to tell by taste alone. And my Wife's Filet... I will be the first to admit that I am not a fan of Filet to begin with, but her \"medium\" filet was more like medium well, and dry, and under seasoned. Since she is a person who will generally not send food back because she feels bad, she got to eat a $43 piece of leather. I would not go back to this location again.",

My 12oz Filet was cold, served on a cold plate and had a weird taste that was not necessarily aged. The b\u00e9arnaise sauce was cold as well and tasted like from a can. Mushrooms  were simply cut up champignons. Despite of the very friendly service , the food certainly needs to improve for the price paid.

When my meal came I was not at the table and my steak was well done, I asked for Medium Rare. My friend sitting next to me, her steak was rare and she couldn't eat most of it. We ordered different steaks so we couldn't even trade. I sent my meal back and they brought me the correct one after the rest of my table had already eaten. I ended up eating the rare parts of my friends steak that she didn't want. We've been to Shulas in different cities and this visit was not enjoyable at all. I don't get to eat out often at fancy restaurants so, when I do I expect the service to be better. The food tasted good and the people were very nice.

He replied: yeah but you have to pay. his answer was polite. but I was shocked that he went to the hostesses and joked about it loud and they started to laugh. I called him: did you just joked about me. He answered: would you like another beer. I replied: call your manager. The manager came and started apologizing, she was nice and dealt with with the situation very nicely. and offered me to have my meal on the house. I refused the offer and asked for my check. without eating my burger.  I'm sorry Shula's I can't stay in a place where I have to pay to make jokes of me.  I don't know any of the staff's names, but you can check the staff in the shift. I just left from there and right now it's Sept 9 2014, 7:00pm",

All of the service staff were friendly, courteous, and helpful.  We were made to feel special with what felt like personal service.  Our filets were perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I highly recommend the roasted corn side dish and the creme brulee trio for dessert.  As we were celebrating my wife's birthday, our service staff wished her a happy day and presented her with a small box of truffles as a \"parting gift\".  We had a most enjoyable evening and would definitely go back.",
