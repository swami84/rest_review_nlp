I ordered the breakfast sandwich and what was delivered was a bland hamburger bun with a side of wilted arugula (see photo). The funny thing is it took 45 minutes to deliver this delicacy. \ud83e\udd22 all three items ordered were awful and extremely bland and we were never asked for refills or checked on for anything. The funny this is that this meal was the price expected of Waldorf but I would have done way better to go to the local Waffle House. You guys can do better.",

        "caption": "Unfortunately, this establishment had the worst service I have experienced in my 6+ years living in New Orleans.  My fiance and I made a 6 o'clock reservation for to enjoy the \"pre-theater\" menu advertised, as we were to attend a 7:30PM show at the Orpheum Theater across the street. I arrived 10 minutes early, and my fiance was 4 minutes late. The hostess explained that I had apparently reserved a table for 4 instead of 2. I checked my e-mail confirmation of the reservation, which clearly stated \"table for 2.\" I informed the hostess of this and showed her the reservation. Despite this error not being my fault, I was still made to feel as if I had in some way inconvenienced the hostess and there was a delay in seating us, despite there being several open tables.  We explained to the host and hostess that we were to attend the 7:30 show and were here for the pre-theater meal. Despite this, we waited 20 minutes before having to get up from our table and let the wait staff and hostess know that we had not even been greeted by a server. It was only after this that we were served water. Bread was not provided for our table until we specifically asked, about 1 half hour after being seated.  I asked to speak to a manager, but one never came. After we finally ordered, the food came out relatively quickly and all at once. The crispy duck was not crispy. We could not enjoy our meal, as we were rushing to finish and were frustrated by the poor, inattentive service. When we were finished eating, we stacked our plates and silverware neatly on the table to indicate that we were finished, and again, we waited. We ended up standing up at our table and looking around for someone to ask for our check. Dessert was not served, as we had to leave for the show, even though there would have been time to eat it. What was supposed to be a romantic dinner was definitively ruined, and unfortunately overshadowed our concert experience as well.  Our bill was reduced significantly, however, the night was still ruined. I hope that this isn't the status quo at this establishment, because I had high expectations and my experience here has left me angered and disappointed. If you're planning to attend a show at the Orpheum, consider eating somewhere else beforehand.",

Now for the only good news; the atmosphere was pretty nice to look at and the server was great...the end of the good news. Now take a journey with me as I break down why I started with a 5 star rating to a 1 star.  As I stated previously the atmosphere is lovely, I do have a minor gripe about the tables being too long for two people to talk to each other. I know it sounds petty but trust me you will notice it.  On to more serious matters; the place is expensive. Google has it listed as a \"$$\" it really should be a \"$$$\" listing. Don't get me wrong, if a place can back up its price I'm all for it but unfortunately they failed to justify their steep prices. Starting with the bread which was extremely crunchy and difficult to consume. Followed by brussel sprouts that were deep fried which I have to problem with. Where they lost me at was how it tasted so greasy as if they left it sitting in grease too long. Not to mention the fact that it wasn't remotely crunchy even though it was deep fried. I literally could see the grease harden and turn white as it cooled down. It was also incredibly bland and desperately needed salt.  The dinner faired no better. We ordered two seafood entrees. Well we found out where all the salt was missing from the brussel sprouts. Both dishes were so salty that it literally...no kidding...started to burn our mouths. For some reason I felt bad and didn't want to tell our server that the main course was bad too so I powered through and regretted it greatly.  The experience was so bad that we went somewhere else just to cleanse our palate. I wasn't planning to drink that night but it was so bad I decided to have a drink. I should have known it wasn't a good place when it was so eerily empty and the restaurant right next to it was packed.  I'm a pretty nice guy. Fairly lenient and forgiving but I can't look past all the faults of this place and give it more than one star. Bar far the worst place I've eaten and my longest review. Please, for your own sake and the sake of your loved ones stay away. Feel free to take an enemy though.",

The service was not good at all and although there were only maybe four tables occupied in the entire restaurant we still had to wait a very long time for everything and I finally had to flag someone else down just to pay our bill!! I had ordered the eggs Benedict and it was awful! The Hollandaise sauce was way too lemony and it was almost curdled and the english muffin was dry and stale,and the eggs were not done and the white was runny! Instead of the sweet potato hash, I got a side of grits and they were flavorless and way too runny! My husband got the eggs your way and they scrambled and not done and also had no flavor. We were very disappointed in the quality of food, and yet we were charge an extraordinary amount for food we couldn't eat! The server could not have cared less about our complaints! Please avoid this place. I don't often leave bad reviews, but felt this needed to be posted.",

        "caption": "I usually do not write bad reviews unless the experience was warrants it. I heard about this place from a friend who raved about how great the chicken was, how hot the chicken was, and how great the experience was for them. So i decided that I would venture there first Monday I had a chance to.Based on what I was told I had very high expectations and never once thought my experience would be any less than superb. Needless to say and judging by the rating, that was not the case.  And I'll just cut to the chase with it. Dinner is from 5-9pm here. So we arrived about 7:30-ish. Only thing on the menu on Mondays is Chef Carl's fried Chicken and that's exactly what I wanted. I should have taken pictures since seeing is believing. When the chicken and biscuits arrived, the chicken was dark (looked as though it had been sitting under the light after thinking about it later) and the biscuits were a dark brown, which I didn't really mind. Normally, I would send food back immediately, but I thought this must be the way its supposed to be. Moreover, the chicken was lukewarm, at best and the biscuits were hard and dry. Moments after the beans and coleslaw arrived. They were the stars of the night. The chicken was a mix of salty, spicy, and flavorless (besides cayenne pepper). it probably won't have been so bad if the chicken was at least hot. Hot food always tastes better than lukewarm of cold food. Amen!  My disappointment was heightened when I observed the tables surrounding me receive fresh golden brown chicken and oh my god, freshly baked beautifully buttered biscuits. This prompted me to ask if I could get another biscuit and man when I did, it was a totally different experience. That one biscuit almost changed my life. It was so soft and delicious (so THEY DO EXISTS) I almost ordered a whole other basket of chicken in hopes of an all together different experience. but I resisted because that would have been a risk that only cost me more money. And for the record, I asked my waitress about the chicken and expressed my displeasure and she pretty much shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I felt halfway ignored. to top it all off the beer that you get with your food (which we both ordered the Amber) was FLAT.  Summary: My experience was void of golden brown, piping hot chicken and biscuit. Chicken was salty and had too much cayenne pepper with little evidence of other seasonings.  The bright spots about this place were the sides(red beans and coleslaw) live music and the AMBIANCE.",
