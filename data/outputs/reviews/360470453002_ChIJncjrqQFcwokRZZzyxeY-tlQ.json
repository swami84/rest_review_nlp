Although I was more interested in the dishes on the dinner menu, I had to say all the brunch dishes exceeded my expectation! The burrata was such a pleasant and artistic dish, sweet, savory, tart, creamy and also starchy. The profile is so complex and sophisticated to make every single bite enjoyable. The beef hash presented lots of Asian flavors, from the ingredients to the spice. I like that the beef was cooked with kabocha squash. The potato pancake at the bottom was crispy outside and leveled up with the tomato sauce. You would think the mushroom was the spotlight of the wild mushroom toast, but it would not be that splendid without the smashed and flavored avocado in between and the grated grana panado on top. I wish the warm weather can last a bit longer or indoor dining opened up so I can go back to have dinner. I heard the dinner menu is calling me back!",

My friend and I sat at the beautiful, long bar and I stared at the wall full of spirits -- a vast selection of pretty much everything! The space is airy and open, in a warm, inviting room. The atmosphere is vibrant and fun. Service was excellent, prompt and a team effort. We felt very well taken care of. We ordered the beets, burrata and the market fish. The food came out quickly and the flavors in each dish were fantastic! I sipped on the perfect rum cocktail, Hawley Atcha Boy - Doctor Bird Rum, Plantation O.F.T.D., Overproof Rum, Avua Cacha\u00e7a, toasted coconut, ginger, pineapple, lime, basil oil. We finished our meal and split the espresso martini. Not the typical drink for me, but this espresso martini was extremely delicious and the cold brew was strong! This drink satisfied our sweet tooth craving! We had no expectations before our first visit, but it was such a stellar experience, when we left we were already talking about going back. Pretty much a fan of Otis and suggest it to everyone!!",

I love the decro with expose wall and just the right amount of lighting. We had a romantic dinner while our waiter only drop by a few time to make sure we have the water. Most people I saw are single diners at the bar and that is the best spot.  They have a happy hour bar only special. With a few dollar off, you can get mussel and a drink. Menu is pretty decent but ends around 7pm.  Our food is amazing. We had the bread spread due to overwhelmed recommendation on other yelp reviews along with another dish. I went with the lamb for entree and it exploded in my mouth. I think it's probably better or comparable with all the high end spots. Well this place should be rated even higher if possible.  This is definitely a spot to impress.",

They serve the cheapest meal of the day at ridiculous prices and rarely offer up anything unique, let alone salt their food. This place stood out. I ordered beef hash with acorn squash. This wasn't undercook potato cubes mixed with tool little beef. This was a generous portion of flavorful brisket served on top of a beautiful and crispy r\u00f6sti (think of it as a hash brown pancake). They hit all the right notes; the textures of the beef and potatoes, the savory brisket, the sweet and acidic puree of the fruity sauce, and the pure spirit of fall the acorn squash adds both in flavor and visually. Every staff member was incredibly cheerful and inviting, and the interior was stylish without being uninviting. I definitely recommend this as one of the few brunch places I felt met my expectations.",

A picky crowd was happy from appetizer (burrata....you gotta) to main course (the entire table dipped garlic bread into mussel broth) and dessert (we brought that from home...they didn't charge a plating fee---even served us ice cream). The service was kind. The food was great. The prices were agreeable. Go on a date, a special occasion, or just to treat yourself. Highly recommend.",

The space has a very nice mid-century modern rustic/industrial feel to it, with skylights to fill the back seating area with a light and airy atmosphere. I've only been for brunch so far, but it was very good, though sitting at the kitchen counter makes you regret whatever you order because every other order you see being plated looks so enticing.

Everything was superlative.  The burrata (with pesto, tomato jam, and sweet potato), beet salad (with whipped ricotta, candied hazlenuts), lamb chops, duck leg, homemade foccacia were each one of the best examples of those dishes that I\u2019ve ever tried in the US or Europe.  We\u2019re heading back to Otis this weekend for a second visit.  Otis marries the quality and refinement of a Michelin-starred restaurant with generous quantities ideal for sharing, a laid-back, family vibe, beyond fair pricing, an awesome industrial chic decor, and just really great juju.  So glad that we found Scott, Paul, and this entire talented and caring team.",

Food was flavorful AF, tasted all the elements in the dishes. I went with a group of 3, it\u2019s worth any wait time. We had the breads and spreads, beet with ricotta salad, trout, lamb shank, duck confit, and berry crumble. Staff was knowledgeable and accommodating. Lauren was our server, she\u2019s amazing!",

The service was friendly and comfortable from the minute we entered the restaurant. We tried all of the specialty drinks except the Bastille Bagel :( (they were out). The drinks were delicious and fun. There is a good mix to appeal to different tastes.  We shared plates so we could each enjoy all of the dishes. We ordered A LOT of food. The server talked us out of a couple of dishes because we clearly over ordered. I am not exaggerating, EVERY DISH WAS DELICIOUS. It was tough to pick favourites. We tried all of the appetizers and most of the entrees. The buratta was a group favourite. The roasted beets and charred cauliflower were my personal favorites. Of the entrees, the shell fish lovers raved about about the mussels (some of us aren't fans but couldn't resist the sauce for dipping).   We couldn't get enough of the homemade bread. I LOVED the short ribs. The duck and pork shoulder pasta were faves of others.  Do yourself a favour and go with a group so you can experience as many dishes as possible and make sure to order the desserts - they were the perfect ending. There are only two so you don't have to wrestle with decisions. Our meal was a religious experience. We will be back on our next visit to NYC. Thank you Otis!",

Let's try this place OTIS he says it looks good . . .uhmmm  . . .he has never steered us wrong and has such a good compass for great places . . . so we change course with zero regrets.  What an A-Mazing find.  The ambience was grand and cosy with a huge well stocked bar with amazing cocktails and the coolest nicest staff you have ever met. We were seated at the chef's table - where you see all the majic happen - and what majic it is!  Everything we ordered was scrumptious from the corn soup, the BURRATA with sweet potato puree and tomato jam and a pesto so gooooood, to the succulent mussels and tender lambchops. Did I mention they make their own bread which they toast on the grill and was the perfect vehicle to soak up everything from the creamy burrata to the mussel sauce. The food was so well balanced, flavorful and had the perfect char from the grill. While I generally like my food more assertive - everything we ate far exceeded every taste and texture expectation and I would not change a single thing.  Last thing, the portions are really big and the food is very reasonably priced. . . and if you have room (or even if you don't) do yourself a favor and have the dessert anyway. The death by chocolate (brownie bites with chocolate gelato and salted caramel sauce and toasted almonds ohhh and fresh cherries . . . OMG) was the perfect ending to the perfect date night.  Thank you to my perfect Hubby and OTIS for a memorable experience. Charlie, Chef Paul and Chef/ Owner Scott - we WILL be back!",

Your response is appreciated and I'm not trying to be unreasonable but you expect some value for the prices that are paid, especially when there is such competition in the area.

The dishes are plated beautifully, very instagramable, if that's your thing. The staff are friendly and fun. I was treated like an old friend. Service was wonderful. The prices were wonderful.The ambiance and decor are spectacular! This place is really gorgeous inside. The location in Bushwick is fun and quite convenient as it is just a half block walk from the Morgan stop on L line. Just GO!",
