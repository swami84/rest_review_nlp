The cheeseburger is good quality meat with a nice bun and came with fries.  The Santa Fe Panini was fine and came with the choice of salad or fries.  Given the freshness of the food and the fact that sandwiches come with a side, the items are reasonably priced. The carrot cake is very good; we expected the usual version that many delis get from some central baker, but the cake was moist and the frosting was lighter than the usual cream cheese one- it may have whipped cream in it. My only quibble is that the menu is very large and that is usually a sign that a restaurant has to use a lot of frozen food to keep up.  I would rather see them pare down the menu to the things that they do well and ditch items (like the panini) that our other, more traditional corner deli does better.  Despite that reservation, the cafe is a nice addition to the neighborhood.",
