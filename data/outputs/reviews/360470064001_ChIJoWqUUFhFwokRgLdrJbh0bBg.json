I'm from the Caribbean so my standards for flavorful food that tastes like someone put their soul into it is pretty high! I'll keep it short; every single item I tasted was beyond delicious and abundantly seasoned to perfection. Cocktails were above expectations; unique flavors of martinis with very generous pours of alcohol. Service was extremely attentive and we never had to chase down our servers. Our table was consistently cleaned off. The zaatar chips; amazing, and I placed an order of it to go so I could eat my leftover hummus the next day. Knafeh was scrumptious! This is definitely my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn!!!",

I\u2019ll definitely have to come back with my vegan friends. All the people who work there are very nice and accommodating as well. It is a bit on the pricier side, but I guess that\u2019s because of all their recognition- most recently being the Michelin Star 2020. Overall, great spot to go.",

Must get the Mahammara, it is a roasted red pepper dip with walnuts and man oh man!! Then we got the combo mix. The main dish tasted amazing. Although i was disappointed by the size of the \u201cshish Kabab\u201d but the taste made it up for it. The plate comes with rice and salad. What we ordered was filling for two people. Also, they serve alcohol there so that is a plus for some people :)",

The best way to order is to get a little bit of everything family style, that way you can try it all! (Next time I have to make sure our whole group is vegetarian so we can order more hehe)  Everything is fresh and homemade. Ordered the vegetarian platter with a mix of things. Grape leaves were sooooo sooo good. Side of falafel, hummus and baba ghanouge. Like my mouth is still salivating from all the goodness. Wish this place was closer to me so I could be here every day.

Upon entry at 4pm with no reservation on a Sunday to an empty restaurant the host kindly says \"since you don't have a reservation, we would just need you out by 6pm\", literally the first thing we hear when we come in. Negative experience upon entry. Service was satisfactory, until I asked if the feta salad was fresh. The Tomatoes tasted like the salad was prepared the day before, soggy and oversaturated in vinegar. Server said it had just been made and took the salad away. Few minutes later, older lady perhaps owner/manager came out and said there's no way the salad is old it just happened to be something we didn't enjoy. I kindly explained to her I eat this cuisine often and know when the salad may be old. She replies she did notice they were overly ripe and should have been in a soup instead of a salad and said she fixed the issue. I ordered another salad, same issue. I haven't been to the place in a few years, boy has it gone backwards. Much better Mediterranean food out there. Sad experience overall.",

I am middle eastern and I know what middle eastern food is and I definitely had better experiences in North America. The food presentation is outdated , too much green sprinkles on the plates that do not add to the taste nor to the visual food experience.  We ordered the mouhamara, pastry plate, fetti chicken and the grill combo.  The mouhamara was very watered down, no strong red bell peppers taste or pomegranate sauce.  The pastry was not made fresh, it was simply heated.  The fetti was the most edible of the dishes but it was too much rice not enough yogurt.  The grill combo was dry and not appealing, it looked like a mess on a plate.  The service was good, attentive and respectful.",

This was my first time dining at Tanoreen. I was with friends. One friend had previously dined at Tanoreen and raved about it...I must tell you that I have had some middle eastern food in the past but I must say NOTHING like the food I had from Tanoreen. EVERYTHING we ate was DELICIOUS....when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING! We could hardly breathe when we left. I want to share with you that it felt like \"Home\". First, everyone we interacted with was most kind and gracious especially Jumana who is the daughter of Rawia and Rawia is behind all the deliciousness you will taste. Jumana was wonderful and so appreciative of the feed back I gave her about the food. I told her there was a familiarness about the food like a \"Home\" feeling as if mom made it... and mom did make it! Please go see and taste for yourself. I will only suggest that you make a reservation. I gets quite packed quickly. Save yourself some aggravation and use the valet service too. Parking is a little challenging but I PROMISE it will be ALL WORTH IT!",

The variety, quality, and heavenly taste of every item on the menu is phenomenal. There is an excellent wine list and they have their own quite creative cocktails.  The staff is very professional and attend to your every need. The owner and Chef usually comes out to greet you and make sure you are happy with the food. Her two cook books are a treasure trove. We've bought them and have been learning from the recipes. Tanoreen is my favorite restaurant. My wife and I go there whenever we can. We are lucky to have it in the city!",

Although small, the restaurant is attractive, beautifully decorated and the atmosphere is sophisticated but, at the same time, almost homey. Tanoreen offers a very pleasant dining experience and is a good choice for a date night. Prices, too, are reasonable for the quality, though certainly not cheap. We had stuffed grape leaves for appetizer, lamb kebob and baked kibbi. The servings were not small, 1 appetizer was enough for two. Dessert, in the highly unlikely event you have room, is worth trying. I had the harissa, and I was not disappointed. What a delicious bite!",

The food is top notch and comes in generous portions. You will not leave hungry. The menu is a mixture of more classic dishes and dishes with a more contemporary twist to it. I wholeheartedly recommend the quinoa stuffed squash. Which also brings me to the fact this place is quite vegetarian friendly. Alcoholic drinks are available and they have some interesting cocktails and Middle Eastern beers. Also the proprietor walks around too see if you are enjoying your meal and if you buy one of her cookbooks, which are absolutely lovely, she is more than happy to sign it for you.",

I couldn't even finish them!  Second, the main dishes. I ordered the stuffed cabbage and the yogurt zucchini. I was disappointed. The stuffed cabbage was not cooked good and only cooked with lemon! The other dish was soggy and tasteless!! I'm an Arab, so when I say the food wasn't good, I know what I'm talking about! I went there with my two Arab friends and they both agreed with me.  Overall, the place is way over priced, they charge 20% tip mandatory for party of 3!!! and the food is really bad that we couldn't finish the dishes! I regret going there.

Bay ridge area. we came around 4:30 on a saturday just to try the knafeh and were lucky that the dinner rush had not yet hit so we got parking and were seated without a reservation (normally you need a reservation!) knafeh was good, we also had a platter of the meat stuff that we didn't like very much. for literally 1 platter of 2 meats and rice and a small knafeh it cost us $60 includig tax and tip, so you can decide if it's worth going here. none of those in my party enjoyed the platter, the meat was too dry for our taste. the knafeh, though good, was not worth $16 or whatever crazy amount. if you've got money to blow support this restaurant. they're nice.",

        "caption": "Disappointing. After reading all the great reviews, I thought we'd have an amazing meal here, but what we had was lackluster at best. The chicken was very dry. I ordered my lamb medium rare and it came very well done. One of the servers was so wonderful, it's a shame we only saw him once. Everyone else seemed like they didn't care to be there.  We arrived at 3:30 which is definitely super early, but it was just how our day turned out. We were the only people in the restaurant which was fine. The host was eating, also fine, that's perfectly normal, especially for that time of day. What, wasn't fine, was that he seemed annoyed to seat us. I said hello with a smile and he just looked at me while grabbing menus and said nothing. He walked us to a table without ever saying a word! Strangely, we were seated directly next to the servers station which was less than ideal. Again, we were the ONLY people there and could have been seated anywhere, but, instead, had to listen to the staff gathered around the server's station chit chatting and playing around the whole time we were there. It's not to say they were so loud that they disrupted us. It's just that it gave us too clear of a picture of \"behind the scenes\" and we just felt awkward and out of place. The service was prompt which was definitely a positive. Except for once we got our food, we felt ignored. As I mentioned earlier in the post, the chicken was very dry, clearly overcooked. The lamb that I ordered medium rare, was officially well done. I have attached a picture to show it. As we left, we walked past three individual people who ignored us completely. We walked directly past each of them and they acted like we didn't exist!! I even tried to make eye contact to say thank you but was unsuccessful which was genuinely shocking. How hard is it to say, \"thank you\" to guests as they are leaving?? Or, \"have a good night\"? I was exasperated at that point.  The conclusion? Extremely disappointing. We will not be returning and will discourage others as well (if asked our opinion or for a suggestion in the area). Such a shame as there seemed to be success in the past. Those days are CLEARLY behind them.",

The blend of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean flavors in each dish was unlike anything I\u2019ve eaten before.  True to other reports, chef/owner Rawia made her way around the room and over to our table just to say hello and check in on things. But our waiter was more than capable and did an excellent job helping us select our dishes and wine.  Whatever you eat during the meal, I highly recommend getting the Knafeh to share for desert.
