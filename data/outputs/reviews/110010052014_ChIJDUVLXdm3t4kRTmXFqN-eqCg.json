The man behind its top-rated sandwiches now has his own shop on 14th Street in Logan Circle- Compliments Only. It's so small that it's easy to miss, but don't. Right before you hit R Street NW there's a brightly painted enclave with a gym and Compliments Only.  Once inside, you'll see a tiny space with a counter, kitchen space and a refrigerator with sodas and other drinks. Staff are masked and gloved and the menu is on the counter in plain view by the register.  The menu includes seven sandwiches with names like \"The Teamster\" (their version of an Italian hoagie) and \"Nancy Pelosi Eats Free.\" Sandwiches range between $11.50 and $14. Chips are an additional $3.25 and drinks are between $1.50-$3.  I ordered the \"Nancy Pelosi Eats Free\" and a soda. The sub was well-balanced and the honey chili aioli gave it flavor and a slight kick. It's not the biggest sandwich you'll order in the city, but I didn't leave hungry. They stamp a compliment on the outside of each sub, which I needed after the terrorism that happened at the U.S. Capitol this past week.  There are tables and chairs outside if you want to stay and eat.",
