My son and i had bite size steak, which was dry and chewy. The portion size was maybe 6 ounces. The carrots were dry as well. They had great flavor but were small, thin, and lacked succulence. The mashed potatoes were tasty but too thick. We had reservations and no other customers, however, our food took over 30 to arrive to out table. Our guest had a burger and fries. The burger was small, dry, but taste was good. The fries were crisp inside and out. Our bill was $82+ and not worth even half the price. We dine at many high end restaurants. If the food is quality, i dont mind paying the higher price. You get what you pay for! McDonalds and especially  Humble Burger have better burgers and fries without a doubt. Bojacks at Lewiston has higher quality bite size steak which makes Lodgepole feel like a half attempt at a home cooked average meal, not higher end or higher quality. My son and i both ended the evening with stomach issues that were so unpleasant i dare not detail it in my review...multiple bathroom  visits!!!! Save your money and go somewhere else.",

Michael, the Sommelier, took care of us as soon as we entered. We intended to have more of a European, multi-course meal and the staff was more than happy to accommodate us without rushing.  I was very impressed with our Somm's knowledge of his wine and the generosity and care he provided to make sure it was well paired with our food. The atmosphere was light and the lighting spot on. The only thing I would change is the house's selection of ambient music; it just didn't fit. We definitely plan on going back. 'Moved from three to five stars. Nicely done Lodgepole.  ******* Not bad. Overall, I thought it was over priced for the quality of food you received. The service was good. I can't stress enough how important that is. Its good to go to a place they respect that aspect of the dining experience.  I loved sitting out on the patio. Like most fine restaurants in the Moscow Pullman area, however, their prices have gotten ahead of the the quality of their dishes. I was especially disappointed with the gnocchi. I'm willing to bet, though, another trip might prove me wrong.",

The kitchen is open and you can watch the meal being made. The staff is actually very young considering the level of food and dining experience delivered. The meal was amazing. I ordered steak bites for and appetizer and the steak appetizer was better than most places serve as a primary meal! It was actually almost the same size of steaks I have recieved with full meals at other restaurants. Did I mention the perfectly seasoned garlic mashed potatoes heaped along side of it? The entree came out and our silverware was switched out completely. Perfect service. One meal was vegan and the same attention to detail was put in as though it was not a special order, but a meal regularly prepared in this fashion. My meal was chicken and potatoes with brussel sprouts. The chicken was seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the brussel sprouts, let's just say you could get your kids to fall in love with them here! Silverware was swapped out again and we had dessert. The desert was overly flavored with a syrup but still tasty. Dinner for the evening came out to about half of what I have paid elsewhere for the same experience. Amazing. The only downside, is there are plenty of patrons for the bar, which was 10 feet away from 1/3 of the tables. It was entertaining, but nobody wants to be at this fine of an establishment and have to deal with 50yr old men hitting on college girls that are too drunk.",

Then we ordered the Hama Hama Happy Hour clams along with the Roasted Brussels Sprouts for appetizers. The brussel sprouts were to die for!  We both had our eyes on and ordered the Butter Basted Rib-eye. Oh my Lordy!!!! That rib-eye was probably the most tender, properly medium rare, and perfectly seasoned/salted steak and beautifully presented with a slightly crunchy char. The Charred Cumin carrots were lightly seasoned and charred to perfection. The Cougar Gold baked Potato was seasoned and baked to a crispy skin perfection!  We were also sweetly treated to a complimentary desert - a Browned Butter \u201csomething\u201d cake, which we both warned our gracious waiter we would probably only be able to eat two bites. He insisted... saying we wouldn\u2019t be disappointed... he was spot on! We both scraped that plate clean! Tangy plum sauce with a bread-pudding like cake topped with the creamiest vanilla ice cream and nut crumble, garnished with fresh sweet apple slices. \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude0b  The restaurant itself is small and cozy. Wait staff are personable, helpful, team oriented and never stop moving, table chat always short, direct, helpful and sweet - making those that were IN the restaurant were served in a timely manner and service/table/dishes were attended to quickly - no hands were ever empty even if it was another wait staff walking by your table and removing dishes.  And to counter the low star reviews concerning the staff not answering the phone for reservations (suggested)...  it\u2019s true. I heard the phone ring several times, but everyone was extremely busy! Cause when you are actually seated in the restaurant... your experience while there is their #1 priority. The way it should be. \ud83c\udfc6 Leave a message, or call again to follow up. Or just show up (not at peak hours). We personally didn\u2019t have a reservation, and walked in about 5:15pm on a Saturday night. We were quickly and initially seated at the bar, then were offered and moved shortly after to a table near the pass.  We are throughly impressed, and have to say we were very disappointed that we only had $3.00 cash on hand, and couldn\u2019t tip more - because this restaurant is 100% gratuity-free and there was absolutely no option to add a tip without providing cash.  So if you go, bring cash for their pooled tip bucket - it\u2019s a team effort throughout.  And a big shout out to our waiter, Tanner! Thank you! You helped make our anniversary dinner truly a memorable experience! \ud83d\udc9e",

I think if the portions had been about 1.25x the size, that would have been enough to at least make us feel full, though not enough for leftovers. I will add though that I found my meal very delicious, but my wife thought her salmon was a little overcooked. I also didn\u2019t find the outdoor seating very comfortable. The chairs had an odd lean. The outdoor seating did have a nice atmosphere though. Overall, this restaurant was decent, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d go back again.",

It's hard to decide what to eat because no matter what I get I can't stop eating it. The specials they have always tend to challenge what flavors can be and push the envelope of taste. But the food isn't the only thing that is good here, the service is amazing as well. I've never seen a more involved and caring manager, he's there everytime I go and always makes sure the dinner is perfect. The kitchen is also very friendly, since it's in the open and there's even a small table connected with the kitchen so they can talk to the chef. Next time you're choosing where to go out for dinner there is no other place you should go but lodgepole!",

Another person at our table ordered the chicken and mashed potatoes - that was the best meal on our table as it was crispy on the outside and very juicy and we'll seasoned.

Multiple wait staff answered my questions about food and location.  Talked with others seated nearby about their choices for dinner.  All dishes looked excellent. I hear seafood flown in daily!  Saw a clam and mussel dish that was devoured! I never rate 5 stars on my first visit. This place actually gets 4 1/2 Stars! Rustic but clean brick inside for back wall, but clean and attractive upscale place and food. Menu eklective (sp) and interesting.  The menu states that TIPS are not needed...but I did it anyway! $$ level of price for good tastie food.  We would bring people here for dinner...Local Pullman places looked ok, but the small town layout of Moscow, ID looked great vs the whindy, run-down look of Washington's town. Makes a difference in your eating experience....  Oh, the special hand crafted lemonade was unusual but excellent in a very Tart&Sweet flavor.  Each one made with Fresh Lemon and probably a simple syrup, poured directly and mixed in the glass each time...refreshing! Thank you Lodgepole for a great experience!",

Better than the far more prestigious restaurants I've visited in San Diego, Chicago and Honolulu. Definitely recommend Lodgepole to anyone in the Moscow area, as it's the best food around!",

The halibut special  (seared, not so special) was served on a bed of Cold Asparagus and Lentils. Cold.  Meh. The ribeye was perfectly cooked and the pan-seared carrots superb. But ribeyes always leave a pile of fat and trimmings waste that simply don't happen with a NY Strip.  The crab cake appetizer was as good as any I've ever had. The wine and prosecco cocktails were excellent, and the wine list was that rare combination of well-considered and reasonably priced.  Overall, Lodgepole is a good restaurant with occasional flashes of greatness, and occasional lapses.",
