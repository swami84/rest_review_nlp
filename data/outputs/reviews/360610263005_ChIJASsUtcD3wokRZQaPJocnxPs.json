We were seated right away when arriving at the time of our reservation with only two of the five persons in a party ( The others arrived shortly after ) Each one of us got a temperature check. The host and staff were very nice and attentive throughout our entire stay. Ambience was great. Music very nice and the food menu offered a good amount of choices. The food took a little bit longer than usual to come out, but it was nicely presented and everyone enjoyed their dish. Before leaving, we were treated by the owner (manager?) to a mimosa on the house, which was a nice touch. The restaurant has a cool vibe and is a hidden jewel on that block. We would definitely come back and imagine it to be a cool happy hour place as well. Ages in our group were 61, 54, 31, 29 and 23.",

Terravita NYC was the only place we passed that had a nice outdoor seating area that was also heated. You could tell that the owners really spent some money and time making sure that the vestibules outside were comfortable and cozy for the diners. The servers were also super friendly and obviously showed genuine interest in the customers well being.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and the braised short rib and chicken panini for our entrees. The 4 stars is because the calamari was tough but had good flavor. My short rib was perfectly cooked and had a nice undertone of rosemary that wasn't overpowering the meat. My mother's chicken panini was crunchy and flavorful made with fresh ingredients.  I ordered the mojito and was pleasantly surprised with a slight effervescence and a punch of fresh mint. I highly recommend the mojito, it was the best I've ever had. My mother's California cabernet was fruity and from a fresh bottle so it wasn't sour.  The drink/spirit menu is extensive and you are sure to find a drink that pleases your taste buds. Overall I recommend this place to anyone but be careful because the bill will rack up. Usually I can't justify spending upwards of $175 on dinner for two with drinks, but this place was definitely worth it!",

I also ordered crispy Brussel sprouts and it was cold and very little portions as well. The Grilled Octopus Tacos were $17 for 3 tacos and 1- The presentation was horrible, they weren\u2019t individually wrapped like most places do it and 2- For the Price they were tiny and I honestly don\u2019t care about the size if the presentation would had looked good and if they weren\u2019t cold. I love supporting local businesses and I hate writing negative reviews specially since so many restaurants are hurting but that doesn\u2019t mean that you order $100 worth of food and not receive it presentable or warm.

The Chipotle Carbonara is the best thing I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s creaminess, soft chicken breast, and hint of spice all blend perfectly to create an amazing dish!  They also make some tasty cocktails, my favorite is definitely the Green Gin Giant, perfect balance of flavors.  Everything is absolutely delicious. The staff is kind, and very attentive. The nice minimalist and clean design of the place is much appreciated, very modern and airy, even now how they have their outside set up is nicely designed.  Absolutely love and recommend this place!",

They said the delivery would take about 25 minutes and it took almost one hour. I will not be ordering from here again. They definitely got a lot of work to do with the pricing and service.

The inside was long and narrow and long, clean lines with modern design. They had more seating in the back, the set up can allow larger group comfortably.  The atmosphere was friendly and laid back, but also a bit slow\u2026 We ordered Bacon Fritata and Classic Cheese Burger. Fritata was surprisingly good, very fluffy and seasoned just right. It came with something looked like a croquette. Whatever the name of this item is, it was packed with flavor, really delicious!  I add Sunny Side Egg to the Classic Cheese Burger for $1 extra. It came with a side of thick-cut fries and a pickle. The egg was cooked perfectly. The burger didn\u2019t have anything else on it, just the patty, cheese and egg. There was no option to add anything like lettuce or tomato either. Overall, it was a good burger, nice and juicy.  Since they were not huge in portion, we ordered dessert. They didn\u2019t have a dessert menu, but had a couple of desserts to choose from. We chose Chocolate Mousse. It was good, not great, but good.  It was a nice brunch, the service was again very friendly and polite, but can be very slow. It took a while to get a bill, even thought it wasn\u2019t busy in here. Not a place to go if you are in a hurry. The price is a bit high for this neighborhood, especially since the portion is a bit small.",

But ultimately I didn't fine the brunch menu that interesting and my veggie omlette and home fries where quite bland.  I don't think healthy has to scarifce taste.  The prices are really reasonable and I will come back and try their bowls sometime.  Staff is very friendly.",

The restaurant is very cute and I enjoyed the ambiance but the food and server didn\u2019t quite meet my expectations. With the prices being high I expected to have quality food but the omelet I ordered on toast was far from that . The toast was stale making it difficult to cut through and the omelet was under seasoned. Furthermore, the server was quite lost and didn\u2019t seem to understand the accommodations I asked for since it\u2019s not what I received . Their was also a delay on him checking up on us or bringing us the check in the end .In addition to this the iced latte I ordered tasted watered down . However the owner was very sweet and attentive.  All in all, seems like it has potential and it\u2019s possible that I didn\u2019t get the best dishes they serve . Would possibly give it another chance in the future.",

The food: light and refreshing, but bursting with notes of different flavor.  She made sure to get my friend some house made pineapple ketchup and my burrito bowl was not overwhelming. Instead, it cultivated quinoa evenly with pepper and avocado. Allowing all the flavors to pop.  Looking forward to seeing this establishment thrive. Congrats!",
