Born in the Philippines and raised in a first generation Italian family, I was used to lumpia and pancit for dinner one night, and pasta with homemade sauce the next. So this place felt like a little slice of home, but elevated. I had the pleasure of dining in when they opened and am thankful for the take-out option they offer in these COVID times. The only bit on constructive criticism I have stems from my most recent experience.  We had made reservations for the New York Strip Steak dinner special, which included 2 starters, entree with a side of pasta, and dinner. We arrived and the staff informed us that they would fire up our order since they had just sold out (pro tip: head to Instagram to view their weekly dinner specials and call ahead to reserve, just in case they sell out at the time of your dine-in reservation). Having dined previously, we knew we ALSO wanted to order the lumpia & try the crab dip on top of our pre-ordered dinner special. After we had placed our order, we received lumpia, soup, cucumber & shrimp salad, steak, noodles, crab dip over and tiramisu over the course of 37 minutes. Now, I understand in these unprecedented times, there are time limits for dining in. However, that was neither verbalized when we arrived nor communicated when we made the reservations online, and I\u2019m not so tone deaf as to think I\u2019d be able to dine leisurely. The food was absolutely phenomenal and can\u2019t speak highly enough of chef Armani Johnson, but the lack of thought behind timing and coursing out of the menu to our table slightly rained on the dine-in experience.",

The bread was delicious though and clearly high quality olive oil. We had the 2 vegetarian pasta dishes, the tagliatelle and the agnolotti. The tagliatelle was incredible and I would go back just to have 2 of that dish and nothing else. Literally if that was the only thing I had tonight, 5 stars. After splitting those 3 dishes, we were still hungry and ordered the agnolotti. It was way too sweet for a main dish. Was not a fan at all.--BRING BACK THE TAGLIATELLE  Visit 2: The Cereal-Flavored Doughnuts! YUMMMMM  Visit 3: Heirloom Tomato Salad-that aioli was scrumptious Eggplant Cavatelli- don't normally go for eggplant but the pasta was amazing last time and was the only veg option.

I meant to take pictures of the rest but we forgot and ate them.  Sweet/salty/funk combos and textural contrasts in just this meal far exceeded this abc's expectations. The dessert wasn't too sweet, either. Idk by what sorcery the ice cream stayed fluffy after I'd re-frozen it once I got home, but that stuff was good.

        "caption": "Interesting place with a bit of a retro vibe, low couches, tiny martinis, wide and low wine glasses, and baby cups for water. I felt like a giant (Andre) at our table.  I typically never ask for anything but dish and beverage requests with pleases and thank yous and let everything play out around me, be that a dance of instruments playing in concert or a cacophony of sound. Our server was kind and tried very hard. With the final pasta dish taking over 45 mins to arrive, unpromted he brought over two comped appetizers. So they're conscientious, to say the least.  The food was a mixed bag. The deep fried crispy cheese filled, marinara sauce dipping sticks were great. Thanks to the server and the long delay of the pasta we had two of these. It's well balanced and loaded with garlic.  I might flatten the crisps in order to enable greater scooping of the sauce.  The second dish (and we had two of these too) was the shrimp. Wowza, the sauce combined with the grated cheese is putrid. If you have one or the other, it's fine but dipping the cheese topped shrimp into the intended sauce triggers an abnormal reaction. The sauce on its own is a little weird. I would say it's a marinara base with chili sauce. Marinara tends to have a slight acidity, but with the chili, it's really weird. Sorry. The shrimp are well cooked and crisp.  I really enjoyed the pasta, pictured below. It was well balanced. A definite reorder.  Overall, I think they may have some issues with timing, but the service puts an effort to counter balance that. The dishes were both great and, ummm, not great. Choose wisely.",

The food and service of our server specifically were about a 4, but management/restaurant service recovery made it a 5. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy, but there seemed to be only 1-2 individuals actually taking orders. Our server was nice but scatterbrained. She would say she told us things (like a drink was arriving late), but all 4 of us at the table didn't hear it. She didn't bother telling us we could order dishes with extra pieces (i.e. an extra lumpia) until after we received the order. So then one person had to wait for their share of the food. She also forgot our orders and had to repeat them several times. The food was creative and good, per usual with Bruner-yang. The meatball lumpias are absolutely delicious, we had to order another order. The mochi shrimp was so interesting, juicy yet chewy and slightly sweet from the mochi. The caesar salad was more of a cabbage salad, and was just ok - we wouldn't order again. We ended up ordering all the pastas, all of which have perfectly cooked pasta noodles in excellent delicious creative sauces. Beware the XO spaghetti is fishy due to the XO sauce. THe tagliatelle and agnolotti's sauces and flavor combinations were yummy. The fusili was probably our favorite (and apparently our server's too even though she didn't mention it at all until we ordered it later on in the meal). Though I would comment the soppressata was totally unnecessary, the pasta is so good, the cured meat didn't add anything to the dish. The meal had several hiccups, but the kitchen/management really honed in and sent us extra food, comp ice cream for dessert, to make up for the issues. At the end of the day, the restaurant has only been open 2 months, and service recovery is just as important as the meal itself. Thank you ABC Pony for recognizing that. We'll definitely be back!",

Lackluster-tasting food, trying too hard hipster vibe(receipt comes in a cassette tape, and extremely limited dessert selection(vanilla and chocolate ice cream...groundbreaking).  The fried shrimp was the best - to me it was the only dish that had a great taste and texture. The lumpia was fine but not good. I thought Italian restaurants could make al dente pasta but mine was mushy, the only texture in there were the bread crumbs. The dessert options were literally ice cream or poundcake. To top that, the flavors within those said desserts were vanilla, chocolate, cherry, or lemon poundcake. We passed on dessert.  Our server was nice and friendly, same with the staff but I would not recommend this place.",

Attached to an apartment complex, the corner venue harkens to fun nods of the 80s/90s with VHS tapes and stickers hidden amongst the wallpaper-- feel free to search. The ambiance is vibrant and easy, almost effortless. Not pretentious, and not too casual. It's the type of environment where time stops. We were there for four hours (not suggesting you do the same) and lost track of time.  FOOD. The food and drink is inventive. A balance of Italian and Asian nods, but probably a bit more Italian in terms of homemade pasta, imported Italian ice cream, and Italian classics. But where there are standouts is how the Chef incorporates surprises, whether it's the brightness of apples, capers, or Asian spice nods. And then there's Asian inspired dishes such as lumpia filled meatball meat and mochi fried shrimp in spicy tomato sauce. It's both surprising but not too pretentious. Oh the fresh crusty bread is a must. I think we asked for about four refills.  SERVICE. This is where the team shines. From being warmly greeted by Nikki when you enter to the seemingly family of staff (Emmanuel was our server) that kept wine and water glasses full while regaling us in fun conversation. And this was opening weekend. A time that is usually crazy, chaotic, and stress-inducing. And while all of that may have been happening, it was not apparent at all. This team is amazing!  A must go! Five stars.",

Here why this will become a D.C. favorite:  1) Food: The menu has twelve items on it so you know each and every dish is superb. To start, I had the lumpia. It's burrata and meatballs wrapped with a perfect spicy tomato sauce for dipping. Next, I had the egg drop soup. It's Italy's version of the famous soup and comes with housemade broth full of flavor. To finish, I ordered the artichoke salad with broken pesto and bread crumbs. It's well balanced and tasty.  2) Drinks: They have a healthy beer and wine list. They are developing their cocktail program, but in the meantime have a $10 daily rotating drink. I ordered the \"Weekdays at Bernie\" with rum, lime, and honey. I ordered two and wanted a third. One of the most affordable quality cocktails in the city.  3) Atmosphere: This place is just fun! It's a throwback to the 80s and 90s with vintage memorabilia scattered throughout the space. The design is simple, yet stunning. The wrap-around bar is crisp. Pay attention to the details in the art in the space too.  4) Location: It's in the bottom floor of a fancy apartment building called Novel South on the far end of Nacy Yard that it's almost in the Waterfront neighborhood, bridging two neighborhoods. It's Metro accessible and street parking nearby isn't too hard to find.  ABC Pony will soon be a destination. I have no doubt in that.",

The restaurant has a very fresh take on all their dishes. I had the egg drop soup which was very fresh with unique toppings. It was elevated compared to the egg drop soup you'd get at a typical Chinese restaurant. It is supposed to be themed around the 90s, but I didn't really get that from the decor or menu. The only 90s I could see were some VHS tapes above the bar. I would highly recommend this place for a chill date night or drinks with friends.",
