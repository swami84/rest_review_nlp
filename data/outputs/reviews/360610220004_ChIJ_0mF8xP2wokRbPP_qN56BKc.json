The location and setting is nice. Ambiance easily makes you want to stay for a while. The mac and cheese was delicious as were the catfish nuggets.  On the other hand, the Bellinis left a lot to be desired. While sufficiently alcoholic, the taste was off putting, leaving an almost expired fruity taste in my mouth. At the start I asked to switch the peach preserve for a pineapple one but that didn\u2019t help at all. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were bland and the chicken! I ate one of two pieces and barely got through the first. It wasn\u2019t cooked properly and I could smell the \u201craw\u201d on my fried thigh.  If I visit again I\u2019ll probably stay with the seafood options.",

The catfish appetizer for $15(presented and taste like some fish sticks)  The drinks are delicious(the menu for them and all the tiny whimsical details are cute but it doesn\u2019t make up for the other areas); but they should broaden their beer list, heineken, corona, 2 ambers and 1 belgium but no ipa\u2019s. come on..  Alas, it was my friends bday so I enjoyed myself, but I won\u2019t be back for the restaurant portion at all, maybe the jazz spot below it for music.  Tip: they have a happy hour 5p-8p that would be a good way to get a feel for their food items as there is a 3/$25 deal on some appetizers.",

Love the adult drinks. The had eccentric names of seasons, emotions and things. I had a sangria. Good tasting but for my tastebud it needed a little more kick! The bartender took pride in his craft making drinks. In my endeavor, I was attending my cousin's 50th Birthday party. B2 Harlem laid out a buffet spread of a variety food. I had a like of everything. Bake chicken, pasta tomato cream sauce, green salad, fried fish, green beans. It was very good. I can't be much help to you regarding the food from the menu. Parking was horrible but that's the case for most of the NYC anyhow.",

We sat at the bar so got to talk to the owner a bit and it obvious she has a true passion and joy of food , flavors and how they may work together.  A labor of love and it shows.

So same space just painted and the stage removed and couches added as seating, which gave it more of a smoking lounge or den or high end ladies lounge outside the bathroom feel....... I wasn't mad at that feel. I was slightly nervous when we arrived and were the only ones there on a Thursday evening around 6ish to which my mom continuously pointed out lol (Parents!). But I was determined to see what the revamp was about so mom had to yield plus it was my birthday.  So we powered through with a great music playlist of rap, R&B and afrobeats. A decent bartender and decent apps the Mac n Cheese being the right amount of cheesy and charred in cute mini cast iron pans (presentation is everything) and the Brussels sprouts that were also the right amount of charred and garlicky. And I must say that the slightly fishy smell we detected....... nose of a bloodhound I have dude to the garbage room being behind and below our window from where we were seated. Was not evident in our pan fried salmon and black sea bass. Overall the few minutes we had the place to ourselves was heaven and once full the vibe still remained my choice was good and mom had a great time.",

Ordered the unlimited Mimosas with our meal. Everything seemed nice including our server Andres. At some point while were sitting and talking Andres came and asked us if we could sit at the Bar because he had another couple that made reservations.... We had finished eating at that point, But found the request a little odd being that the place still had available seating... But ok I get it. We go sit at the bar and maybe 5mins later Andres brings our check, which we did not request . 3 mins later he comes to see if we were ready to pay, which we were not .  We kinda felt rushed at this point .... So fine I paid my $89.00 bill and left a $15 tip. When we asked for a refill on our unlimited Mimosas we were told that the unlimited special was for 1 1/2 hours . It didn't feel like we had been there that long , but it quickly begin to feel like we were being pushed out .  When I checked the website, I didn't read any thing about a cut off time for drinks , which is one of the main reasons people go to brunch. Our server never made us aware of this . And when is it a thing to ask a couple to move to the bar?  Overall it's a decent spot.... Good food , good drinks, but the service was horrible towards the end . That's not how you want people to feel leaving your place of business, unless you prefer for them not to return. Maybe that's what it was , maybe not .",

It was my first time visiting and this is definitely on my list of places I will become a regular at. I had the hangar steak with mussels as an appetizer. For drinks, the penicillin and the walk in the woods. Highly recommend penicillin if you're a fan of Moscow mules. The walk in the woods was the best way to end the night with my creme brulee dessert and the Rosemary comes freshly smoked. Also, got to support local restaurants in Harlem that are taking the food to another level!",

The decor and ambiance are out of a dream and I felt as if I had stepped onto a film set, perhaps the library of a very refined and well-read English Barrister (Lawyer) who might also have been an author or professor. However, once my friend and I had taken a seat at one of the restaurants \"French Windows\" discreetly placed above street level with very deep thickly planted window boxes outside for privacy and elegance, we realized that we were Uptown, but somehow not the Uptown I remembered from over a decade ago. The owners are incredibly friendly and the food is among the best I have had in many, many years and many, many cities. The use of the \"library scene\" is not only ingenious, but really works for the purpose of a restaurant. (Was there a showbiz designer involved?) I LOVED IT. Please visit it. I read a review about a girlfriend who went to the bathroom and didn't come out for an hour. You'd have to visit that bathroom to know why she stayed there. I felt the same way. Kudos and Cheers Galore to the geniuses who put this place together.",

And to top it off the gimlet was what kept me thinking of the place. I couldn't wait to go back. Ummmm, was it an off night? No smoking rosemary in the gimlet (there's a grocery store a block away....because that's what makes the drink), oyster sliders tasted as if they had sat around for a while and the buns were a bit cold. I had to send my burger back because the fried egg on top was way over cooked. But when I got it back, it was freaking delicious!! I'm writing this review because I think this place has so much potential. The decor is beautiful and it's the kind of neighborhood spot that can turn into a favorite. But food consistency is a critical component to that.",

A slight hiccup w parking but the host (whose name I wished I knew) was understanding as I was the only one there but enjoying the live band, and assured us a table for 5. We were seated and Dennis, our waiter WAS THE BEST!!!! Our food was delicious and we all RAVED over the catfish strips we shared in an appy. Our black heifer and black iris martins were smooth and PERFECT in taste. We digged in each others plates sampling each others fried chicken, bbq beef ribs, stuffed catfish, mmmm-mmmm mashed potatoes,  string beans, mac/cheese and spinach - ALL SEASONED WELL AND YUMMY. We were too stuffed for desserr but was assisted by another woman w drinks and some shrimp. WE ENJOYED OUR EXPERIENCE IMMENSELY but dont take our word for it (wink)",
