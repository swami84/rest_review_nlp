When I came she showed me my salmon and asked me if it was ok which I thought was really nice. It came with a huge portion of rice and an assortment of Japanese pickles. Each of them tasted delicious. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal from here and the location was walking distance literally across the street from our hotel.",
