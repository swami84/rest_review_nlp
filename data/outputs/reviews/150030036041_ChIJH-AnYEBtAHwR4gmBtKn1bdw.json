Very had to describe.  It isn't very sweet, light, but not to light, and the textures along with the flavors are not your typical.  They make everything fresh and on the spot.  The ladies working there are supper friendly and the shop is clean and neatly kept.  There is more than their signature Korean dessert and ice cream.  They also offer a wide assortments of Korean mochi in small single serve packages to gift or party platters that are decorative and very colorful.",
