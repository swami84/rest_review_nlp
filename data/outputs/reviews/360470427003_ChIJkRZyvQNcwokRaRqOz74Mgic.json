None of the plates were bad, some were actually pretty tasty but overall I would say it was \u201caverage\u201d.  The Takoyaki was tasty. The shell was tasty, tasted like it was fried perhaps and had a good chunk of octopus in the middle. Tasty but missing ginger perhaps?  The gyoza was really good. Crispy and full of flavor, just how I like it! This might have been the highlight of the meal.  The tatsuta age was fresh and juicy with a good batter on it. The only complaint was that it was missing maybe a little salt? The taste was good but just a tad too bland.  The tonkatsu curry was pretty tasty. The pork slices were nicely breaded and thick and not dry. The curry itself tasted good too. This was perhaps my second favorite dish when I went.  Lastly, the ramen. The ramen was pretty tasty and the pork was cooked very well with a lot of flavor. The noodles were a little firmer then my personal preference but that is all on me since I like them pretty soft.  Lastly the ambiance and service. The place looked a little shabbier then the photos so maybe they are in the middle of some renovation during the pandemic. It wasn\u2019t bad but the pictures on Google maps do look a bit cozier and nicer.  The service, was actually pretty good considering it is just the one guy there. He was attentive and nice and I did not get impatient.",

The appetizers were good. We ordered takoyaki, gyoza, fried oysters, fried chicken, katsu curry and ramen. The ramen was the only thing I didn\u2019t care for. My Tokyo shouyu broth was on the salty side for me personally. The noodles were nice and firm. The half egg taster a bit sour. If the broth wasn\u2019t salty I would of enjoyed it more. But the highlight was their katsu curry. Nice subtle heat in the curry and the pork was nicely fried.",
