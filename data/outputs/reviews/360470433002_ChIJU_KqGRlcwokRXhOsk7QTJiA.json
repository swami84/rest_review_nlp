To provide a little credibility on my part, I\u2019m not Vietnamese, but I\u2019m a native New Orleanian that grew up eating a lot of Vietnamese food, because it\u2019s part of the culture. We had bahn-mi after school, pho when it was cold, etc etc etc. That said, I ordered a lemongrass chicken pho today on a whim, and I can assure you that this just simply isn\u2019t pho. This is chicken soup with vermicelli noodles. Nooothing about this tastes authentic or original, and quite frankly a lot of the flavors don\u2019t make sense. Pho broth is sweet, sour, salty: complex. This broth has the anise down (almost to an overwhelming amount), but there\u2019s no complexity to it at all. Add that to the fact that the chicken was overcooked so it just fell apart in the soup, it confused a lot of the flavor profile even more.  This isn\u2019t necessarily to tear down this business, nothing was nasty or gross, but I think some consideration and thought needs to be given to the recipe that\u2019s being used. I feel like once they nail the broth part, this place could really be a hit.",

Most people seem to either get delivered or take out. You can still eat on premises but seats are really limited (~8). It's an extremely simplistic menu (Pho or Banh-Mi then Chicken, Beef or Veggie) but all for the best as they definitely master their kitchen. I had a Lemongrass Chicken Banh-Mi. Tasty chicken and a quite refreshing vegetables mix. Though good, the result was slightly blender than I like and I felt the need to add some (Hoisin?) sauce. She had a Smoked Brisket Pho perfectly seasoned (absolutely no need to add chili, hoisin, salt or anything else) Therefore, I recommend first-timer to go for the Pho and experience what they do best!",

There is seriously no other Vietnamese place within Bushwick, and who knows maybe even, *gasp* Brooklyn!  As of now I can say I'm an expert on their food, I've literally eaten everything on the menu. My best advice for you is, brisket or go home, in either your pho or bahn mi. Even if you don't get the brisket, you'll still cry over how perfect the food tastes, smells, looks, AND feels. But that brisket will honestly bring you to nirvana.  Pho has everything you want in there. Perfect array of vegetables from bean sprouts to basil leaves to, yes the spicy Thai pepper! If the food doesn't make you cry because of how savory and delicious it is, these peppers will get you going. What's even better is you can choose for yourself what you want in there! They'll give you a separate container or plate with all of that!  The Bahn mi with their everyday fresh baked rolls is game changing!! Take the vegetables they put in their pho, now put it in a sandwich (mindblown.gif). Alright you with me still, great. When was the last time you had delicious baked bread in Bushwick? Probably never because you're an idiot and would rather drink a cappuccino in the morning. #carbstildeath  Get their bahn mi, wait no, the pho!  NO GET BOTH YOU DINGUS!!!!  On a less satirical note, prices are definitely up there, but in reality the food makes it worth it without a doubt. Would it be nice if it was a dollar or two cheaper, sure. But, I don't make the rules I just deal with them.  Show these guys some love because they clearly deserve it and they will have more and more food that will continue to level the playing field. Keep killing it guys!",

        "caption": "**This review is not for the food** Lapin and I read read so many good reviews about this place that we went out of way (it really was just an excuse for us not to do our errands) to try it. The tiny alcove took a bit for us to find but the best gems are usually the hardest to find. When we arrived, only one other person was waiting for her order to go. The menu was very limited and written on a chalkboard near the kitchen/ordering area. We ordered an lemongrass chicken and the pho banh mi. The cashier just stuck out her hand after she told us the total while chewing her gum very obnoxiously (perhaps, she was a high schooler but still unprofessional). It seemed a bit weird and rude.  By then, the woman who was waiting got her order and left.  Lapin and I decided to sit on the family style picnic table and wait for our food. Twenty minutes passed and both Lapin and I are wondering what is taking them so long. By then, a gentleman with several tattoos has come in and placed an order along with two girls. We all sat in the big table waiting for our orders to come.  Roughly 30 minutes after everyone were seated, I was staring at Lapin like he was a delicious piece of drumstick. FINALLY, the food came. Great, awesome, it was about time! Sadly, when I looked into my banh mi, something look off (I am allergic to pork and beef so I examine things closely). I poked at the white meat and it felt to spongy to be chicken. And if it was chicken it was processed or it went bad. Turns out I had tattoo man\u2019s order and someone else had my order (Sorry guy for manhandling your sandwich). No one at that table actually had their correct order, it was like playing musical food. I understand missing up or two but five orders.  And why were Lapin and I waiting for almost an whole hour to get our food. We don\u2019t know these people (no offense), why would we want our food all at the same time...it\u2019s not like we were going to eat together(well technically we were all at the same table). Then the same camel chewing cashier came over and looked at us like we ordered the wrong thing. She took one of the plates from the two girls who were holding their food with their hands and put it in front of me. Like seriously, I didn\u2019t want to eat something that someone else manhandled (again, sorry tattoo guy). After saying I am not going to eat that, they said they would remake it not after giving me some attitude but after a minute of thinking about it, I didn\u2019t want to wait another hour for my food (and my mood was already drained). I went up and asked for money back. One of the guys cooking, said it would be ready soon and that we should give them a chance but honestly I gave you an hour (and I might have stayed if they offered more than attitude...maybe like an apology before we asked for our money back...would have been nice). We got our money back but not with some attitude and disgusted look from the cashier.  They have a limited menu, bit pricey than other Viet places, and it\u2019s a small shop --- how they can mess up so royally is beyond me.",

        "caption": "The food is great but not to sure about the service. I ordered my sandwich and then the girl at the counter had some friends come in and they got their food before me. I'm pretty sure that's not a good way to run your buisness. Also pretty sure her friends didn't pay. Just saying maybe she should get another job. I won't be going back there now. It's worth going to the city to get better pho and service. I feel bad for the owners that they don't know what goes on at night.",
