Our server was super attentive, but not annoying. I love that they offer you several options of fruit or cucumber for your water, it's a nice tough. Had dinner there with my boss and husband. We bought several things and shared them since we just couldn't decide! My husband and I had the Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque, which were both great. All three of us shared the Hot House Tomato Salad, Florida Stone Crab Claw Platter, with asparagus and mashed potatoes and the Miso-Glazed Sea Bass with crab fried rice and slaw. Everything we ate was delicious! Prior to my boss telling us about Trulucks, we'd not even known it was there. We'll be going back there to try out that seafood tower!",

Second, the buffet stations are spread throughout the multiple rooms of the restaurant so it can be quite a feat to maneuver on your own through the crowded restaurant with full plates  Those things aside, we had a wonderful brunch in particular because of the great service. Drinks were refilled without asking, plates were removed quickly and they were happy to let us split checks.  The buffet includes the usual's like build your own omelets, fresh waffles, and lunch items like fried chicken and vegetables. The stars though are the oysters on the half shell, jumbo shrimp (peeled and ready to eat), sushi, crab legs, tenderloin and a big dessert spread. I couldn't possibly list all the items! It's a bargain if you come hungry and enjoy seafood.  The only downsides are the crab on the buffet isn't quite as good as what they serve during dinner and as you'd expect, it's crowded and as I said earlier, hard to get around. I'd definitely come again.",

I came in with a few friends fir happy hour because I\u2019ve been to both the restaurant and happy hour at another location numerous times and it has been nothing less than excellent each time. We ordered our drinks and my martini was most definitely not the vodka I ordered, rather a seemingly house vodka. I mentioned something to the waitress and she said it was the vodka I ordered but would make a new one. The new one tasted the same but just watered down a little. Oh well I drank it because I didn\u2019t want to complain twice.  We ordered three appetizers which took a HALF HOUR to come out. When they finally did come out, the calamari was cold and the dipping sauce had a thick layer on top (what happens when mayo sits out for a long time), the flat bread was room temperature and the tuna was grisely, mushy and very light pink (sign of it not being great) and the seaweed had a very odd appearance and consistency. The waitress didn\u2019t come by for a while, so we ate the cold calamari and flatbread. She finally breezed passed saying \u201ceverything is great?\u201d Without giving us the chance to respond before she was past us.  After talking this place up to my friends, I was embarrassed to say something again, so instead I called the next day and spoke to the manager about our experience. He said he would look into it and call me back. I never heard back.  Again, Trulucks in general is amazing, it is just the Chicago location that has clearly dropped the ball and isn\u2019t upholding the standards of quality and service that Trulucks possesses.",

They could not have fallen further from this status if possible.  Our first and very fatal mistake was to go against our better judgement and not use Spot Hero and use their Valet Service. I cannot scream from the Chicago Rooftops loud enough (hence the soon to be using all caps) NEVER USE THEIR VALET! We left our convertible and when we came back, the valet attendant had a bright orange parking ticket in his hand and wanted us to pay it. They had \"forgot\" to put a sign in the window for a brief moment and then parking ticket appeared\u2026funny concept. My husband said there was no way we were paying. They said they were going to pay it. As you can tell by this review, flash forward in time and spoiler alert, they did not pay it.  Let's move on the actual experience. The only reason this review is not 0 stars is for 1. Our waiter was awesome and 2. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. That is it. The food was mid-grade at best, half of the sides came out cold, as in frigid ice cold, the \"special, must have\" was horribly cooked and we all fell for it and order it. As if the whole experience was not bad enough, the gal cleaning the tables, dropped the chocolate knife down my brand-new white shirt and completely ruined it. She walked away as if I wouldn't know. I finally turned around to my friend to see I had a stain on my shirt, which I definitely did. At this point, the gal finally goes \"oh sorry,\" and walks away nonchalantly. She would have never said anything unless I had turned around to her.  After this lovely experience, we go outside to be hit with a parking ticket. I cannot express with enough vigor to say stay any from Truluck's on Chestnut. In our great city of Chicago, there are so many better places to find incredible food which is clearly not here and that you won\u2019t Ferris Bueller your car and leave you with ticket for their damages.",

Before leaving I asked to let the manager know why.  I\u2019m choking up recalling their kindness and responsiveness.  The manager insisted on comping the rest of the dinner and served us.  The whole staff gave my niece a card signed by them and they took a picture with her.  They had the bar make lemonade for her son and it\u2019s not even on the menu.  The chef made baked Alaska that was delicious with a candle and the chef served it to her.  And they just called to follow up.  I have never had a better customer service experience in my life.  On the way home in the car all that my niece and I could say to each other was ... WOW. AMAZING.  Over and over.

We tried Truluck's for the first time, usually we don't care much for chain establishments, this location used to be a McCormic and Schmick's that was ran down. Reece was our server, the service was exceptional and the food was prepared to perfection.  We enjoyed the seafood celebration appetizer, wedge salad, clam chowder, branzino and the surf and turf.  Wrapped up with the Baked Alaska and Coffee.  We will surely visit again. Just in case, it is something we didn't know.  There is a dress code here, no hats.

Unfortunately, the last few visits were disappointing, and this current one just broke the camel\u2019s back. I\u2019ve always sat at the bar and have always had amazing service from Ryan. The last time I was here, not too log ago, I ordered the fried lake perch which was recommended. It came out to me broiled, which was odd, and I figured they had given me a someone else\u2019s plate. I was given the option to have it remade, but I declined because I didn\u2019t want to bother the kitchen. I decided to give Truluck\u2019s another try, and this time ordered the New York strip, medium rare plus. The steak came out on a cold plate and rare, not on the sizzling 400 degree plate that was advertised on the menu. I sent the steak back to be cooked more and then it came back charred, cooked a little on the inside, but rare in the middle, also on a warm plate. I\u2019m embarrassed writing this review, I hate being THAT person, but I\u2019m disappointed. The service is amazing, the atmosphere is welcoming, but maybe something is off in the kitchen..I hope it gets taken care of soon.  P.S. Ryan gets 5 stars.",

When the manager called to next the day to ask about my experience, he was unapologetic. I will take my hard earned dollars elsewhere. For well over $100 each, I can be treated like a valued customer and get better food at a lot of places, even just up that street.",

Came with paltry amount of crab (I'd say a teaspoonful) and scant caviar and bearnaise. Over-price aside, I could barely taste any crab, and none of the briny snap of caviar of roe, all of which I'd hoped would complement the beef. Filet was well-prepared but a bit dry, and would have benefited from a bit more of the bearnaise to attenuate. Service was very good, however, hence four stars.",

I had the Salmon Bernaise it was mouth watering, i had the Crab cakes as an appetizer the best I have ever had and I'm a foodie.

The guy\u2019s voice was amazing and the cocktails were delicious! Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. We then moved next door for dinner and WOW. The waitress was knowledgable and guided us step by step through all the seafood options and explained to us where each item came from and showed us a tray which had plastic representations of sizes and types of all the varieties of shell fish. This was very helpful in making the decision of what we wanted to try. Every table gets freshly baked bread and butter which is amazing... we then went with the crab cakes. Hands down the best crab cakes I\u2019ve ever had! If I see them on the menu I always order them... so this is a big statement for me. We hen had the Rolls Royce of lobster.. which is South African lobster tails. It was absolutely fantastic and is served with melted butter. The wine menu was on point and the entire experience was one of the best I\u2019ve had in a while. This place is new and trying to prove itself! I highly recommend it and hope that when I return next year that it is just as good.",
