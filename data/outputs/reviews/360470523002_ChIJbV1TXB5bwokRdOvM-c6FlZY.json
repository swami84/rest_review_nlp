We had chicken hariyali appetizer which had a unique flavor to it. For the main course, we had Jhinga Luchi and kosha mangsho with garlic naan. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. For the dessert we had rasmalai which was so creamy and soft, we loved it. The owner salim bhai was very friendly and gave us a sample of their rice kheer to try which was marvelous. Will definitely be back for more!!",

I tried them for delivery - which is how we'll all be dining out for these next few weeks - and the quality was top notch amid a sea of takeout options.  I highly recommend the Lamb Phall for a thick and spicy curry dish. Extra Roti is always good, but the dish did come with more than enough rice. Bhel Puri made for a good topping and snack between bites but I'd only get the order of that if you're sharing - it was a lot!",
