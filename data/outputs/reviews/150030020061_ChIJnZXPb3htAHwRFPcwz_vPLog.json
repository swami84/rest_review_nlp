I don't remember the last time I received such service and could talk about it in this way.  From the start, when I called to make the reservation, the young lady was engaging and beyond friendly while placing my reservation. She took the time to describe the reservations for the evening and seating options. When we got there, we were greeted warmly and with full attention without distraction. Our server as well as others who partnered with him to complete our dinning experience were properly trained and professional, yet very personable and friendly at during the entire dining experience.  Moving on to the food, the menu isn't large, but there is a good assortment. We decided to go with all appetizers to make our dinner. This was a good move to allow us to try multiple flavors and mix it up with our drinks. Also, with the sunset view, we ate at our leisure.  The Calabrian Garlic Shrimp had an amazing flavor that rocked it. The Burrata is a must as well along with their Seasonal Dips and Roasted Beet Salad.  All bursting with flavor, beautifully plated, and top quality ingredients. For dessert, the Sweet Cream Gelato with Olive Oil and Maldon Salt was a surprisingly good finisher to the meal, but if that is not your thing, their Tiramisu was very good as well.  Pointers would be to make sure you make reservations, dine early for sunset view, and ask for a high table. The high top chairs are surprisingly comfortable. Order your food to share.  We plan to go back and do highly recommend this dinning experience.",

There was a simple valet service at the front which made our entrance and exit painless. The outdoor dining ambiance is beautiful with lovely views of the pool and city. Every worker that we came in contact with from the hostess, to the servers, to the manager were all incredibly kind and made our dinner so memorable!  The only reason I'm giving this review a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because I came from LA which has absolutely amazing Italian food and although this food was delicious it wasn't the 5 star Italian food that I've had (but it was to be expected since this isn't the main food of island).  ~What we ordered~ Drinks: - Ancient Peaks Cab Sauv Bottle. This was an amazing bottle of wine that was reasonably priced. Paired well with everything in our meal.  Appetizers: - Calabrian Garlic Shrimp (Kauai Prawns). Very delicious! I loved the sauce that the prawns were sitting in. Definitely use the bread to dip in the sauce - Buratta. Creamy and delicious. Cannot go wrong  Side: - Charred Broccolini. Broccolini is my absolute favorite vegetable so this side did not disappoint.  Mains: - Porcini Pappardelle. The noodles were thick and delicious. I loved the lightness of the sauce and vegetables to balance the thick noodles. - Spaghetti All\u2019amatriciana. The favorite of the 3 pastas we tried, but be careful because there is a mild spiciness to it if you are sensitive. - Spaghetti Carbonara - pancetta, parmesan, egg, pecorino. The server mixed the egg in throughout the pasta which gave it an overall creamy sauce texture.  Dessert: - Tiramisu. This is the only thing we tried that I wouldn't recommend. This dish needs a lot of work. Didn't taste like a proper tiramisu.",

Not only were we attended to by our server, but the entire staff seemed to be constantly paying attention to all the fine intricacies of service.  Upon our departure we were given a personalized thank you card with an invite to the next tasting dinner, what a cute touch \uf04a  Obiviously we will be accepting the invite.

However, because of our Statewide stay-at-home orders,  our State's dine-in options have been severely restricted and October 15 turned out to be perfect timing as our State has been re-opening businesses just as it has allowed Trans-Pacific traveler in. Because we were concerned about aerosolized COVID-19 droplets in enclosed dining spaces, we sought out Quiora's casual alfresco dining layout overlooking Fort DeRussy Beach Park out to the ocean.  We made our dinner reservations via OpenTable.com and chose a time that would allow us to catch the colorful sky from the setting sun during the early part of our celebration.  Arriving at the porte coch\u00e8re, we were directed to the valets who greeted us with Aloha as we dropped off our vehicle into their care.  A hostess met us as we exited our vehicle, checked us in against her reservations list, and summoned an elevator for us to take up non-stop to the 8th floor.   We exited the elevator lobby and was met by Tina, who had called earlier in the day to confirm our contact information for contact tracing, as she congratulated and thanked us for choosing Quiora and the Ritz-Carlton.  We were escorted to their Diamond Head Tower where Quiora's hostess took over and got us seated at a high top (of our choice).   Being that this was our first time to dine at Quiora, we surely appreciated the personally escorted tour from the elevator to the restaurant.  Our server, Kayla, immediately congratulated us on our Wedding Anniversary and greeted us with professional yet warm hospitality.  We could see her smiles in her eyes and friendly voice as she articulated Quiora's menu of rustic and seasonal Italian cuisine featuring locally-sourced fresh vegetables and seafood.  Quiora is noted for their fresh house-made kinds of pasta which their executive Chef specializes in.  We toasted our special occasion and placed meal orders with Kayla. Kayla's service partner was Mindy, who interchangeably brought out our dishes at an easy pace and chatted with us while either she or Kayla cleared our table.  From start to finish, our experience and dine was fantastic.  Everyone was respectful and truly appreciative of our patronage.  They all kept their face masks on throughout the experience.

The service and enthusiasm of the staff all the way from when we pulled into the valet was top notch. I gave my name to the valet and magically the whole place knew who we were for our reservation and treated us so well like friends and family.  Everyone was so excited to have us dine with them on the first night of reopening and it really showed in their service. The view if such a great one, open air seating and perfect for a 6:30 reservation to watch the sun go down. The drinks were great to start off with and the food was really great. No over the top but simple straight to the point flavoring and fresh. Definitely a great time and will for sure come back here and to try the other restaurants in the Ritz.",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) A casual Italian shop in Ritz-Carlton Waikiki. Tonight was Christmas and there was a $ 125 course. The \u00e0 la carte was less than usual, but it was said that it could be prepared. This was a big mistake. I chose it myself. . .  3 appetizers. The hamachi carpaccio is full of fishy odors ... I didn't like the octopus squid ink, but the other hamachi kama laughed if it was Japanese. The taste is ok, but tiny. The feeling of purchasing cheaply in the market is overflowing.  Next is pasta. Persimmon pasta is probably home-made hand-made noodles and is well cooked. It is the best taste I have eaten today, with a refined taste that takes advantage of the flavor of the salmon. Three fish ravioli are about 1/3 the size of Japanese dumplings. Small ... The taste was quite good.  Mainly shrimp and white fish. This is not bad either. But tiny ... And the cauliflower on the side is scorching ...  Dessert is a choice of tiramisu and panna cotta. It is delicious. Dessert is big for some reason.  I like the thin seasoning while valuing the taste of the material as a whole, but all are made up of cheap materials such as shrimp, octopus, hamachi, etc. There is no. Even if we reduce the number of items, it is a pity that we should make the material attractive. Compared to Bernini near Ala Moana last year, satisfaction was less than half.  What made me feel even worse was the atmosphere inside the restaurant, like the breakfast hall of a third-class hotel. All you have to do is put a table and chairs in a space where there was no other use, and make a restaurant appearance. Also, I wanted to put a little decoration, I put a wall with ALOHA letters on a wooden board with a surfboard, but the front was not good, but the back was bare without makeup and I could see the fastener Yes. Speaking of \u201ccasual\u201d sounds good, but the atmosphere in this store will be disappointing even if you enter for lunch. However, customer service is a good impression. A smile came out and I can tell you that he always cares. Since the pasta was delicious, there is a sense of expectation that the usual menu seems to be satisfactory. But if you think that burnt cauliflower came out, I feel a little dangerous. It is a pity that the dishes are cheap.  I'd like to go on a non-special day next time, but be careful on days when you want to cook course meals. Choose Taormina if you don't want to remove it in Waikiki Italian. If it's cheap, Appetito is also good.

I have lived in Europe the majority of my life and had the privilege of going to Italy multiple times and have experienced real Italian food I also have experience American Italian food this fell short. I got the carbonara which was served in a dog bowl of sorts it was a very mediocre presentation of a meal and that's all that was served a bowl with pasta which appeared to be some type of cheesy sauce with an egg on top with pancetta mixed in.  Not really what you would expect of a traditional carbonara you would think when you charge $20+  for a bowl of pasta and a sauce you would have serve bread alongside it. The menu was extremely limited",
