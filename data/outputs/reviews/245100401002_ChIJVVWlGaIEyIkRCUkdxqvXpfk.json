The burger, the subs, the fried rolls, the beverages, everything! DCAC Eatz is a great black owned business and has that great black owned business flavor. It's vegan, but it's still delicious! I recommend this to everyone looking for something tasty.",

The Vegan Burger delicious as well as the CHIK something salad sandwich... THEY ARE A LITTLE PRICEY 15.00 for the burger and thats the only reason for the 4 stars. but well worth it. I meant to take a pic but it was sooo good i demolished it quickly",
