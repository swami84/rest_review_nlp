On top of that - it was 20 dollars and only came with 2 pieces of shrimp, 2 scallops, and a small piece of cod. Overpriced is an understatement.  My fianc\u00e9 got the baby octopus roll and unfortunately she could only stomach a few bites. The marinade they used was just downright awful.  The quality of the fish seemed good but other than that - not worth your time.  Waste of money in our opinion - better places in the area for the same type of food.",

I got the hot lobster roll that's suppose to be drenched in garlic butter and my lobster roll was SO DRY! The lobster roll was also VERY skimpy. I've never had a lobster roll that was that empty with filling and charge $20. I've had more lobster and paid less from a bigger company. Not only was the lobster roll dry as a desert, the roll itself was burnt from being over toasted and the lobster was extremely over cooked. When I said something to the waitress she just looked at me like she was incompetent and didn't say anything. Then the cook came over and asked if we enjoyed our meal and I said no and explained why. He ALSO looked incompetent in the face and didn't say anything and walked away. No apology for a terrible experience - NOTHING. Would NEVER come back here and would NEVER recommended anyone eat here.

Upon receiving our order, we asked for one additional salad dressing and was told that we had to pay for it. We were appalled at the fact that we just spent almost $40 for two salads (yes, $40 for 2 salads) PLUS a $4 tip and couldn't even get ONE salad dressing on the house! When I mentioned this to the server, she politely stated, \"I just work here.\" Which is true. It comes from the top down. She's simply an employee being advised by higher ups.... So I contacted the powers that be to inform them that as a courtesy, they should spare an additional tiny tub of salad dressing to someone, anyone spending $40 damn dollars for 2 salads!! Because of so much competition, I weigh heavily on quality customer service. Needless to say, I will never patronize their establishment again! I will also suggest my colleagues do the same. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Shame on them! I would have given one star, but the server was polite so I'm giving two.",

I just knew their food was going to be amazing simply by the smell of the seafood and spices and boy was I right it was so GREAT. I loved the atmosphere reminded me of city island but in Brooklyn ! Definately will be returning to try other things. I had the steamed seafood shrimp hot mess It was grade A+ Food for sure. I will be going back to try other items on the menu for sure.",

The fish was cooked perfectly with a nice crust and not dry inside. The seasoning was good, but not even spread. Some areas had too much salt and some none at all. The salad comes with a dressing and I chose vinegaette, which wound up being straight oil with some herbs so I didn't use it. Overall, it was a well cooked and fresh piece of tuna with salad for $15.",
