Food gave me diarrhea it was so bad ! Dessert the apple crisp was even worse and the server didn't warn me about the ultra hot plate so I burned my fingers grabbing the plate to move it. Listen maybe a year ago this place was descent but as of Nov 2020 dine elsewhere unless you have no standards no taste and youre willing to be served poorly . Lunch struck out here . Gross",

However, on our last visit we were a bit disappointed in some of the changes to our service. They now do an up charge of 3$ if you want to share your meal:( whereas before this was never an issue, they even split the food on the plate before serving it to us. Also, the ceasar salad that accompanied the meal was so sparse that you could literally see the bottom of the plate. I have never seen a salad so small ( I wish I would have taken a photo). Also, it appears that the portion size of the spaghetti and meatballs has been downsized as well. We can no longer share a meal there and we will be forced to order each our own. We were very surprised and still hungry when we left. We literraly went to another restaurant afterwards to eat.",

Next time he will be ordering the Chicken Alfredo since he was too afraid to last night because we\u2019ve had nothing but disappointment in the other Italian places we\u2019ve tried in Cape Coral. The waitress was also very friendly and nice. It\u2019s a very cute little restaurant. Clean and nice decor. Highly recommend for anyone looking for good Italian food!!!!!! 5 stars!!!!!!",

The food here is full of flavor without relying on too much of a good thing.  Just the right amount of sauce and cheese, spiced just right, not at all greasy.  Wonderful pizza crust, thin and a little crispy on the bottom but tender, hand tossed with maybe a tiny bit of cornmeal on the bottom like old school Italian family home cooking.  Friendly, casual place with a subdued atmosphere and happy diners.  We've tried a lot of the Italian places locally and this has fast become a favorite.  My spouse grew up in an Italian family where food was one of the most important parts of life - she won't even touch mediocre Italian food, but she loves Sicily Trattoria.  High praise from someone with world class cooks and a couple of restaurants in the family.",

Basic beer menu and really nice wine selection and they even have a wine bar (see pics).

Was it worth the wait?   Yes.  First I was offered up some house made bread. Warm & tasty.  Then grandma minestrone soup. The best around. The secret just a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Then the main entree lasagna.  very good pipping hot out of the oven.  Service was wonderful.  I must try the pizza.  YOU must give them a shot they are very good.",

One of the greatest pizza markets in the country. What I had tonight didn't really compare to what I'm used to getting in a pizza. In my humble opinion the crust was too thin and had a burnt flour taste to it. Almost tasted like cracker. The sauce (which should be the flavor base of the pie) was very bland and lacked any trace of spices. The cheese had a great flavor and even melt accross the pie. It was actually the highlight of the pie. As I said in the beginning, I will try their dinners at a later date. Until then.. Eat out often and demand good food. You are paying for it!",
