On multiple occasions my order has been ready much later than scheduled and only after I\u2019ve had to remind them to start working on it upon arriving after pickup time, like today. When that happens you also have to wait in line behind everyone who is ordering and wait for them to answer the phone before helping all of those people before you can even remind them about your order. Again, this has happened every time I\u2019ve come here except once. Today I was standing next to a woman who was picking up a large catering order. She had been waiting for over 45 minutes and it was clear that the order had not been started until she arrived, no one was hurrying for her, etc. Both of us chose to order here for business meetings which was a mistake. I\u2019ve given them a lot of chances, don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do it again.",

For the average eater, you have a variety of sandwiches and potatoes, along with a slew of soups, stews, and other bowl-worthy contenders. But what stands out is the salad bar.  I know, salad is fo- don't get me started. If someone turns their nose up at a fresh salad with colorful veggies, crisp lettuce, delicious dressings, and wonderful toppings, especially tasty bacon and cheese, I can't help you.  What helps Jason's stand out is their selection of salad add-ons. For a bit extra, you can get chicken, beef, salmon, avocado, or freshly cooked eggs, which elevates a great salad bar into a phenomenal experience as consistent as a McDonald's Quater Pounder with Cheese. Perfectly cooked eggs, moist chicken, flaky salmon, tender beef, and smooth, creamy avocado all turn health food into fare I'd be more than happy to serve at home. I can stay on track with my dietary needs and be happily full when I'm done, and if I'm not, I can always go back for seconds.  For those who don't have these limitations on what they can eat, they also have tasty breads, crackers, cookies, sodas, and if you're really indulgent, free soft serve ice cream, complete with crunchy cones and syrups.  No matter if you're following vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, primal, Paleo, keto, or Standard American Diet, there's options for everyone at reasonable prices, huge bang for the buck, all wrapped in a relaxing environment that I'm more than happy to head into, be it for stop-and-go eating, or a regular sit-down. Jason's Deli is one of the best options possible for any class of eater.",

It's kind of sad, I suppose, the poor little white bowl, clean as a whistle, handed to me by a super-friendly J-Delian, but my aim is to rectify that. And well.  So, the service here is really friendly and the food looks and tastes delicious, but I've had to wait for food to be brought out (such as when I ordered the 4 ounces of steak to go with my salad) and it wasn't done very timely. To be fair, I only tried it once, but on the next trip, my dinner companion experienced the same long delay and we eventually had to ask where our food might have gotten off to.  The salad bar. This is a shining star. There are choices for greens, olives, cheeses (including feta), boiled eggs, real chopped bacon, tomatoes and peppers and artichoke hearts, oh my! Lots and lots more to choose from and the salads I have made here are outstanding, filling, and always leave me with a smile on my face and a glow in my heart.  Still, I want one of the sammiches!  To say a little about the steak I ordered. Very little, I guess, because the word that comes to mind is \"disappointed.\" It wasn't much steak for the price, it wasn't good steak for the price, and it wasn't prepared very well...again, for the price (plus, it didn't arrive until I had made my second salad!). I was disinclined to try it on my second visit and feel I was a better man for the decision.  I will be back, definitely, this salad bar is fantastic. And, damn it, I want one of those sandwiches!",

The gal at the counter was friendly enough and did not try to upsell me, which was nice. I got the drink from the beverage center and glanced at the salad bar, which looked kind of sad to me. I selected a place to sit. The food came out quick and hot. Someone did come by to ask if everything was ok. One table nearby had empty plates on it and I wonder how long it was there. It was cleaned off while I was there. Everything seemed clean, but the dining area was oddly very dimly lit, so I could not really tell how clean everything is.",

They have seafood gumbo but I won't be eating that until they use local seafood. Everything I've tried so far (Shelley's Deli Chick croissant, muffaletta and Italian Cruz poboy) was delicious and reasonably priced especially for the amount of food you get. Cookies and pumpkin coffee cake are YUM. Important for me due to a food (pesticide) allergy: I can vouch that the apples I had in my delicious side fresh fruit cup were DEFINITELY organic as promised because I ate all 3 slices with absolutely no reaction, and I start reacting within 1-2 bites if it's not. To me this is pure joy!!) The crowd has been big every day but because of the size of the restaurant and ample parking in Wilshire Plaza, it's a quick and easy stop. I'll be back to try some more!",
