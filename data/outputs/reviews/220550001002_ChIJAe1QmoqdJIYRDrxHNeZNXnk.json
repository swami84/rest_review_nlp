        "caption": "FINALLY! A late night grub spot in Lafayette!!! I've only been waiting 17 years for this!!! I grew up in NOLA and came to Lafayette for college and couldn't leave. I love this place! But there has been NO late night food (past 2am) except Mel's and Taco Bell since I moved here. This place is legit! Prices are good, food is good, open til 3am (yes, 1 hour makes a huge difference). Great for a working musician like myself who has no energy to go home and cook after a 3 hour set on a Saturday night. Located in heart of downtown, so all you Jeff St drinkers can walk there(don't drink and drive!) Cati-corner to Don's on Lee St. No inside seating, just a walk up window and a bench or 2. I just take mine home and flip on a movie and veg out with a massive burger with sides. They also have hot dogs, Cuban sandwich, Philly Cheese steak, fries tots, sweet potato fries and onion rings. And sides are cheaper with an entree order(Yes, incredibly some places still don't understand that sides should be cheaper if you order an entree). This place has been a long time coming for Lafayette, I'm just glad that when it got here it wasn't just fried trash. Tasty late night eats!!! Check it out! My favorite is the Dbl Stan, dressed, add slaw and jalapenos with a side of onion rings. ($11-12). Legit!",
