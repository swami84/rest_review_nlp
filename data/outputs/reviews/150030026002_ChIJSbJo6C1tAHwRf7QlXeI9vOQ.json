This place is phenomenal- the oxtail shabu broth is amazing, the service is amazing, all the food we ate (10 course set) was so good that we just made a reservation for the premium set next week. Phenomenal- don't miss out, you'll feel like you're in Japan",

        "caption": "Came here during their soft opening. We did not have a reservation. Greeter promptly seated us at the bar. Staff was professional and the food was on point. My wife and I each ordered the 10-Course Meal. The flavor and quality of the food is top notch. We will go back as many times as we can.  I humored the chef and said \u201cI never cared for Nabe until eating here\u201d. That\u2019s how great my experience was. Chef then said \u201cGlad we could bring you to the dark side\u201d. We had a good laugh.  Tips: Do make a reservation and be patient finding parking. There are several restaurants sharing the same parking lot. Come hungry!! Entrance is on King Street with a second story walk up. We spent a total time of two hours to enjoy the 10 courses. Enjoy each course but be prompt. They will be ready to serve your next course once you are finished. Bring your ID, they offer a wide selection of drinks. There\u2019s a washroom located in restaurant. It\u2019s a small-medium venue. Good comfy bar seating for one to two or tables to seat two to I suppose a dozen possibly. Staff speaks Japanese and English.  Enjoy!",
