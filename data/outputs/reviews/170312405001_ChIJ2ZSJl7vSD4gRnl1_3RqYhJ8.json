He even went the extra mile helping me surprise my girlfriend with some flowers and things I snuck in to him last minute and brought it out to surprise her at the end of dinner.

In fact, of all the sushi places in Chicago Runa is my absolute favorite due to that one Hybrid GTR maki roll..in my opinion.it is perfection as far as the balancing of textures and flavors go. mmmmm.  In general whenever Runa chefs fry tempura veggies to put into a maki roll it is  ALWAYS cooked/fried just right. It seems like whenever I go to other sushi spots often the tempura sweet potato is undercooked a bit, especially if they dont cut the chunks thin enough or on the other end of the spectrum it is so cooked and hot it has the texture of instant mashed potatoes...but I have never been disappointed by Runa.  Once I did bring a friend from out of town with me to Runa who's a real connoisseur when it comes to sushi and he was overly joyful and impressed while eating there, just kept ordering more and more things, seemed like a kid Christmas morning, said the fish quality was amazing.  Vwry recently they added late night hours...open til 2am now! So if i have a late night sushi craving then i can easily scratch that itch...10/10",

We stated your going to lose a customer over $9 he still didn't want to bend instead of apologizing and just taking a $9 lost he continue to explain the lost of the food not the customer lost. Smh then as we get up and not tip the waiter he had the nerve to chase us outside and ask for the sign receipt which we left on top of the table and stated why are you taking it out on me  he wanted a tip my exact words were $9.00 is your tip ask your manager for it.",

We also had the Negima Beef, teriyaki beef, rolled over an asparagus spear. This was also good, the asparagus was al dente, the way i like my veggies, and the beef was flavorful and tender. For our entrees, we both had some pieces of sushi and split a roll. The sushi was very fresh, the rice was not clumpy, but did not fall apart either upon dipping it in the soy sauce. We both enjoyed that very much. We shared a lobster maki roll. The lobster was tempura. While the roll was good, I would have preferred my lobster not be fried. The service was excellent, but we got there right after work, so there was not much of a crowd. Hard to really judge service when they only have a few people to wait on. Overall we enjoyed our dining experience and will dine there again.",

They have the best salmon in the city, hands down. The sashimi is perfectly colored and prepared-  bursting with flavor and ridiculously fresh. The spicy seafood miso has no comparison, featuring a generous variety of seafood ranging from whitefish and crab to mussels and squid. It's a great date spot, great casual dinner, great outdoor patio, great delivery service, great dine-in service, and its BYOB. Can't say enough good things.  The owner, Henry, is a sushi master and is very hands-on with the customers and the food preparation. He flies fresh fish in from Hawaii daily, which is part of the unique freshness a meal there holds.",

        "caption": "Ah, who doesn't love good traditional Japanese cuisine? When I found out there was an actual restaurant that served those big steamy buns near me I had to try it out! Delivery is where my heart is when it's a cold day in Chicago so of course I'll let the delivery guy traverse this weather while I sit and watch my favorite tv shows from the comfort of my home (although I do hope they make it out alive).  After waiting...and waiting...and waiting....my order finally came after about an hour and 45 minutes when its probably about 2 miles from me at the most. Busy day? Yeah I get it, but at least give me a call if its going to be almost 2 hours. Finally, I got my hands on some steamy hot buns, chicken fried rice and some OJ! I bite into them..lo and behold! They're pretty bland and the BBQ Pork ones hardly had any meat. Something was off though, they were way too chewy almost like chewing a napkin. I kept thinking, did they cook them too long or nuke these things in the microwave? Then I take a minute to study the buns.... there was a thick piece of transparent paper on the bottom of them (transparent from all the moisture I assume) that I was accidentally ingesting as well. I wish they would've given a heads up about the invisible wax paper on the bottom of their buns before I started chowing down.  Removing the paper doesn't help though, proving that even though you can make the buns like nice with almost perfect texture, you can't make piss poor ingredients taste good. At this point I still have hope for the fried rice so \"we'll see!!!\" I say to myself, \"I refuse to let the only Japanese restaurant near me be sub par!\"  Fried rice tasted like straight vegetable oil, I still think it was poisoned.  You cannot taste the chicken or anything except for the crappy oil that it was drenched in. Along with the delayed delivery did I mention the container of fried rice was broken in the bag so I had to do some shenanigans just to get most of it out of the bag, some of it spilled on my floor and in the bag itself. Strike two Runa, but still I have hope for you. You're Japanese, you have standards of excellence!  Washing down meals with a good drink is the equivalent of breathing so I reach for my juice in the bag. I keep reaching and fiddling around. Did they forget my drink?  NOPE, they ripped me off and give me a something which I can only assume was meant for an infant that I paid 3 bucks for. For those who need visuals I'll describe it as best as I can. Think of a small pill bottle for like aspirin, yep, that's the size of the $3 drink they sold me (which didn't state that it was going to be in a can by the way). At this point I feel totally ripped off especially when I could've gone to 7-Eleven and got like a liter of OJ for 3-4 bucks. I drank my shot in less than a second and immediately grabbed my camera to take pictures.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If you want good Japanese buns go to Wow Bao. The pork ones at Runa are huge, but as I said before they hardly have any meat whatsoever and are pretty bland.",
