I ordered the crabcakes eggrolls, crabcakes with lamb chops meal, lamb chops meal, and the warhead shrimp. The service and the overall process of ordering went great.  So this review is to first assure the buyer that papicuisine knows what to do with food. For the most part the flavor profile is there. Second is to let the owner know that you are not delivering a consistent product.  The crab cake was delicious and full of chunks of crabmeat and flavor.  The crabcakes eggrolls would have been perfect but were VERY SALTY. I couldnt eat them after one bite.  The lamb chop flavor profile was ON POINT delicious but they were over cooked and I have never in my life seen chops that small.  To be clear, they were so small that I would have needed about 10 chops to make up one portion of meat.  The mac-n-cheese was dry and flavorless but with a little finesse could be much better  The kale was good to me but it does have a twangy/sweet flavor but I liked it  The shrimp were very good also.  Overall I think that once the actual restaurant opens for in person dining I will try them again. I know they have the potential to be great and I want to be there for to taste the greatness.",

My food wasn't hot and I thought it would be being as though I still had to wait to get it. We always go to places based on reviews and just looking to try something knew. However, for me and my husband we weren't impressed at all. The food was blandly seasoned so we're still wondering what's all the hype about. We tried it like we said we would but it wasn't anything to write home about for us. We live an hour away from this location by the way,so we traveled to see what it was about.Hopefully others will enjoy when they visit.",

No one ever answers the phones there & you can\u2019t leave special instructions when making the reservation.  My wife finally got a reservation and we drove the 3 hours from NY for a date night. When we got there, we were a little shocked because we were apparently overdressed we thought we were going somewhere with some kind of up scale ambience and it was the opposite of that. Very small & quaint which I\u2019m usually a fan of because it\u2019s more intimate interactions much like NY but they weren\u2019t covid 19 compliant at all. It didn\u2019t much feel like the place for a date night but the place you go after dinner for a night cap. There were flies all over the establishment, table was wobbly, music was loud and explicit like a dive bar  The FOOD was AMAZING which is why they are even getting 2 stars from me. I got the stuffed lobster and jerk lamb chops and crab cake egg rolls and my wife got the stuffed salmon and warhead shrimp. As a foodie especially out of NY, it\u2019s GOOD food  Our waitress on the other hand who I think may have been amber or Ashley (she had locs) was unquestionably rude to my wife when she inquired about items on the menu, and she also appeared to be having a separate conversation on her headphones while taking our orders which was really odd. We later tried to grab her attention but she was standing at the bar taking shots with other customers so my wife attempted to get up to grab her attention & she came running over once she seen my wife walking over. I think she sensed our frustrations because she instantly became apologetic and brought us drinks on the house that we declined because our parking was almost up and just asked for our check...... someone at the bar asked her were we upset and she goes \u201cI get my tip regardless\u201d as If we didn\u2019t matter as patrons. I\u2019m a native New Yorker and we are living in pandemic times & I am in support of the auto gratuity on service industry tabs  but with this being my experience I\u2019m sorry my wife and I got so overly dressed , I\u2019m sorry I drove the 3 hours & im sorry I\u2019ll never dine in here again. avoid the flies, attitude & automatic gratuity and just DoorDash the takeout",

The crab inside didn't taste good either. I must say that the crab cake was decent and the warhead shrimp was the best item (nice size and flavor). The mac and cheese was stiff and left much to be desired. Again, we couldn't eat it. Lastly, 2 of my sides were missing...I did not receive them. That shows a lack of attention to detail. The ordering process was smooth and timely though. Overall, I was very excited to try this place but will not be returning. My at-home dinner date was a bust.

The staff states that they are closing early due to the pandemic, the staff at the restaurant told my cousin that they have been trying to call me all day but I have NO missed called from them besides the call from 9:53. There was no apology, no sympathy literally NOTHING! Naturally if someone had reservation for 20 mins or a month they should be contacted in advance. VERY horrible experience. I was not even offered a chance to come back the following day or anything. Extremely disappointed because I heard the food was really good and I wanted to support a black business and I don\u2019t want to bash anybody but this is ridiculous.",

During this time, at least 10 people came in for carry out orders, which seemed to be the restaurant's priority.  I wish I had known, I would have saved myself time and aggravation.  Then it took an additional 20 minutes to get refills on 2 waters.  I felt like an afterthought as I watched everyone at the bar and surrounding tables receive their drinks and food as I waited for a refill and I only got it once my husband flagged down the gentleman behind the bar.  The food was good as usual but I didn't feel the server had enough time to take care of us.  It seemed as though he was working everyone in the restaurant alone.  And to be clear, I was there at 4pm on 10/17 and not once did I see management jump in to help, even if it had been to check on guests or bring a few drinks to me or other customers.  The service issue I experienced is ultimately a management failure.  I want to support this black owned business but this was a lot to get over.",

I had heard great things about the crab cake egg rolls and I couldn\u2019t wait to go. My friend and I made reservations for 9:15 on Sept 11. We arrived a at 8:35 . We didn\u2019t mind waiting. Upon arrival my friend needed to use the restroom.  That is when I noticed a table by the bathroom. Then Lamar Jackson walked in , from that point on we were non existent. When my friend walked out of the bathroom. I told her hey that\u2019s Lamar Jackson from the Ravens. We went outside where we saw 3 tables , I went back inside to ask of we could be seated there . It was now 8:44 we were told no that they were for other reservations. All attention went to the football star like legitimately every staff member was focused on him. Finally at 9 we were seated outside at one of the 3 remaining tables that were still open since 8:44. We sat there from 9:00-9:13 without any water or silverware and a waiter that never came back. I get it a football star comes and that takes priority, but the remaining patrons should not be ignored. Needless to say we got up and left",

They honestly just tasted like some collards. Salmon bites and the shrimp were too good! I did provide more input on the adult slushy in a pineapple which was a new item as of 8/26/2020. Definitely make sure they put more alcohol into the mixed beverage because it can taste just like a regular slushy from 7-11. I'd highly recommend this place!",

I typically don't like to be hard on other businesses but when you give terrible service like I experienced, I feel compelled to share my review.  Me being a decade plus business owner, I honestly expected superb service for the prices . Not only did I have to wait nearly two hours beyond the website pickup time, it was pure chaos when i arrived at the restaurant. You're basically expected to stand around outdoors waiting for your order in a large crowd of upset guests that also anticipated timely service. There was also no parking whatsoever. So be prepared to walk several blocks and stand around waiting for your order.  In terms of the food, it does not look remotely close to his internet photos. A cup of soda cost $4. While I understand businesses have to make money, the prices are quite egregious for such poor quality food. The lobster was rubbery and very difficult to chew. The Asiago mashed potatoes would have been great if they weren't so cold. The wings were overcooked as if fhey were microwaved leftovers. The fries were cold most likely because the owner does not care enough to package the fries AFTER the other items are ready to be packaged rather than bagging the rest of my order and letting it sit until the lobster is ready.  The only pleasant thing about my visit was the security officer tried his best to help the restaurant get customers their order. He seemed empathetic and sincerely friendly with customers. I was very pleased with the security guard mannerism.  Based on my horrific experience, I am convinced the owner stopped caring about guest experience and only cares about the mondy now. Clearly he makes more than enough money to offer s better expected. I lost nearly $100 on absolute poor quality food. My conscience would not allow me to take guest money and not give them a better experience.  It pains me to see the owner really does not care evident by how his order system is set up for pay in advance. In other words, he ensures he is going to be paid because he knows the probability of order cancelation when guests arrive and see the dysfunction. Me being a business owner, I read between the lines and see the owner does not seem invested in giving guests a better experience. My son is also a west coast chef so I understand a lot about upscale dining and Papi Cuisine is not it. Maybe back in the day when he was an IG entrepreneur trying to build his clientele but definitely not now. He clearly let the hype kill his integrity!",

My guest also had The Hulk and she liked it.  Cons: we were inside dining and the flies unfortunately were coming in from outside and flying around our food. We were seated by a window and there were flies in the window that didn't make it back outside. With the restaurant being small inside. It was scary to see employees (2) security included walking back and forth with no mask or the mask not being worn properly and we're in the middle of a pandemic.there isn't much space between the aisle and the tables so the mask measure needs to be taken seriously.  We enjoyed ourselves and would definitely return. Hopefully these adjustments are made.",

We also added drinks for an additional $10 The Hulk and the strong island. Everything was DELICIOUS  Well worth every penny! The asparagus tastes as if it was marinaded in a lemon sauce, the salmon and lamb was seasoned to perfection. The salmon was stuffed with pure crabmeat, no filler at all. I did taste the fried lobster and the sauce as Guy would say you could put that on a flip flop and it would make it taste good. If you're on the fence, just try it! I couldn't even take pictures because I was so excited to try it! I will definitely be returning to continue to support.",

Papi Cuisine was far most one of the best food and service experiences that we have had. Ordering online was simple and easy, and when I did have a question and needed to reach out to the restaurant they were so gracious in answering. I received a text message that my food was ready for pickup within the time window that was projected to me at checkout. When I went to pickup my food, it was delivered to my car outside of the restaurant; streamlined, simple and easy. Lastly, the food was outstanding! it was so flavorful and the portion sizes were pretty hefty which allowed me to have lunch the next day. It is so refreshing to have restaurants like this in the Fells Point community that serve authentic soul food cuisine. We will be returning for both the experience and the food.",

Just make sure you make reservations (on open table) because you may have to wait much longer for seating (I found out the hard way). The hostess at the front door was AMAZING. She did her job very well and deserves employee of the month (bonus). Once seated the waiter brought water out and took our orders right away. The food came out quick, hot, and right. The potions were big and they give you a choice of three sides (yup 3 sides). The food was delicious!! So it was only right to order something to go. (Yup I sure did, don't judge me judge yourself for not eating there already. Lol) I HIGHLY recommend this place. By the way they do curbside pickups and takeout. My only complaint would be they close so early (7pm). The staff was super friendly. This place is for all. Family friendly because of the outside dinning.",

I placed an order at 4 pm and was told that it would be ready by 4:45 pm. It was not until 6 pm that I was informed that an item I ordered was no longer available even though I was told that they were getting more food AND I had already been waiting there since 5 pm. The woman working the front/carryout orders did not handle the situation well at all and gave us the run around the entire time. We did not get our food and WARM drinks until 6:30 pm. They didn\u2019t do anything to compensate for our time or inconvenience in any way. In addition to the long wait and lack of communication concerning the order, the food and presentation were both subpar. My \u201cstuffed\u201d salmon had the stuffing outside of the fish and the fried lobster was a joke. Beware.",

We had to make a reservation, which we did... when we got there we were seated within 2 minutes... the hostess was fast and friendly... she handled multiple tasking well... We sat at the bar...and the bartender was great our food was unbelievably amazing!!! They are great with social distancing and inside and outside dining nice and clean. There was a man that came and checked on us periodically as well to make sure that we were okay and didn't need anything!! That I can appreciate, our bartender took care of us, the fact that he still was helping assist was great!! The entire hour and 10 minutes we were there was great!! Definitely coming back!! #papiscusinerocks",

We sat at the bar. Drinks were really good. Food was good as well. The portions filled me up. I was not stuffed but I was full & was able to finish my plate with no left overs. Greens were slightly salty but they were still good. Mac and cheese was good although I wish it  were a little warmer. Stuffed lobster was good. Mashed potatoes were creamy & good. Waitresses were so nice and welcoming. Overall hospitality was great. Wish I was notified when I called at what time reservations were needed. Luckily there was 2 seats available at the bar. Hours on IG should be updated as well too. I will definitely be back !!",

Also you\u2019re told to not stand outside to wait and to come back.  They don\u2019t offer any printed menus- they insist you order through their website.  The fried fish I wanted was sold out and had to order salmon instead. Also they say you will get a text when food is ready, but the texts are not always sent.  Another customer said she got a text saying her food was ready but was informed the item was sold out when picking up her food.  I came back in 30 minutes and my food wasn\u2019t ready.  Then 15 minutes later they told me the salmon I ordered was sold out and I had to get lamb chops.  I waited another 20 minutes after modifying my order to receive my food.  The food tasted good but it was cold and not hot.  SO OVERALL IT TAKES OVER AN HOUR TO GET YOUR FOOD AND TGE WEBSITE DOESN\u2019T ALLOW FOR COMMENTS OR SUBSTITUTIONS.  The staff lacks professionalism and are in plain clothes.  They also don\u2019t serve people in a standard order- other people who arrived and ordered after I did received their food before me.  The employees kept running in and out of the kitchen shouting customer names through the side door.  Customers were lined up on the sidewalk and in the street.  It was utter chaos.  They need to work on their customer service.",

I arrive, of course it isn't ready yet. As I am waiting, I receive a text explaining that they are behind and they would call customers as orders became ready... kicker.... that was at 3:45... after I drove an hour to get here from DC. It is 5:30 and I just received my order. Keep in mind I have an hour to drive to get home. I asked TWICE for the drinks to not have ice because of the commute and melted ice ruins a cocktail. You guessed it, had to send those back because there was ice.  In total my order was 2.5 hours behind schedule. Unlike the other patrons, I couldn't go home and wait as I do not live in the area. Sat in the car the entire time watching others come and go with here food.  I would suggest they be more attentive to the patrons that are waiting in there view.  I will leave another review once I've tasted the food. I really do hope it was worth the day I just lost waiting for it.",

I let them know I had a table reservation & was seated right away.  I had to wait awhile for my 3 other guests to arrive but I still was constantly checked on, given a menu, and water while waiting. I also indulged in the Bottomless Mimosa. The vibe was great, smooth slow r&b music playing, was the perfect vibe for a beautiful Sunday! Let me add: The rest of the restaurant was full the entire time I was there! Once my party arrived we placed our orders. I got the Shrimp & Grits minus the crab and a side order of potatoes. I also ordered the Fried French toast!  Now listen: idk any restaurant that can compete with those shrimp & grits. The Smoked gouda Grits alone were so flavorful and creamy. The shrimp was cooked to perfection. The Fried French Toast reminded me of Funnel Cake and french toast and OMG it was soooo warm and yummy & good. Everyone at my table loved their food and had an amazing time. Not just my waitress, whose name was Amber, but everyone serving, was on it and was constantly moving.  The 1, 2 Henny punch was so light & refreshing yet packed a \"punch\". I appreciate a beautiful \"light\" cocktail, especially with dark liquor. The restaurant had a great vibe and you can tell everyone was enjoying themselves! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU come out and experience YOUR OWN experience at Papi Cuisine! Don't let the miserable people on this app make you miss out! Im giving 5 Stars! Keep up the amazing work!  Also allow time to find parking, it is fells point after all.",

        "caption": "Me leaving two stars may be a bit of a stretch but I\u2019m not going to completely bash an establishment by my people.  A friend of mine and I patronized this place this past Saturday and had 10pm reservations.  Upon arrival we still had to wait about 20 minutes or so to be seated.  I\u2019d say that\u2019s not completely abnormal and the host/bartender (man who wore many hats) was pretty nice about it and explained nicely that we would be seated when I inquired about what was taking so long.  He probably could\u2019ve offered a drink (not on the house of course) while guests are waiting past their expected reservation time.  Just a suggestion. After being seated we were greeted pretty quickly which was awesome.  Not in a friendly manner but we were acknowledged which is important.  I still couldn\u2019t tell you if the waitress had teeth or not because she didn\u2019t crack a smile one time while addressing us or any table as a matter of fact. We ordered drinks and appetizers.  My friend ordered some sort of margarita and I went with the old fashioned.  Then we ordered the shrimp appetizer.  Appetizer came out on time and then only one drink came out, the margarita.  I waited literally 45 minutes for the old fashioned.  This is all to be taken very literally because I am too in the service industry and am aware that timing is very important and people can also exaggerate when it comes to wait times.  I questioned this about 3x to my server and to the man who wore many hats.  He acknowledged that this wait time was ridiculous and even offered to take care of my old fashioned (which is part of doing good business).  I told him no thanks, just bring me the drink.  My friend was almost completely finished her drink at this time.  The bar wasn\u2019t even packed so it made nooooooooo sense to me.  You aren\u2019t supposed to serve incomplete tickets.  How do you bring a table one drink at a time and then have the other person wait 45 minutes for the other? Insane!  I still don\u2019t understand how that happened days later lol. So we finally ordered our entrees.  My friend did the stuffed salmon and I, the strawberry pecan spinach salad.  Again my friends\u2019s food came out first and my salad (which doesn\u2019t have to be cooked) only assembled was nowhere to be found.  Finally the incorrect salad came out 37 minutes later.  I still can\u2019t make sense off this because a salad does not need to be cooked and if you were picking what to send out first, the salad should\u2019ve won hands down. They then sent me a kale salad instead of spinach.  This is when the irritation really kicked in.  I explained this is not what I ordered and they looked at me as if I should still eat it.  I sent it back.  A kale pecan salad isn\u2019t even on the menu which I still don\u2019t understand how some made up salad made it to the table.  Finally the correct salad came out 3 minutes later. Again, sending out incomplete tickets is not a good look and it happened twice to me in particular. The man who wore many hats checked on us and explained that they were only 10 days old.  So it made sense things were happening the way they were but I still did not understand how things for the same table were coming out at drastically different times.  It\u2019s understood that as time progresses they\u2019ll figure it out and hopefully get everything out on time.  The front of the house staff should actually be taught some more hospitality as well.  That can help alleviate some of the untimeliness of the food/drinks in the mean time. I\u2019m willing to give this place about a month to get it together.  Hopefully they figure it out because they\u2019ll have some serious troubles if they don\u2019t.  Right now their performance is really bad for business.  I would not recommend this establishment to a friend at this very moment.  I\u2019m FOH and none of the experience made sense to me.  Oh yea and I stand corrected, the waitress does have teeth because she was nice after I gave her a 35% tip on the check.  That\u2019s when I figured out she had a personality at the end of the night.",

To expect patrons to wait 1 hour+ for food and to become combative and rude/unprofessional when questioned if this is typical. As we waited 1 hour past the reservation (which the set up of the restaurant was not conducive to) and another hour for food without anything as small as an apology from the owner/manager- Berry is totally unacceptable. I explained as we sat waiting for our food (at this point around 45 minutes) she has spent more time standing than serving drinks as a bartender. I suggested maybe for the busy time you should re-purpose her to run food, bus tables, greet at the front of the house and drop water off to tables waiting for servers. We had been waiting about an hour for food (during which a plate of French toast was dropped off to one person in the party) and had been there two hours total still without food. Lack of customer service, poor management, lack of utensils, extremely delayed food and inability to honor reservations. As a restaurant customer service should be your number one priority and ensuring your guest do not leave with a negative experience should play part in that. Chef Alex was apologetic and acknowledged the experience is not what he would expect to deliver via IG later. For that I am appreciative and that coupled with the service Amber was able to deliver earned the single star. So Berry Clark Jr instead of spending time being catty with women and responding to a singular negative post, spend more time practicing customer service and better writing skills. I'll say here what I would say in an email \" I wouldn't return is Jesus himself were cooking and serving food at your establishment\". Also: Who \"ask someone to leave\" and invites them back? Think on it?",

Some of my party only received part of their food and had to keep asking for the rest of it, which didn't come out until close to an hour after ordering. Another person ordered a drink and it took well over 30 minutes for her to get it, as someone sat behind the bar on his phone. Our waitress didn't seem interested in being there, we had to ask for utensils..it was like we had a first time waitress and it just got worse as time went on. There was one young lady bringing out food who was on it, but unfortunately was not our waitress.  Overall, if the food wasn't good I wouldn't return so I'm going to give them some time to work out the kinks and get adjusted to operating an actual restaurant.  Also, they might need to consider being more flexible with pricing and adding more options to the menu eventually. Hope they can improve.",

Reservations go fast, but if you walk-in the staff is super helpful and will do what they can to get you a seat. We came from out of town and the location of the restaurant is super cute.  Lots of shops in the area where you can stroll through after you eat.  We\u2019ll be coming back again when we\u2019re in town.",
