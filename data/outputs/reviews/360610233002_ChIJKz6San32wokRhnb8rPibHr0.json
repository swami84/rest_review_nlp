Will definitely revist.  Pros: -The person working was really nice. I say person cause he seemed like the owner, bartender, server.  He was everything. \ud83d\ude0a - food  was good.  It is made when ordered. It is also gluten free and fresh products - I normally hate outside eating, one reason the tables and chairs usually are bad and wobbly.  But they are using the inside tables and they were great. My 2 year old couldn't knock it over. - this is not a place for kids from what I see. But they had a kids cup. Not sure if it was off to the side or they offer kids cups. But he accommodated us. If I really wanted to get him something other than water, There are two corner stores/ bodegas/Deli right on the corner  In between: -The prices are decent, you get a lot of food. When we ordered the person warned us it was a lot of food. But I said bring it on anyway. - the burger looked small but it was thick. - the Arepas look small but you can get full off of one.  Cons: - we ordered margaritas and 1 sangria.  The margaritas were made poorly. Ice and tequila on the bottom and then the slush part on top.  It seemed like the margarita machine was running really low. So I assume he tried to make enough for 2. Which in this pandemic I understand . But he should have put slush on bottom and topped the tequila  to make it easier  to mix.  The sangria tasted like a wine spritzer with an orange in it, cause there was only an orange slice In it. Sangria would have been better if it at least had more fruits. Yet, it seems like he wasnt much of a bartender. He was the only one working besides the cook. - even the food was AWESOME it was a bit on the salty side.  SN: MENU IS NOT ON THE WEBSITE, CHECK THEIR INSTAGRAM @barepasnyc",

I live in the area and have walked by it every day since they opened a year ago and I'm so glad I finally stopped in!!! I went in on a cold sunday evening and was greeted by the owner who is extremely kind and very passionate about his craft. He reccommended the pork belly (that he hand selects himself from a butcher in upstate NY.) I started the night with the amanecida arepas and yucca fries which were AMAZING, also the presentation was phenomenal and quite unexpected. I ended the night getting the pork belly and I cant even explain how delicious it was. Its served on a bed of grilled aspargus, that are seasoned to perfection, the pork belly itself literally melted in my mouth, it was so juicy, flavorful, and savory, I coulnt get enough!! I have a feeling I found my new favorite spot in the heights! Will definitely be returning and reccomending to everyone in the neighborhood.",

Although they are still waiting to get the gas installed to expand the menu, what we ate was delicious. In another week they expect to be fully running. Mini cachapas with cheese and Pabellon Criollo were beyond my expectations. It was happy hour so there was a menu of selected wines and beer at a very decent price. Don't expect big portions, this is a tapas bar. Tapas inspired in traditional Venezuelan cuisine. It will certainly become one of our sure values in the neighborhood.  We returned a year later to celebrate a special birthday. We made a reservation for 20 guests. We had picked in advance the wine and the food we would be serving. The service was beyond excellent! The food was delicious, everybody loved it. We had a beautiful happy evening. Thank you Barepas!",

I spent a lot of time in France and Italy eating at places like this so...  I'm spoiled.  I just felt it needed a slight bit of flare in the flavor department. The food is fresh and warm but there are any number of ingredients that might be added, especially in a sauce or glaze to make some sort of salty, sweet, bitter, savory contrast or sparkle in the flavor.  The owners are Venezuelan I believe. Every country has it's goodies but not all are created equal. It's not unpatriotic tweak recipes or invent new ones. Wholesome but on the bland side is where it fell for me. Though not objectionably bland, fresh but little flavor. I know some caribbean cuisines are just like that but \u2014 The chef needs to pick and choose a bit from nouvelle cuisine.  The wines are good but not memorable. They might want to go to PJ's uptown and sample madly. Wine sellers often push so-so stock on new buyers.",

The Venezuelan touch adds a new mix to the area.  Many wines and a nice looking bar.  Will return for more.  As much as I want it to succeed I hope it does not turn into a loud mass mob joint like some of the places on Broadway.... Avoid serving burgers?  Music was nice but speaker was one low location and did not sound like good gear. Upgrade quality without making it louder?",
