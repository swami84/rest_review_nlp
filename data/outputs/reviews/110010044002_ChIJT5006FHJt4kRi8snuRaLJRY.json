Time management is not their forte. Lamb quesabirria was flavorful...and little too much lamb for my liking, though. I actually wanted to get the reg lamb birria tacos, but they were out. Esquites wasnt anything to write home about - tasted like they used frozen corn. Wild Shrooms tacos were so-so.  Tres leches was dry in the middle. Horchata was way too sweet - El Tamarindo's is better. Overall, a bit disappointing after all the hype. The one thing I did appreciate was that they give you the option to have things separated (deconstructed) so it doesn't get soggy. More places need to do this!",

Vegetarian eggplant Cemita (5/5) - One of the best sandwiches I've had! the scrumptious sandwich has a layer of crispy eggplant, melty oaxaca cheese, avocado, lettuce, onion, spicy aioli and pressed in a panini style sesame bun. While it sounds like a hodgepodge of ingredients, they work really well together with a spicy kick that's not too overpowering. Best of all? The sandwich is not messy and the toppings don't fall out!  My hubby enjoyed his DIY meaty steak carne tacos. It was hard to get the ratio of meat and garnishes right, so recommend just getting them preassembled!  The Aqua Frescos are fun to try! The creamy Horchata is like Rumchata, a cinnamon milky punch without the alcohol! It was too sweet and rich to drink on it own, and better as creamer for my coffee. The sweet Aqua Jamaica Hibiscus tastes like pomegranate juice and pairs really well with gin!  The Spicy Margarita has quite a kick!  I wasn't a big fan of the guac and chips. The chips don't taste fresh or homemade and the guac is super spicy.  Excited to come back for another Eggplant Cemita!",

I am here with a PSA. Whatever you decide to order, add 10-15 fresh tortillas and several 2 oz. containers of the salsas verde y morita. Xochi's handmade tortillas are the most authentic I've had north of the border and their salsas are delicious. Just add egg + bacon the next day for the best breakfast tacos around!",

We got the tacos deconstructed because we had to drive 30 minutes home before eating.  Although it kept the tortillas from getting soggy, it meant the tortillas were dry rather than having the rich juices of the filling adding to flavor.  The tacos were good not great. Especially for the price.  They are twice the price of my favorite taqueria in Edmonston.  Also, you have to order tacos in sets of three, which precludes trying more types unless you have a big group.  I usually can eat only three tacos at a sitting and i like them to be three different kinds. The staff are super hard working, efficient, and friendly. Ordering online and picking up when texted was a breeze.",

You're getting good, fresh food so the wait is well worth the wait.
