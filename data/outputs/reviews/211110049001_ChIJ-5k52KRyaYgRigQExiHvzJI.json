Our online order through Grubhub wasn\u2019t prepared and had to wait an additional 30 mins for our order to be prepared in store upon our pickup arrival time. Our order consisted of.  1. Crispy Chicken Mushroom smch 2. Mushroom Swish burger 3. Garlic n olive oil tots 4. Coffee milk shake 5. Vanilla milk shake 6. Haystack fry\u2019s  Shakes were half full. The haystack fries looked sad n soggy. ONLY RECEIVED ONE SAMICH! And it sat in Passover window for 10mins before being given to me resulting in our food being cold.  The manager or \u201cacting\u201d general manager Justin did nothing.",

Adding: I got my food before the lady that was in front of me. I was almost done eating and I asked did she have a big order and all she ordered was one burger. On her behalf I asked to speak to the manager who immediately got with her crew to get  started on her order. Poor girl missed her bus and was late for work over this. Hope they compensate her.",

Informed whom I believed to be the manager (in a red shirt), who said she'd fix it in a minute but never saw her again. Server brought part of our order, said he'd be right back with the rest but stayed up front talking instead.  When I asked a worker passing by if we could get the fries we'd paid for, she acted like we were lying and demanded to see the receipt. I showed her and she still wasn't quite believing me. Saving grace was the fry cook, who came out, apologized and brought us our fries.  Never eating there again, and if you're in a hurry go someplace else.",

When we opened the bag, every burger was completely demolished and there was sauce covering the bag and wrappers. We couldn't even distinguish who's was whose because they basically just put whatever they wanted to on them. None of the toppings were correct and each burger was covered in sauces to the point you couldn't even hardly hold them. I called back and spoke to a manager, Laura, and she basically didn't care and said we could try to get reimbursed from DoorDash and that she \"doesn't even know what was supposed to be on them because she didn't see them being made\". She offered no resolution or seemed even concerned that they were putting food out in that quality. I love Smashburger normally, but I would definitely would save your money from this location and use it somewhere else that actually cares what condition they are serving food to the customers in.",

My most recent visit, there was only 1 cashier waiting on a line going out of the door. While there were about 4 to 5 employees in the back (grill area) talking or hanging out. It was so bad that the lone cashier was complaining to customers and the customers were standing up for her. I saw this one lady address the group and their practices of having 1 cashier during a lunch rush. However, the employees just went to the back where they could not be seen. Many of the customers were frustrated but this should be addressed from upper management. I'm highly disappointed.",

The next day there was a sign that they had run out of meat. How does a burger joint run out of meat?? Lack of planning! Whoever is in charge of inventory definitely needs to monitor when there will be large events at the convention center, especially over a holiday weekend. Given the location, the holiday weekend and multiple large events in town for that weekend within close proximity, the ball was definitely dropped here. Others from our group tried to visit over the course of the weekend and had issues as well.",

While waiting in line I noticed 3 people coming up to the counter because their orders were not delivered or were wrong. On to the food. All I can say is, meh. It was okay. Five Guys is much better. Had a smashburger and smash fries. It was very mediocre. I expected more for the price. Delivery from the kitchen to the table was slow but I did get to interact with a vagrant who came in asking patrons for money. Nice. I wont go back to this or any smashburger.",

The food was not even close to the quality for the money paid. The restaurant was dirty and no one seemed to have a clue where food needed to be taken.

Went to my first Smashburger on March 12, 2019 before the Kiss concert at the KFC Yum center thinking a quick bite to eat would hold me over until after the show since I wasn't wanting to spend a fortune at the center .  I was really disappointed to say the least .  I've tried coming up with a reason to give them three stars or better but honestly could not .  Our bad experience started right as soon as we entered the store .  The cashier was absolutely clueless as to what he was doing and could not understand the simplest of questions which led to our order being completely messed up .  When we tried to get it straightened out this young man had no idea what we were trying to get across to him no matter how simple we tried making it for him .  Next they also had the young man taking orders and getting them out to customers which made a wait of over 20 minutes for two simple burgers and tater tots .  The food was really lack luster at best, more like burnt, but we ate it not wanting to spend more time trying to have them redo the order since that would have clearly caused that young cashier to have a melt down in understanding .  When given the choice in the future between Smashburger or Five Guys, my choice will clearly be with Five Guys .",

I ordered a turkey burger, a triple double burger and smash fries. Upon picking up my food I had to wait 10 minutes additional. When I received my food I was missing the turkey burger. So that made me wait even longer. When I get back to my job I open the Turkey burger and it has nothing on it but smash sauce and to top it off it was supposed to be a double and the second pattie was beef that looked like it had been dropped and put it back together again. I walk all the way back to the restaurant and was never greeted. Stood there another 10 minutes until I had to ask for assistance. The Manager was currently arguing with another disgruntled customer. The Manager did aplolgize for the screw up on my order and offered to fix the order again but there was no way I was waiting another 20 minutes for my food. I requested a refund. Not to mention with all the back and forth I lost my appetite and was thoroughly disappointed. You would think being downtown Louisville across the street from the Convention Center they'd be better equipped to handle large crowds and have better service. Wont be going back to this location.

Over the last few years this has been one of the few places we stop by to grab a quick bite to eat. Well, this recent trip we decided to stop at this location to take a bite to eat before a party. When my family first walked in the restaurant a young lady at the counter did not even acknowledge us because she and another worker was too busy running their mouth. After a few minutes of standing in line; when there were no customers, she finally took our order. My family took our seats and begin chatting it up with other family members who work in and/or around the area on 4 Street. I start to notice more people coming in ten minutes after my family took our seats; and you can tell they were starting to pick up a little more. Fifteen minutes past after we took our seats and one of the worker\u2019s came over with my sister\u2019s order; which was a Smashburger (lettuce, cheese and tomatoes) with fries.  She begins to eat it. A little more time went on and I realized my food has not come out yet. I look in the back and I see the same young lady who took our order eating back in the kitchen. A young man came over and said my food will be out shortly. Ten more minutes went by and still there was no food I had ordered but somehow all those who ordered after me had received their food. I turned around at my sister to ask her a question; she looks at her burger and squint her eyes. I asked her what was wrong and she took her two fingers and pulls out a long strand of dark hair from between the cheese and burger! Mind you she has bright red hair! We told the worker, he stated he was sorry and said he will make another one for her to go. My food still wasn\u2019t out to my table by this time. I go back up to the register and asked for my money back and the young man who have been dealing with us goes to get the manager; who was looking unconcerned. I spoke to him about how long I\u2019ve been waiting and I will take my money and service elsewhere. He said he was \u201csorry and didn\u2019t know what was going on and that I had ordered\u201d Mind you he been glancing at me for almost an hour when I was there. My aunt leaned over and the young lady who took our order, eating while fixing the food; looks at my aunt and said she is sorry and she \u201cforgot\u201d; and my sister never got a burger to go! DO NOT go to this location!",

        "caption": "Absolutely the worst burger experience. It's a little cliche but I wish I can give it negative stars. To preface, I wanted to eat here while at the Supercon event because of the positive experience I had at the Smash Burger in the airport.  The experience here was bad from the start when I ordered a burger and it didn't come out as expected. I paid for cheese and extra fixings but got a plain burger. The experience only gets worse from here.  The food here fell way short of expectation. The fried pickles were so salty I may as well have chewed on salt; it also did not come with ranch dressing as indicated on the menu. The burger was sloppily thrown together and the beef patty seemed to be marinated in salt. Surprisingly, the fries weren't salted (or maybe the pickles and burger were so salty I couldn't hardly taste anything after). The fries were also terrible as they were more of a rubbery chew than having a crisp crunch expected of thin cut fries.  The tables were dirty, the bathrooms were nasty with no paper towels and pee all over the toilet seat.  Do yourself a favor and save your money. You're better off going to a corner store and pour salt down your throat... At least you won't be as sorely disappointed and save some loot in the process.  On a side note. I did not ask for them to remake my order since they got it wrong. Judging from the place, I did not want them to wipe the burger on their a$$ before serving it to me albeit it probably would have made it taste better.",
