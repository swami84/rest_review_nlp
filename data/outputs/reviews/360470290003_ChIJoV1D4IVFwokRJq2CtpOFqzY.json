He lied and didn\u2019t want to make the order because of the high volume of calls and orders he must have gotten. I was very disappointed. If they are not taking orders the food delivery pages shouldn\u2019t have their restaurant listed on it. He didn\u2019t want to cancel the order and have the customer waiting thinking they are going to receive the order. Good thing I called to confirm otherwise I would have been waiting.

The wings are still great! Glad the quality of those didn't drop, but if there's a drop in quality in the fries due to the whole covid situation I wish that was told up front because I would just have not paid for the fries, they were awful. I guess if you're planning on ordering here just know that the fries have been changed and to not expect what's in the other reviews. $35 for two 7pc and three fries, when the fries look like frozen bag ones, really wasn't worth it. Should just stick to wings for now until it gets sorted out.",

It\u2019s been such a long time since I\u2019ve had great wings and of course being someone that strictly eats halal I\u2019m limited to places where I\u2019d be able to get wings but this by far beat all expectations. I\u2019ve had wings from many different places, not just in Brooklyn but in other states as well. This hit the top of my list. Great sized wings and the boneless wings were actual chicken. Actual FRESH chicken. Nothing was frozen! It sounds like a joke when you say that the boneless wings were \u201cactual chicken\u201d but unfortunately I\u2019ve had boneless wings that were actually nuggets from 95% of the places I\u2019ve gone to. You have to try this for yourself to understand how great this is. Their customer base is very diverse and if you\u2019re in nyc this is definitely worth making a trip to Brooklyn for.  They have a ton of options for their sauces as well - this was another unique factor. You guys have earned me as a repeat customer not only for the outstanding quality of the food but also the superb hospitality and customer service. I alongside my friend both felt welcomed from the moment I walked in. We were greeted with respect and I was given two pieces of the boneless wings to try them. This was of course after I told the person behind the register why I don\u2019t go for boneless wings.  Thank you for a great experience, we absolutely loved it! I wish I had taken more pictures before digging in to the food.",

It's amazing how many people go inside your store and they just see you as a customer but for him it felt like he deeply cared. Not only for me but many of the customers are experienced the same thing  When I left he didn't ask for anything just waved have a good day and at that time it deeply touched my heart.

Called the place to inquire on where it was and was told by the employee they didn\u2019t even make it yet. Gotta be kidding me. They said they would begin making the order, should be done in an hour and a half. Mind you they told me I need to leave my own party to come pick it up.

I have ordered and stopped by to pick up and both experiences were great.  The staff is very friendly and nice. They are patient and knowledgeable with what they have. I have seen them answer questions for customers who have never had wings or sauces like this and offer a tasting of the sauces.  The wings were super delicious, definitely not cheap freezer bag wings from a store. The sauces are amazing. I have so far only tried the Sriracha honey (spicy with a hint of sweetness), Garlic Parmesan, Honey Mustard and Sweet and Sour. All the sauces are delicious. They have a lot of sauce choices which is a good thing and there is a flavor for everyone to enjoy.  I would highly recommend the twisted combo because it comes with blue cheese, carrots/ celery, fries (that taste great, even without ketchup), wings and can of soda.  Glad to have something like this place in this neighborhood and recommend everyone check them out!",

        "caption": "My wife and I went to the soft opening of Twisted Wings on 11/19/2019. Even though they haven't officially opened yet, we were greeted warmly if not enthusiastically and everything was in order and ready to go. My wife, who has a food handlers certificate, noticed that each sauce had it's own separate pair of tongs, so someone there knows about safe food preparation. I ordered the naked Sweet Thai Chile and my wife had the naked Honey Honey. The wings were big, meaty and fried perfectly. The Sweet Thai Chile was pleasantly but not insanely hot with just the right amount of sweetness and the sauce made a nice glaze. The Honey Honey was sweet with a nice mustard tang.  It took more than twenty minutes to get the order out but I'm going to chalk that up to inexperience. I have no doubt that they'll find their groove and speed up. We're definitely coming back.",
