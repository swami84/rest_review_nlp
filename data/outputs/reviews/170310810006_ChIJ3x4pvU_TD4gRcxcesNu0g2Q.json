        "caption": "Horrible. I was in a slight rush because I had to get to work so I came into this location on October 27th at 5:16 pm. Bad idea. I come in and the cashier is typing away on the POS for literally 5 minutes. Don\u2019t even know what he was doing because the customer in front of him who was waiting for a pick up order hadn\u2019t even been talked to yet. Then I overhead him tell the man in front of me that food would take 10 minutes even though the store was empty.  I had been in there maybe once or twice prior and the cashiers were always very helpful when I had questions about the spices and how hot they were. I have even been given samples of the sauces. When I asked the man what would the eta for food would be (since I was in a slight rush, had to get to work) he said he didn\u2019t know. Then as I tried to ask more questions on the time he begrudgingly said it would depend on what I wanted (with a rude tone, as if he was annoyed I was asking questions). I then asked what if I just wanted a small portion, like 6 wings, still an unclear answer.  Then I proceeded to ask him about the Louisiana rub flavor. It was listed one step above the mild on their scale so I asked if it was a little spicier than mild. He rudely said he didn\u2019t know. What does the guy know? I don\u2019t know if he was high or what but as an employee you\u2019re supposed to know your product. I asked him basic questions and he answered with nonchalance and indifference. It was very rude. As an employee you should know the menu and also what\u2019s going on in he kitchen. I work in hospitality myself. As I had said before I had gotten detailed explanations from staff and I hadn\u2019t been in the restaurant for a long time so I needed a reminder.  To make matters WORSE, I\u2019m originally from New York and I talk with my hands and I\u2019m a short woman only 5\u20193. When I was referencing things on the menu I pointed to them. Not even fully extended. This rude boy had the AUDACITY to cut me off and tell me not to put \u201cmy hands in his face\u201d.... my hands were nowhere near his sulky face. We were separated by counter and the POS and he was much taller Than me. Impossible. It was rude and embarrassing when there was another guest behind me. He was just looking for an excuse to argue since from the very top of the conversation he was rude. I never yelled at the man and I don\u2019t care if he didn\u2019t like my tone I\u2019m the customer. He should remain poised and polite the whole time. Mind you I was irritated because he was an idiot who wasn\u2019t even trying to answer my questions. And also, I don\u2019t understand why wings have such a long eta were they playing around in the kitchen? There was no explanation.  I told him I no longer wanted food from this establishment because of his attitude and I gathered my things to leave. I asked for his name and He most likely gave me a fake one he said his name was \u201cCharles\u201d and he was a taller African-American man maybe in late 20s to early 30s in a red and grey north face fleece. I will be reaching out to a manager about this as well as corporate. When there isn\u2019t any management around employees think they can talk to customers any kind of way which negatively effects business. I most likely will never come back to this location which is a shame considering the face I just moved around the corner. Management get ride of \u201cCharles!\u201d",
