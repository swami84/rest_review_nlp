I realized when I walked in that it would of have been better to preorder my food via their website because it was such a long wait and there weren't that many customers online. I know, I know COVID precautions. The 2 servers were doing their best  to fill incoming orders from online & in person but they were slow. Let me tell there is not one hint of attitude from these ladies (how rare is that in a Harlem restaurant). That earns a 2 star rating in itself.  One person came in after I did after about 3 minutes, she turned around and left. I finally place my order for the chicken bowl and the fried fish bowl.  It took a while to prepare but finally the server walked over to the area where I waiting to hand off my order.  I tried the Fried fish bowl first, the fish was packed in a sleeve away from the food (I guess to keep it from being soggy). I added to the bowl and reheated my meal in the microwave. The fish is seasoned a bit too heavy for my taste buds (I don't consume alot of salt). I didn't care for the cornmeal batter either, it was a bit gritty. The rice was good, well cooked but it had some veggies in there I don't eat like brussel sprouts. Brussel sprouts are not common vegetables in my Caribbean/Southern upbringing but I did it  eat it (not too bad). *shrugs* Overall, I wouldn't order the fish again (the seasoning/batter).  I will try the chicken bowl tonight. The restaurant is a medium sized clean and modern space but obviously no is dining in. I would definitely go back to order (pre-order) the veggie bowl and maybe try something else on the menu.",

I settled on the salmon black rice bowl.  Initially, I thought the bowls were on the small side but I soon changed my opinion.  It was heavy and packed right.  Salmon cooked perfect and not overcooked or dry.  I will definitely come back and probably try the shrimp green curry bowl next.",

Its my new weekly favorite! For those who can't device, they have half bowls so you can sample multiple types.

In general, I\u2019m a little wary of \u201cglobally inspired\u201d food, but I found all the bowls to be pretty faithful with the cultures they were inspired by. They were not necessarily pitch-perfectly matching a traditional dish, but definitely providing an honest take, and not caricaturing.  The fried fish with homemade tartar sauce was definitely a highlight: crispy, soft, and tangy. The shrimp was well-seasoned and tender, as was the beef. I wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic about the jerk chicken sauce, but it wasn\u2019t bad.  Of course, all the rice was perfectly cooked, soft without being mushy, a flavorful addition to the meal in its own right and not just a plain canvas. And the greens! Somehow, all the brussels sprouts were crispy, the pieces of broccoli cooked through but still crunchy, and the collard greens stewed until soft.  Of the sides, I enjoyed the quinoa bun bao the most. Usually, I think vegetarian versions of meat dishes are only pale imitations, but these buns were little punchy celebrations of flavor that made me not miss having meat at all.  This is food any restaurant should be proud to serve, done in a friendly, fast-casual setting.",

Shrimp (GF) Sticky rice, toasted coconut, green curry sauce -fresh shrimp, and sticky rice was little sweet with coconut flavor. Very similar to Thai's mango sticky rice. But green curry version. And lots of vegetables  as well!  Salmon (GF) (DF) China black rice, pineapple edamame, piri piri sauce - salmon was very tender and soft. I was surprised they use black rice. It gave more texture. And lots of vegetables in the bowl as well! Feel healthy:)  Yucca puff (GF) (V) - vegetarian version of shrimp cracker. It's my first time had yucca puff! I love it. Very crispy, with hint of sweet and salt. Yummmmy  Crab pockets (SFA) Garlic herbed cream cheese, sweet & sour sauce - crispy skin outside, and full of crab meat inside, with cream cheese.  Dragonfruit lemonade - super refreshing!",

Mushy mixed vegetables that are supposed to have broccoli and greens but have only broccoli stems and green stems, clumpy, poorly prepared\u2014bland\u2014rice, and small quantities of food atop the rice.  I will say that the three shrimp I. The \u201cshrimp bowl\u201d (yes that\u2019s accurate, 3) were well prepared, as was the more generous portion of braised beef.
