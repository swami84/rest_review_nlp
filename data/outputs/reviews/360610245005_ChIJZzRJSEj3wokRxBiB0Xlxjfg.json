The name is a little deceptive.  There is much chicken to be had and certainly you can get fried chicken any part or combination of parts.  The food on average is very good.  They have a Spanish we server you type buffet and the servings are better than their competition. I will be keeping an eye on this.  Their $5 lunch deal is a good deal, on a budget, i'd recommend it.  The pastelitos are home made sometimes right in front of you and they are well packed.  Not the cheap frozen ones you get from the nearby competition.  Their drink selection is lackluster but I think these guys opened as soon as they could reasonably start making some sales.  Sales, they do.  It's never superpacked but you don't have to worry about old food here.  All the buffet options are cleared out every 2 or 3 hours by the customers.  I ate here for a week straight and started getting a little concerned about the salt intake so i'm going to chill for a while.  Very tasty though.",
