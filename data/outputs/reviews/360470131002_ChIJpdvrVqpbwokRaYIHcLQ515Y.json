Extremely overcomes, half the taquitos weren\u2019t even edible, they came out crunchier than tortilla chips, and the meat inside was grossly overcooked and inedible. For $10 and for only 4 of these, which only half was edible, is ridiculous. Lastly, the beef chorizo quesadilla was actually tasty. Definitely wouldn\u2019t come back.

They even freaked me out more by saying that their rice and beans are COOKED with onions - so they have nothing to do about it. What should I have done? I was already late to work and I got super mad and I stormed out (without breaking the door as they mentioned, which is nothing but a complete lie).I apparently now know why in this country, suing people and corporations really worth it.

The conservation consist of me saying \"can I Please have the corn\",Daniel said that grub hub promoted it and I was supposed to order the corn and It would have been deducted off the bill. So I asked \"if I could have the corn, my children wanted it that's why I ordered the amount\" he said \"no!!! I should ask grub hub, they are a million dollar company and I should ask them\" I asked if I could walk to the restaurant to get corn (i would have paid for it) he said \"NO\" then I said \"I will not order from them ever again\" he went nuts screaming at me. I was trying to tell him about communication, because I wrote a note on the delivery details saying \"please don't forget to bring my free corn\". But he was screaming about small businesses and he doesn't care about me. I was so up set and in tears I said \"who the F are you to treat me like this\" he could not have screamed any louder Goodbye!!!over and  over until he slammed the phone down... I saved our burrito for dinner, Now 8pm here we are eating and my little boy bites down on hard pice of broken resin plastic inside of the burrito... I dont dare call back... please be very careful and weary.... I support small businesses all the way just not vulgar, careless, dirty ones",

I'm currently a breastfeeding mom and need to be soy and dairy free due to the baby's allergies and Daniel was so accommodating walking me through the menu and then personally guaranteeing he'd oversee our order.  This kind of service, especially in stressful times like these, is SO appreciated.  Please order through their website so they get all the profits, plus you get 10% off your first order and 5% off every order after that (this is not an ad, I swear, I just want to make sure good businesses keep getting business right now).  It's so hard to find soy and dairy free delivery right now and I just can't handle making dinner on my own every night.  So, from the bottom of my heart, thank you Daniel and the staff of of Maya Taqueria Park Slope.  Now I'm going to go and reheat the extra tamales I ordered!",

I had to repeat all of my information to the girl three times which is fine, annoying but ok. I asked for the different sauces on the side. She said to make up for the delay she would  include all the sauces. In reality I thought that this was a given but I thanked her. The burrito came it took almost an hour when she said it would take 20 mins. Unlike the prospect heights location the  ingredients did not taste fresh and the burrito fell apart within seconds , it was gross. Also they didn\u2019t give me a single sauce.  I guess this restaurants  management and quality has really gone down, what a shame.",

The service seems to be much faster on takeout customers and that's ok. Just don't make it look like a restaurant if it isn't and carter only to pre-orders.

Sadly this second location isn't nearly as good as the original location. We've ordered from here many times and the food has always been inconsistent some days being good and other days not, or they mess up our order when we pick it up. Their guacamole and chips was a staple item we always got in Prospect Heights, but this Park Slope one lacks flavor a lot, or is watery. The beef has been pretty fatty lately (by that I mean chunks of fat on the meat) and the rice mushy.  I keep going hoping for better food that they'd have their footing by now, but no more. I'd say people should go to the original location on Vanderbilt. Way better than this location.",

        "caption": "Ordered online and got an email saying order would be ready at 7:43pm. When we arrived, it was not ready, no worries. Waited around as all the people who placed order after us got their food. Obviously, our order was never started until we asked for it at the time of pick up. We even tried to call to make sure they got our order but of course their phone number was also not in service. Not sure how you open for business without a working phone number. When we finally got our food, there was no guac in the burrito as ordered. Food quality is meh. We live right around the corner too. If it was good, we would have been a regular. Too bad. Never going back.  Especially when there is Oaxaca right on 4th Ave which has comparably much better mexican food, not to mention the taco truck on Union st.",
