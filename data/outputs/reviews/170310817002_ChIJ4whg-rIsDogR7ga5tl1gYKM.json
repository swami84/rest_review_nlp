I considered in 2002 this place as best in America in overall for aged stakes . Not for from famous Magnificent Mile Area . Chicago is not known only  for its notorious Chicago Fire and As center for Mafia in prohibition Era. In 1893 it held So called Chicago Columbian Expo Fair commemorating 400 years of C Colombus rediscovery of New World and America's . On shores Michigan there is still remnants of that Era reflected in it's Cultural Museums. Chicago still is second only to NY as having a Downtown type  lifestyle. High rise construction started here first rep in Flatiron building. It is always warm and lots of things to do in the Windy City.   RZED.",

Within 30 minutes we walked over to the chophouse and had our table ready. We had Janae as our waitress and I\u2019m so glad we did because she made our whole experience. You know I\u2019m not really that big into spending money on food because at the end of the day it\u2019s going to be eaten and last for only an hour at max. Janae went through the entire dry vs wet steak and we decided to go big or home so we went for the tomahawk steak and I do not regret it at all. The size of the tomahawk and the texture was incredible. I can\u2019t even really put it into words on how good it was.  Just go to chophouse and get the tomahawk if you\u2019re into dry aged. If not then idk what you\u2019re doing. Oh we also got a side of the bacon cheddar mashed potatoes but we devoured the steaks that we didn\u2019t have room for the sides.",

I didn\u2019t have any problems with my table or wait for a table. B. The food was excellent. Best steak and seafood I\u2019ve had.  And C. Saved the best for last here, Hector was an OUTSTANDING waiter. His section was outside in the tent. People kept getting seated out there and moving back into the restaurant because they were too cold. We actually felt bad for the servers that were out there. But let me tell you, Hector is a true professional. Great attitude and top notch service. In fact, it was the best service we\u2019ve had in a long time. The busboy was very efficient too. The whole staff all seemed to being doing their best. I give them all a lot of credit. We will definitely be returning.",

It was freezing outside. 30 degrees \ud83e\udd76. Propane heaters and propane blast heaters were all they had to keep us warm and it was not enough for the weather. For what we payed this was not acceptable. I know, we could've canceled and went somewhere else but we were in town for a short time. And nothing wise was any better. At least we were able to sit down and eat a meal as a family. I was very disappointed. Listen, It was so cold, that a couple next to me, my wife and daughter asked for the heat to be directly on them. Cause the man's feet was freezing. Lol, they put the heat right on his feet. Lmao, this experience was crazy to say the least but I get it. What can they do? Otherwise it was a great meal. We made the best of it and went back to our hotel \ud83d\ude44 Definitely will visit when the times get better.",

Gross. - Disgusting French onion soup - Tables were sat very close, even during COVID. The dinning room was basically empty on one side and crowded on the other - Very salty food - as if we were eating at McDonalds next door  There were a few good things: the service was great. The dessert (crepe br\u00fbl\u00e9e) was delicious, and the lamb chops were cooked perfectly.  I will not return or provide a recommendation for anyone to visit here.",

If you\u2019re currently searching these reviews to figure if you should eat here or not, I beg you to listen to someone with tastebuds and give this place a HARD pass. My boyfriend and I made reservations well in advance and as we arrive are left standing at the front for 15 mins as the hostess let others in before us, mind you we also asked for patio AND told them to make special note it was for a birthday dinner, which was not even acknowledges, was seated upstairs even after we told her we asked for patio. Was seated and it took up to 15 mins to even be acknowledged. Got our drinks that were EXTREMELY watered down which is just sad/ embarrassing for an upscale restaurant. French onion soup was served to us with half the soup and cheese covering the outside of the bowl as well as the cheese being almost rock hard. We then order a grand filet and a salmon, which are both very pricey and would not mind paying for good food, however without even taking the first bite, visually we were already disgusted. As I was eating the salmon, i picked THREE bones out of my mouth... classless. There was water and oil all over our plates, not even wiped. Again usually things like this are not a big deal, but an expensive restaurant like this should not have food coming out like a kirbys Coney Island. The steak and salmon ABSOLUTELY lacked any sort of seasoning to the point it was laughable. I asked for salt and pepper and was given salt and pepper PACKETS.... we also ordered mashed potatoes that were extremely cold when at our table and legit just had paprika on the top, nothing else. I would rather eat instant potatoes than that sad dish. We told our waiter about them and was given an odd look and response of \u201c...cold?\u201d Like we were lying. Overall i was EXTREMELY disappointed with not only the food, the service, but also the VALET! They had ONE man who was whipping the cars down the road, leaving crowds of us to wait 20 mins for our cars. If you are a old couple with no tastebuds, be my guest, other than that...need I say more about this sad establishment?",

After being seated for 15 minutes still no sign of the server we had to flag someone down to get served. We ordered the wet aged tomahawk steak and the charred salmon and with many other sides including mash potatoes and French onion soup, the food was one of the worst I have ever had which I prefer going to a Coney Island and paying 1/4 of the price I payed here. The steak was dry and our salmon had bones and was not charred, including the Mash potatoes which had just paprika and was cold. When acknowledging the server about the situation he gave us the dirty look and said no it\u2019s not, so I asked for my check and went out to eat at maple and ash where they provided excellent service. To top it all off the valet driver which was handled by one person on a Saturday night!! It took almost 30 min to bring our car. Don\u2019t waste your time and MONEY.",

While the meat products are clearly of a high caliber (I strongly recommend either the Tomahawk Ribeye or the Petite NY Strip), it was the side dishes that really sealed the deal for me.  Be certain to try the truffle mac and cheese, steamed spinach, or any of the seafood options should you visit the Chop House!",

As a New Englander I should have known better than order lobster in Chicago. Steak was cooked perfect - black and blue - which many places get wrong. Service was good but felt a but pushy. Kind of used car salesman type of behavior. Atmosphere isn't romantic but is casual and relaxing.

We get water right away but had a lengthy wait for drinks.  It was an hour before we asked the manager if we could please order at least an appetizer.  The appetizers arrived and were disappointing.  The $24 charcuterie board had 3 pieces of bread,  3 pieces of meat and perhaps 3 oz of cheese along with a couple strawberries, raspberries and perhaps 10 blueberries.  Maybe $7 worth of food.  I ordered the dry aged porterhouse prepared medium, it was served rare so I sent it back and when it was returned it was tough and dry.  But after waiting an hour and 45 minutes, I just ate it.  The sides were good but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this meal.  I have been here before and had a fantastic meal.  I'm not sure what happened but i hope it was a fluke and not the new norm.  No one at the table had a great meal which is disappointing and unacceptable for a $$$$ establishment.",

The steak we ordered (dry aged tomahawk) was under cooked and rather send it back, we opted to take the remaining meat home to further cook thoroughly. They took our food to box it, but during the process they tossed the raw pieces into the garbage (about 1/3 of the steak) and gave us back the remaining. We politely asked the server where the remaining of the steak was. They were unsure and had the manager talk to us. She (the manager) accused us of lying after she 'investigated' the situation. She refused to be accommodating and honestly didn't want to help or address the situation. At one point, she went to further investigate with the staff and never returned.  AVOID this steak house! Go to Gibsons, Benny's, Mastros, even outback steak house will provide a more pleasant experience!",

On the other hand, as an out-of-towner who ordered there by mistake (thought they were the grill chop house across from my hotel on w monroe), and who struggled to rush to the place my cab to pickup my prime rib and massive potato, I am very pleased.  Yes, it was an expensive meal. I'd argue that's a side effect of real estate prices in this city (maybe?), but I saw the menu and ordered for pickup anyway. The food was really done right (I'm super picky about my steaks) and warm in spite of the 7 or 8 blocks in traffic each direction via cab.  Bonus: I didn't know but they have a house car and will come and pick you up. They treat you like royalty and make you feel good about the $50-$75/person meal (before drinks and tips). If the price isn't an issue, I think you'll be thankful for the meal.  :)  Update June 2019: I went back to Chicago Chop House, and I think it may just be a regular stop for my trips to the city going forward. The staff is very friendly and in my last visit while waiting for my order (to go), we had a fun laugh about the interesting photo shoot someone was doing out on the street/near the front of the building.  I hope to get back again soon.",

The level of care, education, and creative suggestions were so far superior to what we expect - even at very upscale restaurants.  Perhaps it was because we were dining early (5:30 pm to make a show) but we were waited on expertly by Julian and Noza - each partner sharing their expertise in everything from cocktail and wine selection to appetizer, side dish and main course preparations and selections to fit our unique tastes.  They made us feel like we were their most important diners, even as the restaurant became more and more busy.  My wife recommends you try the Pomegranate Martini and the Old Fashioned I enjoyed matched the rich, old-world atmosphere we were enjoying.  Steaks were prepared to perfection and the evening was magical.  Our compliments to the waitstaff, the bartenders and the chef!",

The food was fine, but the experience of dining at a steakhouse in Chicago is all about the experience. I felt as though no one in the restaurant cared about us as customers, besides the bar tender downstairs. We had to wait an entire half hour to even receive menus, and had to ask for them after waiting so long. We also had to ask again for our drinks after another 20 minutes. The menu was never explained to us, while all couples around us received thorough explanation of the various steak options. Our server, Joe, told us steak is \"good\". That was it. Since it was Valentine's Day, all couples around us received a dessert on the house. We were never given that option. The entire night almost felt like a joke. Why were we selected to receive terrible service while everyone around us was waited on hand & foot? I emailed the owner a month ago, and haven't heard back. I called last night to confirm the owner's email address. The manager proceeded to tell me he can only relay information to the owner and hung up on me. I hope this restaurant reevaluates some things because I will never recommend Chicago Chop House to anyone and regret our decision of spending our holiday with them.",

It is barely approachable and affordable wines are limited. I have lived in Chicago for the last 12 years and this was my first time here. I\u2019d recommend other steak locations before the Chicago chophouse though. But if your in that specific area it\u2019s worth a stop in to check it out.",

Now I must say Christopher and The gm made me feel absolutely confortable , and delivered the best customer service . Now let me talk about the food , I\u2019m obsessed with there lobster Mac and cheese that\u2019s all I can think about. Loved how Chris explained the steaks at first I was skeptical about trying dry aged but he didn\u2019t lie the dry aged was the best , steak was seasoned perfect . The lamb chops are most definitely a must try . Over all my experience here was amazing and I will be coming back maybe alone so I can eat my lobster Mac all by myself lol thank you guys for making my birthday amazing .",

Me and my fianc\u00e9 went here lastnight for the first time for dinner. Granted it was busy and we understood that, the host sat us down on the second floor after sitting and waiting for 30 min we noticed to other tables where guest was sitting was serviced immediately who came in after us. It was two married couples sitting next to us that came in after us but was seen before us they offered us they menu because no one still came to our table. My fianc\u00e9 said no I\u2019m going to get a manager, after speaking to a manager he came over to take our orders. The food servers were so rude to us they knocked my purse down 3 times and bumped my chair but never said sorry. Through y\u2019all of this we never got a waiter or waitress at our table. The couple next to us that was from New England seen how a young black couple was being treated and they paid for our meal they exact words were no one from a great city should be treated like this. The manager gave us his card on the way out and told us to book through him next time, how we were treated was wrong, unfair, and disgusting. But the manager Tony Britos was very nice he was the one who made sure we got our drinks and took our order.",

I ate about 4 or five pieces of my steak before we noticed the hair in the corn once I saw the hair of course I was TOTALLY DISGUSTED the thought of eating someone\u2019s hair left me LITERALLY sick to my stomach! I asked for a full refund instead I was given $50 certificate to come back and eat more hair I reached out to the owner and he also refused to give me a refund I feel like we were treated unfairly and I\u2019ts very disappointing and hurtful that something like this could happen in a 5 Star establishment I\u2019ve never made any threats about posting anything online that\u2019s A COMPLETE LIE!!!! I would love for you to post that email because I too have the emails that we shared and never once did I display disrespect or threats all that is displayed is disappointment and hurt from one of your customers and to sit here and try to defame my character is just sad and pathetic!!",

We had a few sides as well, that were well prepared, but honestly, just a distraction from the steak.  I did start with the lobster bisque, and I would highly recommend starting with that. Really quite exceptional.  And finally, the staff was phenomenal. Super friendly and helpful. Which is nice since some servers don't enjoy waiting on children (which I get.) the staff came by and chatted with him, giving us all some laughs and enhancing our experience. We are also non-drinkers, and they suggested some delicious non-alcoholic cocktails that were enjoyed.  Everything about our experience was top notch. I recommend checking it out.",

At first, we were told we had window seating but then they changed it, disappointing.   The tomahawk ribeye, aged and rubbed, was underwhelming.   Not the best I've had, I expected a thicker cut ribeye.  Our server provided excellent advice on wine, we took a bottle home with us.  But we had one other server that I felt was trying too hard to sell us wine, seemed a bit too suggestive.  Would definitely come back and try again.  Great dark wood and ambiance.",

Evidently a couple of other diners had sub-par steak so they contacted their supplier and got rid of a bad batch of steaks. He made good and refunded me for the steaks and invited us back to dine there if we ever returned to Chicago. I mentioned we didn't have plans to go back in the near future but were looking to visit Nashville and he kindly gave me his email for recommendations for places to eat there. I was impressed by his willingness to \"make things right\" and now wouldn't hesitate to try this place again. End Edit I\u2019ve been to all the chain steakhouses like Morton\u2019s, Fleming\u2019s, etc. and wanted a local place for a steakhouse \u201cexperience\u201d. Tried to get reservations two days ahead to a competitor but no time slots available except 5 or 9pm. I should\u2019ve been suspicious when this place had a ton of open time slots.  Place had decent decor, good service and strong wine list. However, you come for the beef! My wife got dry aged filet and I opted for the 10oz. Waygu strip steak having never tried the Waygu before. Well it was very underwhelming. Thin and grizzly and it was no better than $6.99/lb. cuts I get at the local supermarket and grill at home. My wife\u2019s filet was dry and tough by filet standards. Some may ask why didn\u2019t I complain but it was late, we were getting tired and the app, salad and potatoes filled us up so didn\u2019t want to wait for them to cook up another piece.",

Great drinks, I had the King's Bee's Knee's (Bulleit Bourbon, Honey, and fresh lemon) and the Purple Valentine (Grey Goose, Chambord, Fresh lemon and a touch of sugar), my favorite!  We had a great variety of food:  lobster rolls, tuna tartare, steak tartare, duke of bacon, Burrata-wrapped prosciutto, chicken sliders, and prime angus prime rib sliders.  The first/garden floor is dedicated to Chicago gangsters and Chicago mayors.  This is very visible from the outside with the black \"mobster style\" car that is right outside the restaurant on the east side. The 2nd floor is dedicated to the \"Builders of Chicago\" and the 3rd is dedicated to Chicago's history including restaurants, buildings, trains, and musicians.  I missed the tour of all 3 floors and behind the scenes that was given by the new owner, Matthew and hope to check out the 2nd and 3rd floors on my next visit.  They have teamed up with Frank Calabrese Jr. and his ride along tour of Chicago mob sites.  Will definitely come back for either dinner or drinks and appetizers here when I come back for Frank Calabrese Jr's \"Family Secrets organized crime tour\".",

There are many kinds of meat, so it is difficult to choose. Especially, I am worried about whether to choose dry aged. If you've eaten Chicago steaks many times, it's a good experience to choose dry aged. If this is your first time, normal wet aged is safe.  The soup made from the recommended lobster costs over $ 10, but it's really good.

I understand we all human but this is your job. Just rude very rude. Second the food was great only one mistake we asked for no bacon in our broccoli and brussel sprouts but when we recived the items it was bacon all in it.

We are Chicago Natives and now ashamed we have never been here for dinner. I\u2019m unsure what excited my husband and myself more, the service, the food or the ambiance from the history of the building! James was our extremely knowledgeable server whom educated us on the cuts of meat and has thee perfect recommendations. We decided to go with a Dry Aged Ribeye, Lamb Chops with Mint Jelly and Asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. All I can say is...truly phenomenal! We also decided to go with a Moscato & Prosecco which were a perfect pairing for our meal. The dessert we had was just shy of sinful! My husband and myself also met a few other gears that have The Chicago Chop House well oiled, Matthew & Doris. They put the cherry on top! We are Forever Grateful for such a wonderful experience!!!! We will return very soon!",

One of my friends had the lobster bisque soup and she was raving about the flavor.

But let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re there for the steaks and they were superb.  Great bar and wine selection. And desserts are traditional and great... think sundae and cheesecake. Baked Alaska is a must if they are offering it. Ambience is great with tribute to Chicago\u2019s history. Expect to pay top dollar but certainly worth it in my opinion.",
