They have idiot students working there who can't take an order or act professionally.  You cannot bring food inside from anywhere else on the campus itself.  This pertains specifically to a food allergy circumstance where they cannot accommodate for a life threatening food allergy.  The manager claimed BS about \"you would not be able to do this at any other establishment\" as if they are some high class restaurant.  Instead, as paying customers (we ordered multiple drinks and food) they could have accommodated the fact our sole guest member could not eat here.  The manager took no consideration in the fact I was a Georgetown employee and just kept reciting ridiculous rhetoric that \"you can't do this, no one else would let you do this\".  I have been to hole in the wall places that would either let you bring in outside food, or would be able to accommodate you.
