From what I saw, they do have a small patio for dining.  Every person I came in contact with was very friendly from a server who happened to be coming out the door to service a table to another person who gave me the bill.  I ordered the seafood linguini pasta.  The guy over the phone mentioned they could change the pasta to a different one if I liked but I chose to stick with linguini.  The dish was absolutely fantastic!  It was not heavy with cream and other sauces most other restaurants.  There was just something so authentic and plain delicious about the dish.  It made me feel that I was eating a true Italian dish.  Anyway, as you can tell, I would order again.  I also ordered the ricotta cheesecake for dessert.  It's different than what I'm used to (meaning no Graham cracker crust or any crust for that matter) but I still enjoyed.  You can tell it was homemade and could truly taste the ricotta.  I'm eating there again tonight.  Yes, it was that darn good.  They have a 3 course special for $30 so why not?  Highly recommend Sofi!",

The food here is excellent and far closer to what you will get in Italy than most in Chicago. Artichokes and fontina cheese with truffle, outstanding beef carpaccio and a delicious grilled octopus with potato and pesto.  Next we had (party of 6) homemade pumpkin ravioli and gnocchi with porcini mushrooms. Absolutely home made and delicate raviolis surrounded the pumpkin filling with sage, butter and a touch of tomato sauce. The gnocchi were soft pillowy dumplings and they weren't shy with the marvelous porcini.  I had the Veal Osso Bucco with Risotto Milanese. One of the best I've ever had. Absolutely tender and flavorful with perfect risotto. Have enough for my lunch tomorrow!  This really is an excellent restaurant. Wish the wine list had a bit more depth, but the Barbera d'Alba was delicious. They make a SOLID Negroni as well.",

The waiter offered a wine that I had never experienced, he brought out a tasting, it was decent. Before consuming the glass of wine my guest and I inquired about the price point. In general, Sangiovese is not an inexpensive wine however we weren't expecting $27.00 per glass. The waiter responded to our surprise by offering to remove the charge, though we never indicated that's what we were seeking. We received the check and noticed that the charge was not removed so we asked about it and the waiter said, \"Oh my boss said I can not do it\". We were not informed at any moment during the service conversations with our waiter that he was rescinding his offer. We asked for the manager and a man came to our table to totally insult us as if we were attempting to consume without paying. We are embarrassed for this establishment and hope to encourage them to change their attitude. The tip alone would have been more than the cost of the glass of wine and simply not worth ruining our dinner date.",

Wine selection is appropriate for the menu.  Overall, reasonably priced and an excellent value. Other reviewers have complained about the service, but our waiter was both helpful and polite.

Mentioned politely to the waiter that my steak is cold and he snatched the plate from under me and walked away, not saying a word. A few minutes later another waiter came out and slipped the plate back under me with the steak now greyer and dryer! I had 2 bites and left the plate. I am not a fussy eater so leaving food is saying a lot!  To be fair the restaurant atmosphere is quite cosy. We had hoped the food would be decent so we can come regularly as we live close by. Besides the snatching of plates, the serving staff were generally quite friendly, but the overall experience was terrible.",

The burrata is okay, skip the fava beans antipasti all together and the pasta and sauce just don\u2019t quite create any feelings. They have some serious work to do on preparation, combination and plating.  Ambiance: The walls and glass windows really echo people\u2019s conversation and it was extremely loud when we ate, far from a quiet little restaurant feel I was expecting. My guest was embarrassed on my behalf for my pick.  Service: One server covered an entire floor of about 40 people and 7-8 tables and one assist. Our empty dishes sat, at times, for half hour on an otherwise small table before getting picked up. Our server sounded very stressed upon request to understand the pasta selection and we only saw him 4 times in 3 hours. Don\u2019t know what financials look like here but adding another person for evening traffic would be a good idea.  Highly disappointed and will not return here. If you\u2019re a big Italian food fan, heading to West Loop area would be your best dollars spent - Monteverde, Formento\u2019s, Piccolo Sogno, even pizza place Forno Roso (great burrata) is the way to go.",

It came with artichoke hearts that were way too oily, but otherwise good. The bolognese was outstanding. We also ordered dessert. The creme brulee was alright - nothing special, but good.

Our waiter did a bad job though, and probably knew he was going to get a bad tip. So maybe just was just trying to pull a fast one to salvage the situation.

Waiter came by finally, said bread was coming and we had water. He returned and took wine order, no bread. Still no bread this is now fifteen minutes plus, finally wine arrived as did bread. Ahh it was not worth the wait for the bread, insipid would be kind, but needed some sustenance. He returns and we give order, he goes away, comes back and does not remember order, repeat it Salads arrive, and are decent. Wait at least 30 minutes for food and it comes out cold. Oh wait two of them come out cold and one of the four was wrong. One eaten, an entre that had no veggies or starch side, others wait... Two cold ones return and seemed to be recooked and/or had hot water run over them. One was actually good. We mentioned to our waiter that this was unacceptable, he disavowed any responsibility for it. Blaming front of house, and kitchen. He did give us a bottle of wine and not charge us for one we ordered. Also took one of the cold entrees off bill. He was apologetic and asked what could make it right, we replied nothing at this point. Let it be known that other sections had  turned over tables twice, but he said it wasn't his fault. See prior comments. We really wanted this to be a great dinner but it failed so badly that we might grab some Dunkin Donuts or Subway to ease the pain. Very sad, very disappointing, very hungry.",

Upon arriving we were asked if we had reservations because the 4 out of 40 tables were taken so they must of been terribly busy. We got seated outside at our request. Then, waited 20 mins for the waiter to bring water, another 20 mins for a glass of wine and after another 20 mins we finally had the chance to order an app. After 30 mins waiting for the \"polenta\" app (that takes 10mins to cook) we had enough and walked out. So, we sat outside for an hour and a half for a glass of wine and for the waiter to be very inattentive. Oh, but the nice older couple dressed nicely enjoyed  very quick service and received their drinks, appetizer and salad before we had our appetizer. Terrible that they treated us (we were dressed a little more casual than then the average table) like we some punk kids. Never again.",
