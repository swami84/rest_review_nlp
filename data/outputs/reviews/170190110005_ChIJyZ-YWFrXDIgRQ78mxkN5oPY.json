I recently ordered some food from them through DoorDash (the pick 3 meal with catfish, chicken, shrimp, and 2 sides, which were collard greens with turkey and red beans and rice, both to die for) and it took forever for a driver to become available (obviously not Neil St. Blues' fault). I almost cancelled, but then a driver picked up my food at the last minute. I was expecting lukewarm, if not cold food that i would have to microwave. But no, the food was all warm and fresh when it arrived, leading me to conclude that they re-cooked my order after it sat out too long. That kind of customer service is rare and amazing.",

Wasted my time and money. I am also going to point out. I ordered online for pickup so I could have as little contact as possible with people.

We live across town from Neil Street blues about 5 miles and our food was delivered hot. The cat fish was meaty and succulent, crispy on the outside with a mild seasoned breading. Unfortunately I can't say much about the Mac and Cheese because I did not savor it delicately, rather I wolfed it down, taking quite large bites and chewing lethargicly, swallowing mostly whole noodles and figuratively \"throwing back\" the cheese. I was too excited, next time I will order a bigger portion. The Oyster Mushroom Po'boy sandwich was filling, the texture and taste were satisfying, the veggies were fresh. I was happy to find so many vegetarian and even vegan options on their menu. Will try the vegan Jambalaya next time.  Fries are fries, but Neil St Blues' are better. Currently eating the candied yams as a desert, they are sweet and yummy. I plan to refrigerate some and eat them cold later after my numed edible kicks in.  I'll for sure be ordering from here again.

The chili was okay, but too salty, and the sandwich was quite a bit underseasoned. My friend ordered the Blues Burger cooked medium, but it came out more well done, which made it much tougher and harder to eat. Another friend also ordered a fried shrimp po boy which was so salty it was actually inedible. This may have been a one off experience but everything we ordered, with the exception of a salad, was either over or under seasoned.  The service was also mediocre. When we arrived, we were led to a table that had not been cleared yet, so we had to wait a few minutes for it to be cleared. This is not a huge issue, and is normally one I would overlook. After we sat down, the waitress took our drink orders and nearly everyone at the table got water. However, it took an extremely long time for the drinks to come despite being such simple orders, and given that there were not many other patrons in the restaurant. Then after we ordered, the food also took forever to come out. It was at least 20 minutes for even the soups to come. Then after we had started eating the entrees, our waitress did not even stop to check up on us. My friend who ordered the salty shrimp po boy was out of water for around 10 minutes before the waitress finally came and refilled our drinks.  Overall, our group of 6 spent $25 per person and over two hours of our time for mediocre-to-indelible food, underwhelming service, and a generic atmosphere. It left all of us with a bad taste in our mouths and we would not come back here.",

Their portions are generous for the price point and both times I've been here, the food I ordered was delicious. The fried catfish special with spaghetti is delicious and last night I had the gulf shrimp boil which included a pound of jumbo shrimp, potatoes, two pieces of garlic bread, two corn on the cob, and a giant turkey sausage. Our servers have always been very friendly as well.  They have raised the price of their specials a little bit since they opened, but I hope they continue to keep their regular menu prices the same because I plan on coming back to sample the rest of the menu!",

The creole pasta is what I ordered and I was sick all the next day (if you know what I mean). One friend ordered a whiskey and soda and got whiskey and coke. Perhaps a misunderstanding. Ordered again and specified whiskey and soda water. Got whiskey and regular water... Over all food and service were poor. Would not recommend or come back.",

I\u2019ve never had ribs from a restaurant that tasted this good. The waitress told me they marinate them for 6 hours which you can definitely taste. My wife had the 4 chicken wing dinner with Mac and cheese and collard greens. She said the wings were hot , fresh and crispy! Mac and cheese and collard greens was a great portion size and delicious. It also came with a slice of warm bread underneath. We will definitely be back to try out more of the menu.",

The cheese tasted purely processed almost as if it came out of a can. The chicken on the nachos were rubbery and clearly had been frozen. My date ordered the triple threat burger which was also with out a doubt frozen and bland. I ordered the catfish which had the consistency of brand new Goodyear tires. Pure rubber. I had potato salad on the side, I couldn\u2019t take more than the initial bite as it was the most vinager and mustard flavored slop I\u2019ve ever eaten. The fries were good if you like ketchup. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this establishment to anyone unless you participate in trivia night get hammered first then eat. If I was drunk this would be 5 stars.",

I agree with another reviewer that more could be done ambiance-wise that could lend itself to that concept. Playing blues all day doesnt carry that. I appreciate cleanliness, good service, and good food. Tables and place were clean, but utensils had soap residue. Menu is simple and easy to read. Service was good with a smile, but I may have ordered another drink had I had more attention. Food was perfect really. Catfish was hot and breaded well, okra was spot on, and the sweet potato fries had a splash of brown sugar which was a nice touch. Ribs fell off the bone and smoked well. BIG portions! After I asked for the drink menu (?!) I noticed a small, but well rounded selection. I tip according to the overall experience and left 20%. I have every intention of returning with friends. I hope this helps.",

The sweet potato pie tasted freshly made, was slightly warm, had a nice flakey crust, and some whipped cream. Yum!  My husband got four big, full-sized, fried chicken wings, fries, and mac and cheese. He liked his dinner, too, except that the M&C wasn't cheesy enough, in his opinion.",

The catfish, okra, fries, cornbread, and shrimp and grits we're awesome! Their cheese curds are some of the best I've had in town. The collard greens were just okay. There was also live music blues singers that provided excellent entertainment during our meal. The only reason I rate it lower than a 5 was the slow service. All the staff was super friendly, but they definitely have some organizational issues to work out. Our food kept being brought out to the wrong table, we waited a super long time before ordering and for our food to arrive. They're still relatively new so I'm sure they will be more organized in the coming months. I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you haven't yet!",
