My roommate and I frequent this location about once a month (trying to build up those sweet, sweet Pizza Rewards points babey). unfortunately the delivery time is (pardon my language) awful. Every time they give an estimated delivery time, I usually add 30-45 minutes on to it, that's how long it takes to get to me. Really sad. Just a warning for all you pizza lovers out there!!  You must be wondering why we continue to support this Dominos, given their less-than-stellar service. it is solely for the cheese bread. It is our guilty pleasure, I'm sure you guys understand.  - Pleasant Pizza People",

But that wasnt the part that got me. It was the fact the I only saw one person with a mask. The guy that was putting the pizza didnt have on a mask and he was talking over people food. During this of COVID-19 this is really upsetting. This is way I'm scared to eat at restaurants and so many other people. Another reason why businesses are still in the red. The t.v. show commercials taking the proper steps, but when you go in the restaurant its nothing like that.

The worker behind the counter name Mario was extremely polite and beyond understanding with the issue and resolved my problem very quickly. Once again, thanks to Mario, I was able to leave with my order, and become a happy customer even though the dominos pizza app caused this mistake.",

They never cut my pizza in coherent pieces. They are never cut all the way through so I am always surprised with a new jigsaw puzzle when I receive a pizza.  They constantly cancel orders on me, even pick up orders when they are supposed to be open, apparently pick ups here can exceed a 2.5 hour wait. I don\u2019t know who manages this place but obviously they are understaffed with employees that are sloppy.",

I have been getting my pizza made the same for a while once it was messed up I called in because they forgot to put olives. This girl wanted to get an attitude because I wanted my pizza cut in Triangles and squares. The same girl with an attitude made my pizza today this time it was a different pizza close to a week later. She barely put cheese, meet and roasted red peppers on it and didn't cut it in squares and triangles. When my pizza was ready this other girl shook my pizza chastised the boy asking if I paid for it. I am so tired of feeling like all the black girls that work here mess my pizza up purposely. Then when I call in to complain I'm looked at crazy like I'm trying to get free pizzas.

In the middle of me giving my credit card info to the lady taking my order, she tells me to hold on a second. I held on for over 7 minutes to then just be disconnected. I then try to call back 8 times over the course of the next 10 mins to only get a busy signal. On the 10th try calling back I get the same lady and she asks me to hold and I tell her no and explain why. What does she do, put me hold! Something that should take no longer than 2 or 3 minutes turned into a 15 minute ordeal. They have horrible customer service and I will not be ordering from this location again.",

Before I could do anything, my front door bell rings. The delivery man, Orlando, was here. I couldn't believe it. He was really nice and upbeat. He laughed when he saw how flabbergasted I was by the speedy delivery.  How fast did the whole ordering process + delivery take? 20 minutes.  Granted, I live near Hollywood and Broadway, about half a mile from the establishment, but that was seriously the FASTEST delivery I've EVER experienced in my life.  5 STARS.",

The product took up almost 1/5th of the container at best. Is this what passes as  \"good enough\" for Domino's standards?",
