At first I was a little skeptical when I saw the tacos were $4 each. Pretty high for my standards to be honest, but then the order came in and I was super excited. What stood out was the warm greeting by the staff. The efficient kitchen workers, and the best part was the food. We try a sampler for tacos. Carne Asada, Chorizo, Pollo and Carnitas. The chicken and carnitas were my favorite due to how juicy they were. The flavor profile was great, not too much salt, the sauces were fresh and the tortilla is what always makes it breaks the deal for me! Super glad to have tried them and they have gained a new customer!",

So this weekend we decided to take a 40 min trip down the memory lane to see how the new location is doing.  The menu was instantly recognizable as well as the no frills but homely interior. On the negative side, even in the new location the restaurant is still manages to be annoyingly drafty with a gust of icy wind whenever somebody enters or exits the place.  Also, sadly the taste did not live up to our memory of the place. The meats in tacos were just a little bit too dry and the sauces were not as rich in flavor and depth as we remembered.  It was still great food and good value for money just not as amazing as we had remembered it. If you are in the area definitely give it a try, and we would come back if it was anywhere closer to Queens but as it stands we don't think it's worth  the long trip to Bushwick.",

The food is similar to what many might see from a taqueria with a more fresh and bright taste I found.  The star for me are the amazing breakfast burritas (slightly smaller than a normal burrito but packs flavor, consider ordering two) which you can get with normal egg bacon fare but I would highly recommend the chroizo and potato that blends perfectly with the bean spread.  For lunch the mole Enchiladas are filled with perfectly cooked fresh cheeses and doused in a flavorful, spiced, and familiar cocoa taste you expect with a great mole.  On top of all of this the prices are very reasonable portions are more than generous (one could argue the tacos are TOO stuffed with meat), and the staff is very polite.  For a small bite or a full meal this is a great spot to meet friends and have a fantastic meal in the neighborhood.",

The steak tacos, 3 to an order, were also good; as were the cecina enchilada tacos. The only nit to pick was that the cecina enchilada in this restaurant is not the salty, cured cecina normally served at other Mexican restaurants. The server explained that their cecina enchilada is pork similar to tacos al pastor. The regular cured cecina is not always available on their menu. Also, don't forget to visit their red light district/bathroom \ud83d\ude05 while you're in there. Overall, you could do worse than Gordo's.

Plus we started with the chips & salsas so I had some habanero salsa to put on my tacos since I like things extra spicy. But I got to say the salsa verde was our favorite one taste-wise. The staff also accidentally forgot to put in our order, which we didn't really mind, but they were so nice about it, they sent some complimentary churros over. They were also the best churros I've ever had. If I had to say anything negative about this place it would be that it's tiny (so it's potentially difficult to get a seat) but that's actually part of its charm as a cantina, so 5 stars!",

This all changed when a few friend and I went in for dinner after climbing and I must say it is by far some of the best hispanic food ive had in that area and perhaps in ny. The second part may be arguable. But still the food is reasonably priced for its taste. Very flavorful. And chill vibes. I would recommend to my friends.",

The open faced quesadillas looked more like cheese crisped tacos; the meat was very tender, juicy and marinated in a flavorful sauce. The dipping sauce that came with every dish was so refreshing and wonderful. I enjoyed the crunch and freshness in the carrots, radish and cilantro toppings. Another highlight of our meal was the super chunky guacamole and seemingly homemade chips.",

They have Pacifico and Modelo on draft, priced at $7 and $3 (small glass).  We ordered some Taco's and Burritos. While they were not packed with too much flavor, they were still really good.  Service was excellent and they have a friendly staff. The ladies in our group were totally checking out the server. I think his name was Doug.  Highly recommend checking out this place if you are into Mexican food.",

The tacos here are not better than average, and certainly not as good as El Toro Rojo when the truck is parked by Court Square. The pollo taco is dry and not flavorful, the cochinita taco is also a little dry (they try to dress it up with pickled onions but still), the asada was one of the least remarkable asada tacos I have had in recent memory...the only truly great taco I had was the carnitas, which was flavorful and juicy as all get-out. They also tried to overcharge us for our beers, which were listed as $5 on the menu but $7 in their system. They should fix that.  Meh. This place benefits from a lack of any decent competition in the area. It could be so much better, but people in this neighborhood don't care because they're desperate for their \"authentic\" (overpriced yuppie-friendly) Mexican food. If this was competing with the taco spots in the Lower East Side or on the 7 train a few more stops out, it would have closed months ago.",

He was very polite, very professional and took pride in his job. Can't say enough about how great he was. Took the time to explain everything on the menu. I am a taco guy so I had chorizo tacos and chips and guac. Everything is made fresh to order in an open kitchen. The tacos were amazing, little salty, but amazing. I mean the best chorizo tacos I have ever had. For me, the chips are important. My family loves to start with chips and guac but some places the guac is not great and others, the chips not great. This place nailed it. Unfortunately, you get a small portion of guac for a large pile of chips but hey, lets face it, avocados are super expensive right now. I was so excited about the tacos that I went back the same day for dinner! I get really annoyed by taco places that won't let you mix the tacos. This place has a 4 taco sampler. Steak, chicken, chorizo and pork. The chorizo, as I said, was amazing, pork amazing, the steak was a little gristly, the chicken I could do without. I will give the steak another try as I see in the reviews that people like the steak. Long story short. I went twice in one day and I will be back 1,000 times. The word on the streets is that their sandwiches (tortas) are also excellent. One thing to consider is that they are smack dab next door to Scandals, a fairly large strip club. It is not unsafe. It is a very busy area next to the entrance to the Queensboro Bridge. Please don't let that dissuade you though but keep in mind that the music can be heard through the walls.",
