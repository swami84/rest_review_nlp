I'd say their brisket is top-notch, but my hubby likes their spicy bacon the most.

Changes I've noticed are all welcomed and keep with the spirit of JDs.  The mac and cheese is different but just as good in a smaller side size portion and smaller price. It's my favorite kind of mac and cheese with a perfect balance of cream and saltiness.  The pickled chayote is something that any foodie would appreciate. It's got a sweet, sour, salty balance I love in Filipino cuisine.  The brisket is the same: tender deliciousness. On the brisket sandwich, there's carmelized onions which IMO replace the need of a sauce.  There is Korean style fried chicken now as well. The soy garlic is heavier on the garlic.  I look forward to patronizing Oiso, in the best meaning of the term.  Bravo.",

I\u2019ve only tried the ribs and I\u2019d give it the thumbs up if you like the falling off the bone long flavorful smoked ribs.  The bar was well stocked and tap just needed a few more options (3\u2019s not enough for some). All and all I excited to try the rest of the menu.",

        "caption": "The atmosphere is awesome. The decor is very authentic. I know it's a soft opening. However, you do want to get the basics rights. The brisket is dry. They may want to choose a brisket with a bit more fat content.  They did a few things right. Their pulled pork and ribs were delicious with perfect smoke rings. And those pickles. Awesome.  The bar is stocked and provide options. But in reality you just want cold bottle beers. Fancy drinks really dont mix.  As a Texas native I understand the intentions. But they sorta missed the mark. Will revisit to see if things get better.",
