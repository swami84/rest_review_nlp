        "caption": "** Their COVID protocols include a temperature scanner near the entrance.  They mounted the thermometer on the wall at a certain height so shorter people might need to tippy toe for the forehead reading. Every employee is wearing masks and tables are placed to promote social distance inside.  There is a structure outside with seating for anyone who likes a cool a breeze with their food. Customers are required to fill out a contact sheet per health guidelines.  The menu is accessed via a QR code to limit physical contact.  My guest and I got a table in the corner which was nice.  Our main server was a very nice lady named Suchasinee (Sucha for short).  She checked on us often and made some good entree recommendations. Another employee named Jade came by to make sure we were good even though he may have been busy in the kitchen.  The drink menu was separate and consisted of signature cocktails and some beer options.  Each cocktail had a special combination that made it unique.  It is not very often that I would participate but some of the drinks sounded very good.  Sucha made some recommendations and we decided on Jungle Juice (Mehkong Compari, Cherry Heering, Grapefruit, Passionfruit and Hibiscus Lime) for myself and my guest ordered After A Long Day (Angels Envy, Chrysanthemum, Yellow Chartreuse, St Germain and Dolin) because the name stood out.  The Jungle Juice was very tasty and refreshing.  The After A Long Day is very strong and is a great drink for HH or winding down literally after a long day.  Compliments to the employee Pat who was at the bar as she made all the drinks for us.  And of course we had to have classic Thai Ice tea on the side.  Something newer about the menu was the addition of \"KUB KLAEM\" which they translate on the menu as \"small plates\" and are perfect for sharing and pairing with drinks.  The ones we tried were Goi Neu (Chef's signature dish consisting of Isan style spicy beef tartare, with shallots, toasted rice, cilantro and complemented by taro chips and seasonal vegetables).  A FAIR WARNING...this dish is VERY SPICY.  Even my guest who loves spcicy food had to take a step back after sampling the beef tartare.  I am not a big spice fan and thought she was exaggerating (which she was not).  This dish has a kick that will have flames of savory goodness dancing on your tongue while burning your taste buds.  I highly recommend it!!  The second dish we tried was the Koor Moo Yang (succulent grilled pork jowl with spicy jaew tamarind dipping sauce.  The pork was tender and savory yet I had no issue with the sauce (probably because my taste buds were damaged from the beef tartare. kidding) and we both were fighting for the last piece.  I lost that fight btw.  The third \"small plate\" we tried was called Pla Muk Yang (grilled octopus with cilantro and chili lime sauce). This is considered a favorite after school snack according to the menu.  These snacks are definitely fancier than what I am used to eating!  The octopus was tender and tasty.  For classic appetizers, we ordered the Chicken Satay with a side of peanut dipping sauce.  You cannot go wrong with that.  We wanted to try some entrees and I went with my go to Pad See Ew with Shrimp, Chicken and Beef (I paid extra for the latter as the dish usually only comes with one protein).  My guest has fancy taste and when our server Sucha mentioned Khao Pad Poo (crab meat fried rice with onions, scallion egg) it was ordered on the spot. It was nice to have a rice dish among everything else and this was a very good choice to share.  Sucha recommended one more dish was was a specialty called Pad Cha Talay (stir fry shrimp, squip, scallop mixed with birds eye chili, garlic, green peppercorn, lime leaf, basil and fingeroot) and this certainly lives up to its description. It sounds daunting but the flavors all complement each other.  Check this place out!!",

Also has the crab and pork wrapped in tofu skins. Also very bland and nothing special. Little flavor except a fishy smell from the crab. I missed typical Thai flavors, acid and heat. Maybe I ordered wrong but I won\u2019t be ordering from here again: I\u2019m sticking with Klom Klom on Wyckoff. Really sad I thought this sucked.",

Great for friends, family, and small(er) gatherings, it's worth coming out to the area, even if you don't live in bed-stuy. Many dishes are meant to be shared so it's a fun experience. COVID: All employees were wearing PPE, (they even have a clear view into the kitchen to watch the chefs, who were all wearing PPE). They also had a lot of outdoor seating set up in like a semi permanent patio space, which was great and cozy, strung up with lights.  Pros: -Food. Really some of the best Thai food I've ever had, attested to by Thai locals who I've visited Tong with. Some of my favorites were Khao Soi (curry with noodles and chicken) and Som Tum Thai (papaya salad), in addition to any of the Kub Klaem (small plates), including the Goi Neu (tartare), Oysters (seriously good and fresh, dressed up Thai style), and Tod Hua Phee (savory and crisypy banana blossom pancake). -Atmosphere. A really inviting and modern space, even the plates and cutlery are really nice looking. Definitely a nice date spot. -Service. Incredibly nice people, I think many of the owners work the front of the house and their level of service and attention to detail really shows.  Cons: -None, really! I think they only con could be if you're looking to host like 10+ people (but who is during Covid?), the space could be tight. Still, once large gatherings are allowed I'm sure they would try to accommodate with a reservation or something.",

Green papaya salad with crunchy catfish and peanuts. Shrimp noodles with bean sprouts, chives, pickled radish.  You can get takeout or dine outside.

Love the presentation as well as the taste:) yummmm!!  Catfish salad, salmon salad and grilled pork with spicy tamarind dipping sauce are so delicious!!!  Love the vibes and the service as well.

Thai tapas is a new concept to me but the staff was great at giving recommendations and teaching us about Thai culture/cuisine.  The octopus was incredible. I can't believe how soft and tender it was. I also recommend the seafood curry in young coconut.  Lastly I have to say that I'm equally impressed with their Thai staple food. We wanted to get a basic dish and ordered the drunken noodle. It was honestly the best ever had in my life. You wouldn't think these dishes couldn't be \"improved\" but tong hit it out of the park!",
