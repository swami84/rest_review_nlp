I get there and I see 6 DoorDashers and 3 GrubHubers waiting in addition to 1 customer who had ordered over the phone. About 10 minutes later 2 additional customers who had called in came in because they were told it would be a 10 minute wait so they were lied to. Cheng's Garden had lost two of the ticker orders of the non-delivery people that were waiting and they were NOT happy. Personally, I wasn't happy because as a DoorDasher we make a low commission and we are lucky if the customer even tips $2.00. So it wasn't worth it for that long wait time and low tip. I asked the cashier where my customer's order was but she blew me off. I personally will not order from here ever and I will start rejecting DoorDash orders from here.",

So we decided to try this place. What a waste of time and money. The food was inedible. I ordered orange chicken and my husband ordered sesame chicken. Both were in the exact same horrible tasting sauce. The only difference was his chicken had sesame seeds, uncooked, sprinkled on it. While we were pushing our food around on our styrofoam plates with our plastic forks looking for one mosel of redeemable food, i kept smelling cigarettes but couldnt figure out from where.  When I went to throw our food away, i found the source of the stench. The trashcan reeked of cigarette butts. As we pulled away, vowing to ourselves never to return,  the counter lady came outside to smoke, glaring at us the whole time. Lol. She must have plenty of time to smoke since there weren't any other customers or calls while we were there. Now we know why!!",

Crab rangoons had a dish soap taste to it. It definitely tastes like they don't care at all and other customer's experiences are just egregious. No way, never again... I wish I had read reviews before buying this over priced nastiness.  My experience was a 2 star at best, but after reading how they've treated others they've lost a star as well. Bottom line: don't eat here. There are better Asian restaurants around town. Much, much better.",

They delivery was fast and the food was hot!! Well we took our food out of the box and all of it but one meal was wrong so I called and spoke to the female working ( who is rude to start out with) she told me she\u2019ll replace the food and for us to bring in the wrong food. Then she called back and said we didn\u2019t have to bring the other food in and she\u2019ll still make it right. So now I\u2019m stuck with 3 meals that none of us will eat because it\u2019s not something we like. So my husband went and got the food cake home and our \u201c meals \u201c went from rice and the  entr\u00e9e  To just a little hamburger  styrofoam   Container  Like what you would get at BBops with your burger. So I called again and said this is not what I paid for $50.98 she said I already replaced it. I said you didn\u2019t replace the meal. So she was not going to do anything about it. I told her I won\u2019t be ordering from you again and she said that\u2019s fine. She also tried to tell me what I ordered was not what I had said. I said \u201c you can go through my order history and see that I always get the same things the exact same way each and every time.  Now I start eating my shrimp lo main and the noodles taste horrible they don\u2019t taste fresh at all, my husband had gotten the  cashew chicken along with my daughter who got the cashew chicken  There was barley any chicken!!! So not only we were out $50.98 but we are also hungry so my husband spent more money going to KFC to get dinner. I refuse to go back here. Unless I get an  apology  From someone.",

Used their online ordering system to place a pick up order. My husband went to pick it up and paid, then had to wait. On his way out the door he was stopped and was told that he would have to pay... again. The lady told him that the first time he ran the card was not actually the payment. It was just acknowledging the order and that he wasn't actually charged. Confused, but assuming she knows what she's talking about, he swiped his card again. But lo and behold, she lied! There are now TWO charges on my bank statement. The online ordering company says one will be reversed and were totally rude as well. But even if one of the charges is reversed, our funds are unavailable for use for three or four days. $100 for $50 order that was probably only worth $30 really sucks. Some of the food was alright. The orange chicken was good as were the egg rolls. The lo mein was super greasy and flavorless.  Either they are too stupid to run their OWN online ordering system or they are scam artists. Either way, avoid this place. It's not worth the hassle at all. We order take out maybe once a year. Thanks for ruining the experience and causing our paycheck to paycheck family so much undue burden. We plan for these types of expenditures. How do I put food in the fridge and gas in the car while you toy with us over the $50 you stole?? Bad business.",

We were 4 adults and 2 kids and she charged us more that what it was and we didn't even get the rice that come with it nor the soup. We still paid extra and some of us including my little ones got sick with stomach ache that lasted for 2 days. Because not to get her mad because you dont know if they put something else or get charged more that what is supposed to. Also there is a box of popsicle candy and it is written .50cents each or 3 for $1.00 dollar. But she charged me $1.00 dollar each popsicle and when back to get the rest of the money and she got mad and didnt want to give me back the rest until i showed her the box that says 3 for $1.00.  I told her not to get mad and later she went to the table and told us \" the next time you come back make sure you know what you going to order so you dont make me waste time telling the cooks what you want\". It was frustating and annoying because it was the very first time we went there, and you have to order before you even go to the table. So come in, stand and order, then go to any table you want to seat to wait for your food.",
