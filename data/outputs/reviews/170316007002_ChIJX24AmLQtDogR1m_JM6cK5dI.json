It also came with an array of vegetables (which I love) of onion, green onion, carrots, baby corns, eggplant, sweet and hot peppers, basil leaves and bean sprouts. They also prepared enough that lasted me for three days. As a treat, I ordered a slice of the green tea cheesecake as well. It was delicious! They are extremely fast in there and I do know that they deliver and also use Postmates delivery. Check the website for the times, as I am not sure. I walked past there around 5:30 pm on a Friday.",

Forever to order, to receive our food and then to get the check.  There\u2019s like 5 tables here what gives??  After we received the check I noticed they applied a gratuity of $8. Excuse me?? It was LUNCH for TWO PEOPLE. I told the hostess I am happy to tip, and always do but to add it to the check for two people is surely a mistake. She confirmed the charge was valid and standard. Ha. Okay.  Hope it was worth it to lose faithful customers over $8 that you would\u2019ve gotten anyways.",
