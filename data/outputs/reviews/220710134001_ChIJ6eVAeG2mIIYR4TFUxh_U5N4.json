Had 2 appetizers, the potstickers were very good, the cheese curds were good minus the over cooked ones that had exploded w no cheese inside, which was about half of them. Then ordered the salmon, tasted pretty good but it was overcooked, the rice was dry and the green beans w it were also overcooked almost mushy. Pretty sure the salmon was frozen and nit fresh. We had 2 orders of salmon at the table, both the same. Son had the cheeseburger w fries and a salad, that was good. Mom had the mac n cheese w lobster n shrimp. The lobster was like non existant and not enough cheese in it, so it wasn't creamy. More like eating semi-dry pasta. The waiter we had was very nice but very spacey and not very customer service oriented. His name was Zak. Told Zak the food was okay, he just said okay good back, and left.. lol. Had to ask him twice for lemons for my water. I ordered an amaretto sour. Probably the worst one I've had ever, hands down, and I'm 40. It tasted like they mixed water w it. I asked for a shot of amaretto to add to it bc it was so weak. Zak told me ya, we've heard that before, its because its only a 2 oz mix drink sorry...umm ok lol. Anyways the additional shot didn't make it taste any better, it tasted super flat like they hadn't changed the soda they added to it. So I told Zak that and he said he'd check w the bar tender. He came back and asked us like 10 mins later how everything was and if we needed anything, again, made no mention of my drink and brought us the check. So I asked, did the bartender say anything about this drink n why it tastes so bad? He said, ya, but that other lady left already that made your drink and the bartender now said she probably did her own thing instead of making it correctly. I said ok? And he just said sorry. Never offered to correct the drink and charged me 12 for it. Also had to ask this dude twice for cherries. Just a sad overall experience for a $150 meal and in my opinion not worth the price. If I wrote a short review it would say \"overcooked food w poor customer service\". Honestly, just go somewhere else.",

This restaurant was next door (separated by a walkway) We ordered from our room for pickup. We were told 15 minutes. I decided to get there early so that our food would not be waiting and getting cold, I arrived within 5 minutes (it was 2 minutes from our room. I paid and tipped the hostess. 10 minutes later she arrived from the kitchen with our carry out bag and a drink. I asked \u201cwhat is this?\u201d Referring to the drink. She replied \u201cit\u2019s a Sprite\u201d. I said I didn\u2019t order a drink. She replied \u201cI know\u201d. I asked because both hands were full are their utensils for 2 in the bag, she assured me there was. I returned to our room where we prepared to eat (we were starving after walking Nola). My wife asked about the drink and we had a chuckle about it. There was only one set of utensils. We had ordered an appetizer, steak, and wagyu beef burger. They forgot to put the appetizer in the bag, my steak that I had ordered medium rare was medium (I hate over cooked steak), my wife\u2019s burger ordered medium was rare (she hates a rare burger). She took one bite and the blood ran into the bun, her appetite was ruined from that point on (she ate nothing else). My steak was served as a single over cooked piece of meat in a plastic dish about 4 times the size of the steak. The steak was cold. I was hungry and so ate the steak by picking it up (it was too tough to cut), I ate it by dipping it into catchup (the only way I can eat an over cooked steak). I then called the restaurant to complain about the entire disappointment. The manager said our appetizer was there waiting for us. I refused to accept an appetizer that had been setting and outlined with him as I\u2019ve done here the list of grievances with the entire experience. His only offer was to remake the entire meal for us and then to say that he was sure we would not be interested in that, at which point I agreed. The place looked very inviting, I was very excited to try it as I love craft beer. What a complete and total disappointment. It should have been a complete refund and a \u201clet us make it up to you\u201d. As it is I will never return and will tell others of our experience.",

I have ordered take out from your restaurant at least three times a month.  So, to say my recent experience with your company was disappointing, is an understatement.  On November 21, 2020 I placed an order from Gordon Biersch through the Postmates App for my husband\u2019s birthday.  I proceeded to wait about 1.5 hours when I received a phone call from my Postmates Driver.  She was currently still waiting at Gordon Biersch for my food, and she asked me if I had received my food already. I responded, confused, with a no, and that I was about to reach out to them on why my order was taking so long.  I could hear her tell the people at GB what I said and she tells me well they gave your food to someone else, so they are going to put a rush order in to remake my food and get it out to me.  At this time I understood that mistakes happened, I thanked them and we hung up.  About five minutes later my driver calls me back and informs me that GB changed their mind and they weren\u2019t going to remake anything because they would lose out on the sale. They said if I wanted my money I could follow up with Postmates.  Now, this is the frustrating and disappointing part of this experience.  GB gave my food to the wrong person. That wasn\u2019t the fault of Postmates, my driver, or me. However, instead of fixing their mistake and incompetence to ensure the food went to the right people, I was nonchalantly informed that they would not be fixing this issue. So, here I am at 9 pm, no food, a hungry husband and seven year old, because of a mistake GB made, no one else.  I have loved this company for my entire adult life. However, after this experience, I am reluctant, if not entirely turned off to ever ordering or dining at GB again.  Any decent manager would have seen to having this issue fixed, especially since it was their mistake, no one else\u2019s.  I do not normally reach out to corporations like this, but this was especially angering when I was told they were going to fix the issue, but then countered their previous statement, because they were going to be out the $50 I spent.  It\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about the principle, and if these are the values and responses of GB, well then my business with GB is over.  I\u2019m disappointed that any business would handle an issue, such as this, with zero professionalism and commitment to their patrons. Without patrons your business would not exist.  Very Respectfully, Samantha Abbruzzi",

The kitchen not so much; the CBLT sandwich is chicken and bacon, but the chicken came out so dry we left most of it on the plate. Fortunately, the garlic Parmesan fries are really well done and got scarfed down like there was a contest going on.  We had the chicken wing appetizer and it was ok. I think I'd try something different next time, though. My social coordinator seemed to enjoy them, but she was taking so much I wasn't sure she even tasted them. :)  She also really enjoyed her Hummus and Goat Cheese salad, too. (Ok, SEEMED to)  The company was the best part of the meal; well, our company and Janice; she was the bomb.  The place serves a lot of beer and, while we didn't partake, it seems to be the biggest draw. Probably would have made the sandwich edible, too, ha!",

When the cheeseburger came it was extra juicy and too salty. The apple bread pudding was also DRY and I could not finish it. The ice cream with pecans however was delicious. For a fountain coke they charge 3 dollars and change....unbelievable!  I advise to go somewhere else....cleanliness might be an issue here. If you order a burger scan the buns for hair baked in.

The bar food and the grilled foods are great but the $25 spent on the lobster pasta was a waste of my money.",

If a resturant doesn\u2019t want to offer a sampler cup of a beer they\u2019ve brew because of \u201ccost\u201d then something is wrong.  My friend ordered the Cajun pasta for $20+ and the portion was not up to \u201cLouisiana\u201d standards. It was small and pricy and not worth the cost.  I ordered bruschetta chicken. My food came out wrong the first time and needed to Be remade. The remake was speedy but the pasta with the basalmic vingarette was too much. I do not recommend as a dish.",
