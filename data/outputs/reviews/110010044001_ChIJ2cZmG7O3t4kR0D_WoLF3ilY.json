While the taste was okay (the brisket was good, though) there was barely meat on the tacos. Especially on the chicken taco, it was basically all pico de Gallo and the tiniest portion of chicken. We also ordered the steak burrito. It was terrible. There wasn\u2019t much meat and it tasted worse than Taco Bell. The guacamole was good, but the the chips weren\u2019t even great. I hate to give a bad rating to a new restaurant, especially during covid, but the food just wasn\u2019t great. Pro: fast takeout and cleanliness helped the rating.",
