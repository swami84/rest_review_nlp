Was kind of put off when I walked in I heard the server say he would have brought the food to her the other customers table. When my food came he shouts my number, I wait he shouts, I wait he shouts my number again so I go pickup the order from the counter, I guess he would only deliver the other customers food  Again 1 of 2 tables mind you. The queso was tasteless. I had a steak, pastor and ground beef taco. The meat was extremely low quality and I could not tell the difference between the pastor and ground beef, lol. The steak was way overcooked, dryest steak I ever had. My wife had the taco salad with chicken and that wasn't bad, just not a whole lot of flavor. The best thing about the place was the salsa, that was very good.  Take a look at all the 4-5 star reviews of this place, look at how many other reviews those people have written. Now look at all the bad reviews, look to see how many other reviews those people have left. Don't be fooled, this place won't last a year. The high stars are the friends and family reviewers",

The only redeeming quality was that they gave you a large quantity of food for a below average price. I guess you get what you pay for.",

People with allergies, Non-dog lovers, or just general people wanting to eat without dogs over your food,may want to be cautious. Where is this dog being kept in the restaurant? Why over my food?
