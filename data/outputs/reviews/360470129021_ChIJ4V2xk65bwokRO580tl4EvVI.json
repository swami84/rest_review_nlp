There was bbq sauce on both but they didnt smoother the meat in it which is good to me because i dont like most sauce but theirs was good. As my 2 sides i had the cesar salad and mac n cheese both was very good. My mother had the beef brisket sandwich and mac n cheese what she didnt like was on the sandwich you get the chopped beef brisket instead of slices which she didnt know you had to ask for the sliced brisket for the sandwich, the choppes brisket was kinda tough for her teeth but she still enjoyed it.. They gave us samples also my mother tried the pulled pork and they gave use cornbread on top of the roll that came with my meal we liked it all. The prices arent over the top for where they are located I will be going back.",

Then we were told to order at the beginning of the line  which was at the far end across the entrance area.  The gentleman who assisted us is the pit-master, Mr. Louise. He was friendly and gladly offered us advise when I asked what was good to try as it was our first time at that location .  Although,   my family have had Dickey' s a few times when  we visited Dallas. We had the 2 for $24 deal which includes 2 platters of 2 meats,  2 sides and a bread. It was a GREAT offer.  We all loved the sliced brisket and pulled pork. The smoked Turkey and ribs were tender and juicy too. We loved the collard greens,  barbecue beans and fried  okra.  The coleslaw was good but a tad sweet to our liking.  Least favorite side was Mac and cheese. All in all we will definitely be back as it was a very reasonably priced BBQ restaurant with their promotion.  Tips: Request for the spicy barbecue sauce by the counter.  It goes well with the meats.",

From the moment you walk in its transports you to southern hospitality, my rootz so I know. The smell is so powerful the smoke alarm can't even recognize good taste in the air.  Its amazing thats just the feeling you get when you walk in. But, when you walk in you are immediately introduced to a staff that is beyond awesome. Friendly, personable and eager to please. You don't find that much up here but trust me, you will at Dickeys.  The food will knock your socks off. Its like a you're at Food Network Bbq square off, yes I just went there. You try samples that fit you. Hey, they do good stuff, cooking, here and I'm happy to be able to do this review. The ribs, pulled pork, brisket and then you have sides. Simply put the Mac and Cheese. Just grandma would make every Sunday. But, so much better, don't tell grandma.  If you're visiting and want a sense of home or live here and want a sense of authentic, in my opinion, southern food then Dickeys is my first recommendation and more than likely the only.  Enjoy guys!  Mattie J!",
