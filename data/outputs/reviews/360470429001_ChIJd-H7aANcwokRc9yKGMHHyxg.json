        "caption": "The food is very ok, nothing stands out as exceptional but its not bad either, I'd give it a 3/5 for the food alone. The real winner here is the charm of the place amidst a sea of bland options or hipster dives that populate Bushwick. Its lovely, with solid music choices that fit the atmosphere and the ambiance makes up for what is an otherwise superlative-lacking experience.  Service feels French in that there is a lack of attention to diners, which can be a positive if you want to post up with a book, or a negative if you have alot of demands for brunch. Servers are friendly but put no effort to refill coffee or drinks, take away finished plates, or check-in in a timely manner. It didn't affect my experience much but bad service at least feels on brand in a French bistro.  Hopefully more places like this will open in the area, the vibe and pleasantness of being there outweighs some of the lackluster aspects.",

Never again. Learn to handle a service issue with some sort of competence. I didn\u2019t need them to bend over backwards, everyone makes mistakes. A simple sorry and how can we make it better would have sufficed. To be accused of possibly taking advantage of them is ridiculous. Worst of all they said to handle it with door dash.

Very cute and small with dim mood lighting. Good for dates or small groups, bad for children/larger groups. The menu is also what you'd expect from a decent French bistro, with a few interesting additions. I had the skate fish, which I hardly ever see despite how easy they are to catch locally. It was delicious. The escargot was decent and the french onion soup was great.",

The server told me I shouldn't have my dinner at 5 because that's when they open. I have been a line cook for 7 years in NYC and im Fully aware that the kitchen should be prepared upon service starting even if there is a party of 12.After mentioning I wanted a pre fixe menu he then told me I had to email tyler the manager who never got back to me. I called again and a new sever said she'd give tyler my contact info and he has yet to call me. I made a reservation somewhere else. That was an EASY 1500 dollar you could have made in one night but clearly mominette is too good for my money",

The reward was a pretty lush plate of Eggs Benedict wit buttery, roasted red potatoes and a side of mesclun greens with what sermed to be a dinon mustard vinaigrette. Perfect balnce of flavors really!! Instead of ham, I opted for the bacon and was pleasantly satisfied with the crispy, thick pieces. I see what all the fuss is about ! For $13 this is epic! Mominette Bistro is a great place to tantalize your taste buds and it looks like the cocktails at $9-10 might be the perfect addition on a lazy Saturday or Sunday or whenever! Oh I am returning but I may need to eat more items on that menu..Highly recommend you do the same!",

I don\u2019t want to waste food but also not paying for the staff\u2019s lunch. Came at the end of brunch service and food was not good. It didn\u2019t help the situation.

This place used to have really nice burgers a frys as well as tartar and other great dishes and great brunch. So much we came here for New Years eve and other holidays and also took out of town guests here. That was when the menu was on paper.. now its in a dinner style plastic sleeve with cheesy clip art. And the food tastes just as good as the menu. Don't get me wrong.. the food is edible but I wouldnt label it as a French Bistro anymore.

        "caption": "Came here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, service was great with being seated right away and orders taken. Food selection for brunch was cute. Ordered eggs Benny, eggs parm, and Mac and cheese. Food presentation was nice, however the food lacked seasoning. The eggs Benny my eggs were over poached almost hard boiled egg like and the sauce needed a bit more seasoning to hold it together. The eggs parm was very fresh however it was bland in the seasoning. The Mac and cheese was very cheesy but again very bland, they needed to place seasoning in the sauce it just tasted like pasta and cheese thrown together. Overall nice atmosphere for a quick brunch.",

Main course came before soup and salads. My order was never taken. When I finally placed the order, my food came before my friend who had placed his order well over an hour ago. As we rushed to finish our food, the server was not to be found to pay the bill. When the bill came in, it was all messed up with the food orders that we ordered but never got.  It was just a disaster!  The beef tartare was all brown and looked like cooked tuna with quite a bit of fat in it. Beef tartare is not recommended.  The only thing I enjoyed was the drinks and the delicious beef bourguingnon!",

I got they're spinach and goat cheese croissant, which hit the spot as a not-too-heavy starter for the day.
