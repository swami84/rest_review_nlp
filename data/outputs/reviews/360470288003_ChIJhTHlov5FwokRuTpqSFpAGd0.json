I liked how the menus had lots of pictures of the dishes.  We ordered the crab soup dumplings which is a must have item. It was absolutely delicious and paired very well with their sweet vinegar. Just as good if not better than Joe Shanghai's but in a much more convenient location in Brooklyn.  The pork belly was really tender and flavorful. Perfect to eat with a bowl of white rice. The sweet spare ribs packed a lot of flavor as well.  Overall the price was right and the food was great. We'll definitely be coming back here many more times as we saw a couple of dishes other folks ordered that looked really good.  UPDATE 2:  So good we had to come back for the soup dumplings and try the other items.  It definitely did not disappoint at all!  Grandma's Pork was braised so perfectly tender and oodles of flavor!  The spicy chicken was on point!  The right amount of savory, spicy and the perfect amount of crispness.  The scallion noodles was another star dish.  So simple yet done amazingly!  The spare ribs was a bit dry the first time but they redeemed themselves the 2nd time and it was much more juicy this time around.  I actually dipped some of the spicy chicken in the spare rib sauce :)  The chicken in spicy oil is sooo good. Literally every piece was the perfect dark meat and no bones!  Got some soup dumplings for take away it tastes just as great. Remember to get the delicious sweet vinegar to go!  UPDATE3:  The general tsos tasted really good but the texture wasn't crispy enough. I prefer the breading to be very crispy.  The golden shrimp had a nice salted egg flavor but I would prefer it within the shell unless it was made crispier.  The scallion pancake is cooked perfectly. Light and delicious!  UPDATE4:  Wuxi ribs - braised to the point where the meat falls off the bone. Tastes similar to grandma's pork without all the fat.  I really like a edible cartilage.  Take out tastes just as good as eating in!!",

But, besides that, the food is pretty decent for Shanghainese.  The owner, staff, and chef seem to actually be Cantonese, but they do make a pretty decent xiaolongbao and beef wrap. Most of the stir fried noodles are also tasty with a subtle hint of wok hei or that wok flavor that\u2019s coveted in good stir fry. Not enough to actually be great, but just hints at being there. They have an amazing egg yolk crusted shrimp (that\u2019s actually cantonese dish) that I highly recommend when coming here.  The mapo tofu wasn\u2019t too good, didn\u2019t have much flavor besides a mala sting.  For dessert, definitely try the fried pumpkin mochi filled with red bean. So tasty and decadent.  Decent addition to the 86th street food scene and I enjoy eating here for sure.",

Soup dumplings is what they are famous for and a great tasting menu. Snacks, appetizers, and even entrees are great for sharing, the portions are decent. My favorite item was the dumplings of course, the drunken chicken, scallion pancakes, and the crab rice cakes. The red bean Pumpkin dessert was excellent as well, sweet but not overly sweet. Served hot. Yummy.  Came on an early Saturday night, 6pm, but dinner rush happened at 7pm and it was easily a packed house. Reservation suggested.",

The interior is very cozy and a lot of cute cartoon characters on the wall. Ordering is super easy. The staff members are efficient and fast. I\u2019d love to go back again for more dumplings.",
