This location is now where you go if you want your sandwiches burned. The worse part was that when I refused to accept burned sandwiches, they toasted new bread and scooped the insides out of the burned sandwich into the new bread and got offended because I wanted the cheese melted. I was not going to buy three sandwiches that was grossing us out to look at. They should have made the sandwiches from scratch. I told them that and they refused and said they were doing me a favor by changing the bread. As if I burned the bread!!!! The other customers in the line were saying they could smell the burn and anyone could see how black the bread had become.  They refused to remake the sandwiches so I took my kids and left.
