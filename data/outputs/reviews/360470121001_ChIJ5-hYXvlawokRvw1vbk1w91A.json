On Saturday evening I stopped in to pick up some delicious burnt ends.  I don't live in Brooklyn, I live in queens but my friend put me on to them and I've been hooked since. When I got all the way home to queens some 40 minutes away.  I realized they had given me half of what I ordered.  I called to make them aware and without hesitation they offered a refund, or I could come back and get the proper order.  I told  them I would come by to pick up my order the following day.  When I went back the following day I explained the situation and they quickly gave me what I ordered and some extra for the trouble.  AND they apologized, SINCERELY.  I would have been satisfied with just what I paid for and the sincere apology that I received. The extra food ensured I'd not only be back, but it inspired me to write this review praising how well they recovered from a mistake.   Bottom line, the barbecue is here is delicious and if you live in Brooklyn what's your excuse I go there from Ozone Park queens!",

Went with a friend and we were not acknowledged when we came in. The person I was with had to ask if someone going to help us or do we need to use an app to order. Both gentlemen behind the counter acted like they were so busy, then one handed off the responsibility of taking our order to the one trying to prep food which to me seemed like he just didn't want to be bothered. Anyway we got rung up, my friend tried to make small talk but the guy at the register didn't respond. He took our order and said someone would call us. We had to wait outside and it was really cold which I didn't like because we are allowed to dine in but I guess they aren't comfortable with that yet despite being legally able to since the 30th. We waited a bit past 35 min, then got tired of freezing and went to check on our order as our food came out. Maybe when they allow people to dine in I'll try them again but takeout leaves a lot to be desired therefore I can't see myself goin back too soon. Mac and cheese with the meat as well as the cornbread was very good, regular mac was ok. Ribs seemed medium rare which I hated. Pulled pork was ok. $30 for 3 drinks which was alcohol esq...like the food - everything was neutral like not bad but not great either. Sucks we spent 80 on eehh food & drinks.",

There were a few slices of banana, and homemade flavored whipped cream. No pudding or custard. It was good, worth trying for sure. Pro tip: Make pudding with bourbon. The pickle chips were half sour, a little sweet, not very crisp; homemade tasting tho. A great compliment to the fat. Chilli Mac and cheese: YES! Chilli pepper spiced brisket cubes on top of Mac and cheese. The cheese sauce was homemade and not just Velveeta! It had a great flavor. Long live the cheese! Spare rib tips: With all BBQ, sometimes you get dry pieces. There were a mixture. I want to try the char siu next time. Two containers of BBQ sauce: Something appropriately sized. And this stuff was great. Tangy, hint of sweetness. Great flavor.",

But when we ordered it yesterday everything was cold and the meat was clearly so old it that it became tough to chew. And we requested extra sauce but received nothing.  I dmed them on Instagram to request store credit as I wanted to continue supporting them, instead of requesting a refund. However, they not only ignored my dm but then I also commented on their post to ask that they reply to me in case they hadn\u2019t seen it and they deleted that.  Terrible customer service.",

Thank goodness we chose to share a tray instead of ordering our own feasts (this was primarily because we were going to a comedy show afterwards and couldn't bring leftovers with us) as it would have been extra wasteful on our parts. The mac n cheese was hard and tasteless. The beans were so tart, I couldn't stomach more than 1 bite. The chopped chicken was dry and so was the brisket. Man, I love brisket so much and always look forward to when I can get some..but this one hurt my feelings lol. Awful food. Maybe I lived in the south too long and just have higher expectations? Maybe they just had a really bad night? I don't know, but I do know I'll never go back. Waste of money. \ud83d\udc4e",

Wait service at the tables, and there's a bar-like area as well. Order by the \"serving\" or fraction of a pound, but be sure the order is repeated back correctly lest you receive something you didn't know you wanted (though the unexpected rib tips were tasty).  Ordering moist (fatty) brisket has been a bit unreliable; on a recent visit it came virtually lean, which was dry and not the greasy, fatty spectacle I have enjoyed in the past. The rib tips were a good value (though I wanted burnt ends), and everything had a heavy smokiness that made the meal better. Greens (vegetarian) continued in that smoky vein. Waffle fries dusted with dry rub excelled, to my surprise.  The barbecue sauce wasn't needed but sure, let's add that to the fries. And the sweet tea would make a Southerner proud. Overall, a solid pre-show stop and that will continue.",

Feels like this menu relies too much on sugar.  Pit beans have a nice smoke.  For me, if youre going to smoke an entire brisket, you may as well offer sliced fatty brisket not just chopped lean mean in sauce with craisins. Collards tasty but did need so much celery.  I find that the lax\u2019d picnic table ambience has ruined server\u2019s perceived responsibilities across the board in BBQ places. Please know the menu, check on customers and be knowledgeable and aware. Or make me order at the counter.  Not a demotion but just a fun story, I was offered the special of the day Rib Tips and a Beer for $13, and I said oh thanks I don\u2019t drink. Server responded, why would that matter (confused). I said oh because half of that special is booze \ud83d\ude43.",

Second  $32 for 2 brisket sandwiches on hamburger bread and 2 seltzer waters. I've never felt so ripped off in my life i actually want me $32 back. The poor little sandwich with cheap bread was barely warm. Guys get your act together before you are forced to close down and please write to me so I can give you my address and you can send me a refund.

The collard greens were 'okay,' but cold, as was the Mac and Cheese sides, and the corn bread also dry and not what corn bread should be.

I've only been to Fletchers twice but I'm making a point to return. The pulled pork sandwich was rich in flavor, almost falling off the fluffy potato roll, and required no added sauce. The pulled rib sandwich was as delicious as it was messy. Some may be turned off by the bare-bones presentation, self-service and the messy way the meat falls off the bun, but it's a nod to some true whole-hog bbq I've had served on paper plates in Hemingway, South Carolina. That being said, in my opinion this presentation and service seemed contrived when I was the only one in the restaurant at the time. You could bring me my food and ring me up later. It may seem trivial but the stools were a tad bit low for the beautiful wooden tables, and I'm 6 feet tall. The restaurant itself needs some breaking in. I can't put a finger on it, but without a lively eat-in crowd, I felt rather awkward eating there. My suggestion would be to hold events, BBQ sampler parties, or altogether advertise the space more. The staff seemed genuinely interested in the craft of BBQ and Fletcher the owner seems sincere about what he's doing. No doubt, I'll be coming back. Help me break this place in, so the vibe matches the soulful food.",

Anyway, if you're ever in the Brooklyn area, give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.",

We were hungry but didn't want to spoil our appetite so we didn't want to order too much.  We shared the lamb ribs (3 bones), Burnt ends, the duck wings (3 drums), and a medium collar greens. The lamb ribs and burnt ends were too fatty but very juicy (makes sense). And the duck wings were chewy and dry but had a great smokey flavor. We admired the exotic cuts of meats. We could have been safe by ordering the brisket but we didn't. I liked the cafeteria style and they had cool drink. The collar greens did help cut the greasiness and served as a good palate cleanser. A cocktail would have been better but we had somewhere else to go. I liked that the bathroom had hot water and paper towels to help wash of my hands. I despise places with no hot water!  It's unfortunate that I do not venture to this part of town but i'm glad picked this place to wet my appetite. I do wish bbq places give corn bread with every entree like in Jersey but I understand peeps gotta make $.",

It has a cafeteria feel and a popular spot for families, so be warned. Solid beer offerings and very friendly and helpful staff.

Had some pulled pork, burnt ends (fatty and flavorful), cornbread and overly cheesy (but a good thing) mac and cheese.

Very small bar and small selection on beers on tap although I enjoyed my Brooklyn IPA anyway but huge selection of bourbon and whiskey. Very friendly staff who walked me away from the bar and showed me and explained all the meats they had to offer. Very knowledgeable and friendly and I could tell he had a passion for what he was doing. Looking for a smokehouse I'd recommend giving this place a chance.",

I realize that barbecue is largely focused on meat but not having a vege option is poor form. Brisket is excellent, and by far the best thing they make. Pork is ok, nothing special. Ditto goes for the chips, which fail to hit the spot. There aren't many tables in Pier 57, and the few that were there were occupied, despite the hour, inclement weather, and recent opening. I imagine seating will become scarcer still as time goes by. Swing by for a brisket sandwich and pleasant service, and enjoy the funky, arty space that is Pier 57.",
