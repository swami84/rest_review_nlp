I ordered Papaya salad, Pad Thai Lobster, Pad ped Squid, Lychee Nitro tea, and turmeric ginger herbal hot tea. The only decent items were the Papaya salad and the Lychee Nitro tea. Everything else was very low quality and over priced(I ended up paying more than $70). All of this was topped by a terrible customer service. Once the food was ready, there were no napkins or forks and knives, we had to ask for those separately and over multiple times. I do not recommend this restaurant at all, you can get much better quality Thai food elsewhere in town for much cheaper and a better customer service.",

We then asked the server for a new dish and he agreed to give us whatever we would like as long as it did not have the allergy in it. Then when we asked whether the allergy that she had was in the dish, he said no it was not. Once our order was replaced, a new server (supposedly the manager) complained to us that the fish from the order that was returned was very RARE and EXPENSIVE. She then said that the server would usually have to pay for dishes that were brought back to the kitchen. After we explained to her that our intention was not to have the server pay but only to replace the dish, she ran back and told the server a completely different story. The server then storms to our table and says \"DID YOU SAY THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR MEAL AND THAT I NEVER TOLD YOU WHAT WAS IN THE DISH?\" My friend and I were baffled by his expression and tone because he was intending on arguing with us and blaming us for this manager's miscommunication. Overall, the manager told us that their was no component of the allergy in the food when in reality there was. This could have been an extremely dangerous situation and then the staff proceeded to blame us for their mistake. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE YOUNG AND A POC.",

Do not dine in here just go somewhere else and relieve yourself of having to deal with the TERRIBLE SERVICE of this restaurant. We waited exactly 70 minutes before we got our food and the table next to us who had gotten there about 30 minutes after us got their food before us. It was my first time dining in here having heard such great things before and I was very DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED with both the food and their service.  We ordered the chicken pad Thai which I normally love everywhere else (it was horrible) and the melting lava sushi (very disgusting). Let me forget to mention they charged us DOUBLE for the pad Thai unbelievable!!!!!!!!  Our waiter was Britney and she put very minimum effort in her job. It is unfortunate because there are so many unemployed people who would be more than happy to have a job and people like this do not value their job at all!",

For dinner I had the house \u201cIfItIs...\u201d curry with chicken. It was so creamy, rich, hearty, a warm spice and their butterfly pea rice is lightly sweet. A magical blend! Our waiter was so nice and he liked that I had questions about the food. I\u2019m a waitress and I usually don\u2019t enjoy too many questions about our food so it was refreshing to be taken care of someone who was so patient.

Once the food showed up it was flavorless and bland how it is still open is beyond me. To too everything off when we asked for a box for the \"leftovers\" the server comes back and states \"sorry they're no good we mixed them with other food\". So what you're saying is you threw away my food thanks great job. I would rather eat road kill then dine here again. I would have had a better dinner at Mc Donald's at least there I expect to be disappointed.",

It took almost thirty minutes to get our food ordered, the waitress kept checking on the same table, a table that was right next to my own, multiple times but did not once ask if we were ready to order when she would pass by during that time.  The portion size was a bit small for it's price. I have had bigger portions at the same price in many other Thai restaurants. Thank God we ordered multiple appetizers, though with difficulty as the waitress didn't inform us what was sold out on until we asked for each individually. The Pad Thai we ordered was the blandest I have ever had. We ordered hot and it had no spice to it at all.  And the night just ended even worse. The waitress asked if we wanted the left over curry to which I responded Yes. She came back out a minute later and checked if I had said yes that I wanted it. She came back later after I had already paid the check with the tip to say she was sorry but the curry got other food in it. How the heck do you get other food in someone's leftovers if you were supposed to box it up? Sounds more like she forgot and had already tossed it before confirming with me that I had wanted it. She didn't even offer any compensation for the lost food that I had paid for.  This is the worst experience I have ever had. What a great date night to take my boyfriend on, not. How this place has been rated one of the top Thai places in Gainesville is beyond me. 100% would never recommend this place. I wish this could be negative stars!",

        "caption": "Absolutely fantastic, innovative Thai/Japanese fusion restaurant, right in the heart of downtown Gainesville. That authentic style Thai \"Doo-Dee\" bowl you're looking at and I happily devoured is great.  \"If It Is\" claims to be the first restaurant in the US to serve Doo Dee. (Stop laughing at the name, folks.) It's a unique variant of a Tom Yum style soup and noodle based dish. You get a choice of 4 or 5 different noodle types, plus protein types. I went with the seafood, which had may scallops, mussels, calamari, and a few more. Chicken, pork, tofu, beef, combos also possible.  Spice options range from \"Not Spicy, Mild Spicy, Medium Spicy, Spicy, Thai Spicy.\" Suggest you order medium spicy if you want a moderate but noticeably spicy bite. Given the authenticity, and my \"spicy but not too spicy\" preference, I was overly cautious with mild spicy and will go medium spicy next time.  Meanwhile the lunch special my spouse had, in the background, is served on a plank. Wonderful Pad Thai that was very close to the style we had in Thailand rather than at many US Thai places, salad, California roll that was really a step above the usual (yes I snagged a piece), and a Miso soup.  Full sushi menu. Beyond the usual sushi, sashimi, rolls and special rolls, they also have imported or distance-sourced specials that rarely are in Japanese restaurants here. When we were there, they had actual sea eel nigiri with anago imported from Japan, not the common freshwater eel. And Giant Clam geoduck flown in from Washington State. Both were pricey, at $12.95 and $10.95 per piece, but that's reasonable given rarity here and transport. Was tempted but went with the Doo-Dee.  Very good service too.  Definitely try If It Is. We will be dining there again!",

Delicate notes of apple and pear were abundant in this clear dry selection. For people not aware of certain sake, there are descriptions of each of the selections on their extensive drink menu. The miso, which is surprisingly overlooked in many restaurants was made to perfection, with just enough miso without making the broth grainy or overpowered. The rice for the sushi was cooked well, with just the right ratio to compliment the fish. Their Otoro was fairly priced and butter on your tongue, the wonderfully marbled tuna shining brightly in true nigiri fashion. The other sushi was superb to say the least. Every soup, noodle dish and side did not disappoint in the least, surpassing my every expectation. I would reccomend this establishment to anyone passing or living in the Gainesville area.",

IF IT IS is the perfect place for a special occasion. The consistency and quality are top-notch. You can taste the freshness, and the flavors were amazing and made with such care. The ambience is great for a date night or even hang out with friends.  So if you have never done real omakase before, do a quick Google search on etiquette and if you have any questions at all, do not be afraid to ask chiefs who are friendly, helpful, and professional.  I do not know what to say besides this is the best sushi in town. No, I must say one of the best in Florida!  I have 17pieces nigiri with house made soup for starter and end with dessert.  I would revisit to try their regular menu for sure:))))",

Argumentative manager do not lie about us being an hour early because that is an outright lie!

We don't control how many reservations you take but made ours well in advance and we also dont have control over your menu but you absolutely shoukd get better control of your ability to get the food out in a somewhat timely manner.

(It comes marinated and then served with additional spicy mayo and eel sauce on top, I had them leave the extra sauces off.)

Ordered a fish all around roll, which did not arrive for about an hour. It was deeply unimpressive and not just because of the incredibly slow service for this roll. Others at the table received their food about fifteen minutes earlier, noodle dishes. Another member of the party had to wait even longer for her roll to arrive. Mark out a couple of hours on your calendar for lunch here.  As far as the food I ordered, mayo on cream cheese dominated the flavors. The texture of the fish on the outside was okay, though I discovered I'm not the biggest fan of baked escolar. This was probably not the roll for me. The garnishes on the plate had no purpose other than to give you something to look at. Spiralized beets, and a dry and unseasoned seaweed hairball. There was also a small section of turnip (?) which looked uncomfortably like a bite of apple placed on my plate. The preparation seemed to have been executed by someone who has seen food on Instagram and decided that visual appeal is the only factor that they needed to take into account. If you just want to take pictures, then you might be satisfied with this.  Two of our party got perfectly serviceable standard fare, pad Thai and fried rice. They were pretty happy with the way their food turned out, but it's hard to mess that stuff up.  One of our party, who enjoys Thai dishes, ordered \"Doo Dee\" noodles with pork, which apparently tasted strangely and they consumed only part of the dish. The remainder of our party enjoyed their food, including an \"uni shooter\" that looked fascinating to me.  It's also pretty expensive. I usually don't care, since the usual trade-off is that I get good food in exchange. Unfortunately, this is not a guarantee that they will provide enjoyable or skillfully executed dishes or even attentive service. Consider any of their nearby competitors a better option at similar prices.  If you want some food related visual simulation or a very standard dish, this place is an option. However, given the poor service and culinary disappointment, I'll give this place a wide berth from now on.",

I can recommend the Green Curry, Papaya Salad and Tom Yum soup. There is also a robust drink menu, with \"Gator\" inspired cocktails, to wine, and a large sake offering (the $5.00 house sake was great for it's price).

Our waitress was nice and clearly experienced but the service as a whole seemed very disorganized and not great. To name a few from our last visit, the hostess was wearing an inside out t-shirt and sat us at a dirty table with no place settings, water glasses, menus( eventually a waitress (not ours) came over and took care of these things), our sushi appetizer came out after our entrees even though the waitress said she spoke with them, among other things. Unfortunately for a place that charges what they do this is quite unacceptable. The food could be worth the prices they charge but the price is definitely not proportional to the quality of service, especially with the amount of high quality restaurants with great service in the vicinity of this place. I'll probably go back in a month or two to see if they are able to address these issues (maybe it's just growing pains?) but if they still continue to charge the prices they do while providing sub-par service, I'll probably take this place off my list of where to go out to eat.",

Dishes were brought out one at a time, which is to be expected with authentic Thai cuisine.  When those dishes arrived, every single one was phenomenal.  The food quality is on par with that of some of the highest-rated Thai restaurants in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.  I'd highly recommend the Doo-Dee Noodle--the flavors and textures in that dish complement perfectly.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous and creates a very nice classy American Thai fusion atmosphere.  I would chalk up any spotty issues with service to the fact that the restaurant is nearly brand new.  This place deserves a full crowd!",

Not a single person came to the table. I alerted a waitress that we had not been seen, even for waters, and she simply replied \u201coh, okay\u201d. I went back to my table and waited an additional five minutes, we still had no one come to see us. We finally got up to leave and I asked to speak to a manager (mostly because I had really enjoyed this place the first time I had dined here and wanted to alert them of this issue). The waitress seemed unwilling to let me speak to anyone. They were not consolitary in any way and were quite dismissive of the whole situation. I am extremely disappointed because I had really raved about this place to my family before I brought them here. I will not go back.

        "caption": "What a disappointing dinner and a joke of a restaurant.  Had dinner with the wife. Menu is 8 pages large with two separate menus for happy hour (that ends at 5?) and cocktails. Troubling sign to have so much on the menu.  We order: 1. Hot appetizer 2. Sashimi 3. Sushi roll 4. Masaman curry And drinks to boot.  I say \u201cfirst we will begin with a hot appetizer\u201d and continue with the order.  3 minutes later, the curry comes with room temp rice.  There is no silverware. There are no plates. No one comes for 5 minutes to ask about food or bring these items. I got up and collected my own utensils and plateware.  The curry is souplike in consistency with no thickness, no heat whatsoever despite being ordered \u201cvery spicy\u201d and is bland. I ask the waiter why the curry came out first. Response?  \u201cYou put it all on one ticket so its whatever is ready first gets served first.\u201d  Say what?  Sashimi tasted like unfrozen tilapia.  Sushi deep fat fried and still didnt taste good.  Hot app came out last, whitefish and was bland an unpalatable.  Drinks have no alcoholic component to them, my cocktail with hibiki japnese whiskey is drowned in juice to the point of being indistinguishable from the sugary fruit drink.  This cost over $80. What a f*&king joke. The hard and fast rule still holds true, if a place tries to do too much they do nothing well. I obviously wont be going back into this disappointing money pit, and hope you avoid the same fate by reading this word of warning.",

I ordered lobster pad Thai and the waitress came back after 5 minutes and said they were out so I asked for MILD beef pad Thai. We got 3 out of 4 food that our table ordered. We started eating and my food was super spicy. I tried the food my husband had and that was not as spicy. We asked the waitress to change the food. She expalained that they are sometime inconsistent with spice level. Shortly after, the dish was redone. The 4th fish our table ordered is still not here. My food had a burning smell and tasted bitter. At this point, I do not want them to redo my food but what really bothers me is that the waiter tells me the burning taste is because it is \u201cAuthentic\u201d. In addition to all of this, we paid for  a dish that I didn\u2019t eat. Very disappointing! I will not go back",

Cons:Their appetizer platter was a sad affair though, the sauces were delicious but the dumplings were cold soggy and oily. The chicken potstickers were dry and cold, and the tofu was cardboard. Their staff needs more practice too, just small things like refilling the water pitcher or getting plates and silverware  when the food comes is something that needs more attention.

Admittedly, this may just be my Americanized palate, but I like it a bit more sweet and less salty. 3 star spice level was perfect - just spicy enough to make me sweat but not be uncomfortable.

My coworker asked the host who sat us about the nigiri; the host replied he had been working there only a day, and to wait for our server (ok, no big deal). We both ordered an appetizer, and that's when things started going downhill. My appetizer came out on a comically large wooden pizza peel which took up the entire table; his, shortly thereafter, on a normal-sized plate (he ordered to pieces of nigiri). From that point, we did not see our server again until the end of meal. We ran out of water pretty early, and we could not get in touch with the server. Still, we waited. After about 20 min, my main course came out (beef pad thai). The odor coming from the plate made both my coworker and me absolutely nauseous--neither one could eat more than a bite--and I ended up leaving the entire plate there. After an additional 30 min, a total of about an hour now, the server finally came back. She asked my coworker, who had still not received his sushi, if he were still waiting on his sushi. Yes, he was. She explained that \"[they] sent the other sushi chef home this morning, so there's only one guy in the back making sushi\" and that it would be an additional 5-10 min. At this point, our lunch hour was over, and my coworker indicated that. She offered to bring out a box for him so that when it arrived, he could box (not box it to go behind the kitchen or anything). She went away and came back with a box shortly. After another 10 minutes, she came out with her tablet and explained the order had never gotten to the kitchen. At that point, we asked for our checks. She came out and handed us the checks, nonchalantly stating \"next time you come back, we'll have a full staff.\" Aside from the Stygian service, the bill totaled over $30 for my friend and $20 for me. For a $50 lunch we received one edible appetizer.  TL;DR: If you like fasting, hate service, love foul smelling food, and hate money, give it a try.",

Glad to see new high quality Asian options in the city.  Service was on the slower side, but this could be attributed to the wait stuff working out the kinks before the opening. Definitely worth a trip.",

We had the Thai coffee and lunch special Curry and Pad Thai.  Don't go in expecting chopsticks - Thai people mainly eat with spoons and they don't use chopsticks much at all and Don't order Thai spicy unless you're crazy! You can always ask for the spice tray to add spice if you want to.  We were only there for the soft opening but will be back asap. The place was perfect. I would not recommend sitting outside - it smells really bad and there's nothing that they can do about that.",

I overheard my neighbor say \u201che hasn\u2019t had flavors this quality in the States\u201d and I may have to agree. Had the lunch menu Pad Thai, which was large enough to share for two and the perfect bite of sour, sweet, salty, and spicy. I look forward to trying the wiggly crustaceans next time!",

Surprised to learn this is the first location opening in the United States. I was unfamiliar with the brand but after some quick research, the fusion-confusion aspects from decor, menu design, and food selections have to deliberate. This unpredictable dining experience (I had so many questions) adds to the charm actually, and reminded me of meals overseas.",

I'm a little confused by the decor but that's a minor detail. My companions ordered the Pad Thai lunch special and the Red Curry lunch special. They said the noodles weren't quite right and both were comparable to Taste dishes. I ordered pork gyoza, and the filling itself was tasty but the wrapper was pretty dried out. My companions and I also agree there are a few cosmetic changes that could go into the menu. Overall I'm looking forward to coming back during or after the grand opening for a larger meal and a cup of tea!",
