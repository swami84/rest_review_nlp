Like 8 - 8.5 almost 9 lol. I enjoyed it but definitely not for those who turn red from a little black pepper lol  ---  The entrees I ordered the butter chicken ( my favorite) and asked for a piece of chicken Tika masala  to make sure I wasn't missing anything.  Enjoyed the butter chicken more. The gravy was rich and although it had a sweeter forward taste than the masla, it was just as hot!  The chana was cool. I'm not to crazy about chickpeas so there's that. And the vegetable biriani was good as well. The plate comes with rice already so kinda wish I would've gotten the spinach to round it out.

I especially how much meat they included in their curries.  If you do go here, the mango lassi, the chicken dishes, and the Palak paneer are definitely the items that are worth getting -- I'd say they're all above average for an Indian restaurant in this price category.  However, the service is disorganized and slow even when there aren't many other people in the restaurant, and there's no option for a half-portion so it's hard to go here with others without wasting a lot of extra food at the end of the meal.  They also don't let you choose the spice level, which varies considerably across the entrees and is spicier than my absolute preference for some of the dishes.  I appreciate that this is probably more a testament to my own personal low spice tolerance than anything about this restaurant, but it is disappointing given that there are only five or so entrees offered that additional ones will be knocked off the menu for either being too spicy or not spicy enough depending on your preference for heat.  The chana masala and the biryanai were below average as well.  Overall, I'd recommend it for people with a high spice tolerance who are looking for a giant meal for a reasonable price, but if you just want great Indian food I'd recommend choosing another place in the area.  You might pay the same amount for less food but you'll be able to choose what dish you get and how much you want to eat in the meal.",

It's enough to feed you two meals easily. The food is a little spicy with the chicken tikka masala spicier than the butter chicken. For drinks, they have bottled options including Honest Tea.

I wish I could order just a side of the vegetable rice sometimes when I'm coming home because the meal size is very large and sometimes all I want is a little order of the veggie rice. An order is an entree with 2 sides and the portion is big enough that I can easily save half of it for a later meal or lunch the next day. Best Paneer I've ever had actually. The food is probably a little spicy for white people and wimps like myself but it clears my sinuses and makes me feel warm for the rest of the day during this chilly winter weather so I'm not really complaining.",

The saag paneer i ordered tasted like frozen spinach hastily mixed without the correct spices or cream, chief amongst those absent is salt.  The sides offered are chana masala (chickpeas) and spicy biryani. The chana masala is at least palatable, but both dishes are way too spicy. Every dish has a weird artificial flavor that is honestly repulsive. I tried eating the leftovers of my meal the next day but lost my appetite for everything save the chickpeas.  If you want a good Indian meal, try Indigo on 3rd and K. You can smell the cumin from that place a block away, as they are definitely getting their spices right, especially on vegetarian dishes.  Sad to see Red Boat replaced by such a thoughtless effort to leech off of Indigo\u2019s popularity and the rise of Indian cuisine.",
