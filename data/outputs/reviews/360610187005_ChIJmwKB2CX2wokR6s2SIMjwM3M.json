Can try their lamb chop and grilled beef ribs which is a little bit cozy. Spicy pork wonton and  Chong pork dumpling are not bad too. Cold dish i used to have their shredded potato and cucumber salad. Tried the above stuff since the lockdown. Overall not too bad.",

The chicken came doused in pepper oil. I can handle spice really well and this was a little hard for me. At the end of the meal, my lips and tongue were unpleasantly tingly and numb. The wontons were not fresh at all and the broth was horrendous. It was just spicy salt water with A TON of pepper.

They have a healthy selection of Chinese dishes that are reminiscent of restaurants found in China. The cucumber dish and the eggplant dish were delicious. I hope to go back again to try the whole fish dishes. Staff was very nice and the taste of the food was very good. If you are searching for an \"authentic Chinese taste\" on the Upper West Side. Check this place out.",

I got a small plate of THE CHEAPEST, MOST DISGUSTING diced pieces of BOILED chicken (the way they do it in the $1 places in Chinatown for soup broth), and HALF of these little pieces were cartilage and bone. I was furious. I went up to the counter, put my plate and tray by the register, and told the guy \"That I paid $8 for 80 cents worth of boiled chicken is a travesty. You should be ashamed.\".
