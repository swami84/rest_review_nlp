Everyone standing outside was angry that the server was extremely slow and not prepared to handle a Friday night rush. If she had hustle in her step and a bit of focus, all can be forgiven. However after waiting 45 - minutes for our food as it sat on the counter and standing outside amongst other angry hungry people was not cool. I understand everyone is under staffed or cutting back staff due to Covid, however this place was a mess and should have at least another server to handle the load.  But the food delicious. Just don't go on a Friday night and be prepared to wait a while for your food and it may not be hot when you get it.  Everyone was cursing the server under their breath. Tragic.",

Edamame was good and  the chicken wings were tasty but could have been tossed in the sauce instead of it just being layed on top. They could definitely added more octopus to their takoyaki even though it usually only has a small piece of leg you would think they sliced it with a mandolin.

But that was the only draw back. The decor was simple yet elegant. I liked the little Mason jar with the LED lights in it turned upside down. Very innovative, very Brooklyn. Our service was excellent, prompt and courteous. The place was packed (a good sign) and people were walking in still trying to carve out their own inch, so prompt service that you can eat and go is a must at this obviously popular restaurant. We ordered the duck bun to start and a beef ramen for me and a pork ramen for my Jewish friend. Don't ask. In a word...delicious. Very tender and flavorful pieces of meat, veggies and al dente noodles all having a ball swimming in a deliciously tasty and balanced broth. So satisfying that we couldn't waste spoonful of deliciousness with conversation. We were only left with Mmm's, and Ohh's when we found another interesting spoonful. Besides we had to finish so that the others waiting outside could get their turn. I'll be back, with my other big friends.",

PS this is 5 star compared to other NYC ramen, can't compare this to ramen in Japan or some places like Mu Ramen in LIC is fantastic as well but much much pricier, for $12/13 a bowl here it hits the spot!  Additional, finally ate here dine in and the service was excellent! They filled water glasses without asking and gave extra napkins without asking either.

For me, it's cheaper than a $20 cocktail and definitely a lot more art and work.  How does it taste? I love the broth. I can taste the time and effort to make that thick broth. If you order a spicy noodle, you ruin the taste. I love spicy but not really in ramen. It's like putting a screen protector on an iPhone screen. What a waste. Anyway, i suggest the egg. If not in your noodle selection, you can ask to a dd it for some $$ of course.  Ramen is really good. Here and also for your belly. Portion is a bit enough? I will always complain about portion being small thou. It's enough to make you feel happy but not totally full.  I was here at 7:30pm on a weekday and it's totally empty or maybe another table leaving. Ever since that other ramen place  closed 6 blocks away by Hoyt, this is probably the only one left in the area or at least one of the best. I wouldn't come often because I don't spend $16 on casual dinner everyday. I am a make my own dinner or go for the $5 gyro kind of person. In the end, I think you should try this place.
