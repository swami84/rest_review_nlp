You have to call ahead of time to ask if they have the vegan mac available, as apparently the Daiya is a hot commodity in BK and they have trouble getting their hands on it.  Took a few days of calling to finally land on a day when they had it.  The medium size (they call it small) was a filling size for a meal.  I wanted to try the 'vegan bridge', but i had to keep calling until they had vegan cheese again.  One day I was put on hold for 18 minutes, and then they hung up on me. I called back immediately, they put me back on hold for 5 mins and then I gave up on trying with this place. Hopefully they can improve their reliability in the future, or even figure out how to make their own vegan cheeses so they aren't reliant on products.",

This place delivers.  At $7 for a \"value sized\" mac - at least a meal's worth - it's good value for money, and cheesy as all heck. The crust was crunchy, the noodles al dente (I suspect they were cooked, or at least sauced, on the spot). The woman behind the counter, who was possibly also the sole cook, was extremely nice. I opted for the Classic, but I can't wait to go back and try some of the other cheese combinations and the vegan options.  Is there room for improvement? Sure. It would have been nice to have some more sauce options, or at least salt and pepper. I personally prefer a soupier b\u00e9chamel and a more judicious approach to cheese. But let me tell you, when I was marching down Fulton Street on a grim, icy Tuesday night and this place swam into view - warm and glowing amidst the shuttered storefronts - I felt heaven was smiling upon me.",

Delivery came a few minutes early (yay!), but driver couldn't deliver to the door so I had to come down (boo).  The wings were ok, I really enjoyed the mango sauce that was sprinkled around the container (but not on the actual wings? lol). The mac was super spicy (MUCH spicier than the wings... which was interesting because they were both supposed to be jerk). I really appreciate that they have vegan options for the macs, but I wish it wasn't Daiya. If there was a cashew based cheese they offered, I think it would make the vegan macs 10x's better. My favorite part was actually the iced tea/lemonade. THAT was exceptional!",

In the corner by the forks I noticed a large bag of snow salt which easily could have been behind the counter but was instead in an area where people are eating. I ordered. I sat for nearly thirty minutes as I watched the cashier frantically answer the phone multiple times attempting to keep up with the online orders that probably attribute to the majority of their business because frankly I don't see it in house. As the minutes past the store filled. Understaffed is an understatement. Who ever owns this place appears to not care anymore. Half the menu wasn't available for purchase 'because the items were popular' meanwhile all I requested was anything vegan. They went as far as to tell me they ran out of bread for grilled cheese (this is a restaurant that advertises their grilled cheese which is what brought me there in the first place). To say the least the experience of coming here was abysmal. I put two stars because the food wasn't aweful but it wasn't anything to wright home about. Overall a dud. Avoid.",

Not amazing, but just okay. The second time I visited was about a year later. Unfortunately the entire dish was burned, and tasted like nothing but burned material. It even stunk up my house. I had to throw the whole thing out & take the garbage out too.  I've visited for a third time, now a couple of years after the second time. Firstly, I've never seen the store so dirty. It was empty, it seemed they had no orders coming in, yet the floor was sticky & the paint job in combination is making the place look really dreary. Well, the food wasn't burned this time, at least. It's just that the food literally tastes like water. There's no seasoning whatsoever on it, the actual macaroni have no sauce whatsoever on them, and the whole thing tastes like not even a pinch of salt was used. I waited way too long for the dish to be finished to get this tasteless plate.  My best suggestion to anyone considering going here is to simply go to the grocery store a couple of blocks away, buy the ingredients, go home and make it yourself, from a recipe on the internet. This was an utter waste of time and $10.00 for me tonight. Never again.",

There is a minimum 25 minute wait for food that you pretty much must take out as there is really just two bar stools available for seating. A gentrified community member came in with her dog, and the interaction between the client and the man at the desk was incredibly uncomfortable. She was extremely rude and he was essentially hitting on her as we all stood and continued to wait for our food.  Worst of all, while waiting, I realized I did not see the health inspection notice posted anywhere (against the law). Never a good sign. I decided to look it up and immediately found the grade was pending, YUCK. No surprise, the facility looked unkempt.  As we had already ordered, we tried the buffalo chicken mac and the regular mac, with a lemonade which was promised to be \"worth the wait\". The lemonade was lime green, definitely not natural by any means. It honestly looked like lime Gatorade. Tossed it. The buffalo mac was better in taste, had some flavor to it, however the chicken left much to be desired. It tasted like the chicken you find in your campbells chicken noodle soup. In regards to the regular mac and cheese, it lacked flavor. Both were edible, just certainly nothing to write home about or pay $10.00 for.  Don't waste your time. Look elsewhere for a delicious mac & cheese.",

Their excuse when I called after 2 hours of waiting was that they had messed up my vegan mac and cheese the first time and hadn't made them vegan so had to remake them. I still don't see how this makes anything 2 hours long of a wait??\ud83e\udd14  I ordered the 1 small Vegan Veggie Mac and 1 small Vegan Jerk Mac. My friend ordered 1 large Buffalo Mac. While he enjoyed his mac and cheese I would NOT order from here again, at least delivery. I have been excited to try some other vegan mac and cheese however everything was WAY over spiced. The salty taste in the Vegan Veggie was so overpowering that I had to mix it with the Vegan Jerk Mac. I was also upset that my friends Mac came with breadcrumbs but mine didn't? If the bread crumbs aren't vegan there are so many panko breadcrumbs out there that have no egg in it.  Also the prices are ridiculous. To pay $20 for a large or $10-14 for a small is ridiculous. And the charging so much for added toppings.  If you are vegan I'd recommend you go to either \"S,MAC Saritas Mac And Cheese\" (I found it a bit pricy for the portion size and dry usually so was looking for something new) in the city or travel to Queens and get the Vegan Mac and Cheese from \"Veggie Castle II\" (by far the best and creamiest Vegan Mac and cheese and Mac and cheese I've ever had hands down in my opinion) and you can get a whole takeout plate of yummy vegan options for less than $20.  Maybe it was just a bad day for them so I'd possibly give it another go in person but again, I've seen other reviews claiming the same delivery issues, put on a Lord of The Rings movie if you want delivery. It should arrive during the credits...\ud83d\ude44  2/5 And only the 2 stars for my friend enjoying his Mac and cheese and for the effort of having vegan options on the menu.  **Also I called and informed the store of this but to this day on GrubHub it says you guy's vegan options are \"Temporarily Unavailable\" and it's been like this for at least 6 months. You're losing customers due to not changing this btw...",

I WANTED the large and would've bought it at a $12/$13 price point but that was just Outrageous. The shrimp were not even big why does only mac cost practically $10? It should've been more like $7-$8 like shrimp roti, you get way more food... I liked the food but it's way overpriced. Friendly staff too, but not worth it.",
