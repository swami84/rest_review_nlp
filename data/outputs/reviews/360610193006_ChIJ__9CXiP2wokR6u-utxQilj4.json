Thoughtful menu that is well executed. You can\u2019t go wrong with anything you order, really. Love the burger and all the apps! So glad to see them reopen with the warmer weather \u2014 we plan to be regulars with our newborn in his stroller. Support this place, people!",

This differed from our experience with other bars so we asked for clarification and were told it was a new regulation from Governor Cuomo just that day. Couldn't find it posted anywhere and seemed unlikely since regulations have been loosened recently, not tightened. Food, which was delicious, came, was eaten, still no cocktails, the purpose of our visit there. When we inquired, the bartender hadn't even stared making them yet. We should have cancelled the drinks order at that point but instead ended up slamming then back quickly so we could make our reservations. Not at all the experience we were hoping for. Staff was very good about masks and sanitizing tables.",

My review prior to this shows how appreciative we are of the basic little things and that most if not all of my reviews are always about commending places and the good stuff.  Anyway.. Days prior, I was planning my birthday brunch with friends and since I really wanted to check out this place given all the 'good' reviews, the general plan was to stay Uptown then. That's fine because most of us live in UWS anyway and one lives in UES. We walked 11 blocks from W. 97th and arrived here at 4PMish. We were coming in next to a small group of older customers and since the place wasn't even 20% occupied, we were given the choice to which table to take. We took the one behind/beside the bar since we were 5 and could fit in, also following through our little private space from our brunch earlier. Pretty nice, despite the fact that the place was really hot. Overall, we liked the vibe of the place and the music. We were at least greeted hello by the guy in white shirt. I knew that you order by the bar so some of us ordered ahead then my husband and I followed and did too. The Asian bartender took our orders in a nonchalant way, turned his back from us, and I had to ask and offer my card, to which he says, \"we already have a card from your table. You can ask us how to split it later.\" Again, unfriendly tone. Like why? Did you woke up on the wrong side of the bed and you hate the world? Anyway, we're all professionals and always believe in taking the high road, so we let it slide since we're there to celebrate. We could already feel something wasn't right though.  Drinks were finally made for our group of 5. The Asian guy puts it by the side for us to get, no issues really. And then we started to observe how different we were treated from the other tables. First off: they actually 'interacted' nicely with them. Second: they actually brought the drinks to their tables. Third: the rest of the tables were given a bottle of water and glasses. Now this was the little test that we wanted to see if there was some discrimination happening. I asked nicely, could we please have some water? The asian guy says, you can get it yourself and pointed a corner where the pitcher of water is made available. My friend stood up and got it for me and then we noticed another table who was served water again. Well, wow. That was the turning point. We were there to check out and support a new business which describes themselves as a 'friendly neighborhood bar'. I'm a regular at The Penrose in UES and Salon de Ning at the Pen\u00ednsula and they are not stuck up people. I also enjoy Danny Meyer's restaurants esp. Manhatta and Don Angie and their restaurant group and they are fantastic, expensive, yet so worth it, because of their friendliness and quality of food and drinks. We were prepared to stay for hours and try everything but I guess they're not into 'diversity'. We still left them a good tip because that's the right thing to do but even as we walked out the door, considering they weren't even 50% full, there was no thank you or anything.  There were 2 restrooms btw (that's pretty good, rare even), however one didn't have running water and the one didn't have any bathroom tissue.  Nobody told us that our experience would be subpar so we got out of there as soon as we finished one round and checked out Dive106 which was across the street. Turns out, their 5 star reviews are pretty legit. We ended up staying for the next 4 hours. A place we would happily come back and tell people about. :)  Moral of the story: You don't judge a bar by its cover.",

This place will become known as a snacker\u2019s paradise because of dishes like the blistered shishito peppers and the ch\u00e8vre arancini. But don\u2019t feel shy about sitting here for dinner as well. The fried chicken sandwich is one of the best in the city.
