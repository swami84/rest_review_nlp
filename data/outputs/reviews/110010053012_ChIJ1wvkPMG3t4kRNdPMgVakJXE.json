The only thing I really enjoyed was the appetizer which had potato, chicken salad, diced tomatoes, some sort of sauce, and olives. The entree was shredded chicken in some sort of sauce which honestly has no taste. There was a random boiled egg that brought nothing to dish as well as three small pieces of plain yuca. Don't even get me started on the desert. As you can see in the pic, it looked like something store bought and bite size. Very disappointed.",

They explained the drinks and food menu clearly and steered me away from the basic dishes.  I started with the tostones and was blown away.  It was the simplest yet juiciest pulled pork I have ever had.  It wasn't weighed down with a sauce or spices, but just pure flavor.  There were 3 big portions on the plate! I then had the seafood gyoza which was perfectly crispy and had a good spicy sauce.  There were 7 pieces of gyoza and I ate all of it without hesitation.  I ended with the lamb shank it was fall off the bone delicious.  The portions here are very good sized, the tastes are amazing, and I am disappointed it took so long to find this place.  Will definitely visit again when I am back in town.",

She was attentive to glluten  and dairy allergies and was lovely to us. We ordered the pulpo, tacu tacu, arroz con mariscos, yuquitas, and the Mochica cebiche and all of it was delicious. The flavors of the cebiche and the crunch of yucca was an excellent choice together. The pulpo was nice, served as a whole piece. I was really surprised at how much I like the tacu tacu which has the consistency of a thick vegan patty. And finally, their espressos  are fantastic! They get the crema effect without the dairy. All in all, it was a wonderful experience! It's more of a fine dining experience than what I've been used to in other Peruvian places so you have to be prepared for that. I'll definitely return!",

The ceviche Mixto had only 2 shrimp in it. The ceviche Mochica was a bit more generous with the octopus slices, but both Mixto and Mochica consisted primarily of white fish slices. We liked it better than the ceviche at Pisco y Nazca, but it could be a lot better since it is not difficult at all to get excellent quality fresh fish and seafood in the DC area.",

Two tables had apparently asked to move and much of the noise was attributed to our table.  I should note our waitress was fantastic, however, the male manager clearly applied unique treatment to us.  I'm not sure if it was more the fact that there was no sound barrier for a group of 9+ people and the rest of the floor, or the fact that we were the largest table, but the rest of the floor was similarly at a noise level one might expect if about 50-100+ people sat across 5000sf split between two floors.  While the food was delicious, be careful about how you look because apparently if you are a large group of people at a table (on a Friday night at 6-10pm) and include a few minorities, they may awkwardly imply you're being too loud despite the consistent noise throughout.  Unbelievable, will never go back.",

This is one of those places. They brought our ceviche appetizer out within a couple minutes of ordering.  Not sure why, but luckily I ordered the app first to avoid too-fast service.  You'll definitely want to be a control freak with regard to service here if you don't want to be disappointed.  2. The Octopus also came out very fast, however we waited until we were ready to order it. Still, it came out so fast that the impression was it was meant for another table and given to us. The dish was good but a bit on the chewy side and a little salty.  The portion was great.  3. The seafood rice was good but also too salty.  Overall, with some minor service and food improvements, this place could be amazing.",

It's very relaxed and pretty quiet, great for conversations, and the food is just wonderful. Their alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks are unique and just so easy to drink. The appetizers are great, especially the short ribs and yucca fries. I had a seafood dish with a rich sauce, and it was beyond satisfying. The fish was a perfectly cooked and crisped on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside. With shrimp, calamari, and mussel. Perfect.  I finished with the tirimisu. Get the tirimisu. It's flavor and texture are unique - the Shirley of what your expect with a Peruvian twist. It's creamy but structured, and maybe a little like pannacotta.  Would definitely go again on a date night or for a business meal or as a treat. Cheers, Nazca Mochica.",

We were seated next to beautiful tapestries that gave us privacy without making us feel closed in. The waitstaff was, to a person, warm, polite and friendly. At a restaurant of this caliber one often is greeted by snootiness, but this was not the case here. I take off points for the Huancaina sauce that tasted more like watered down Aji Amarillo. There was also no rice served with dishes that require rice. To their credit, we requested rice and it was brought immediately.  One of my companions had Arroz con Pato and the arroz was a bit bland. That was disappointing. My Lomo Saltado was amazing and the Aji de Gallina was as good as can be expected with frozen ajies. All in all, a wonderful experience.

Downstairs is Mochica, a ceviche lounge and pisco bar.  We came for a birthday celebration. It was pretty easy to make reservations a few days before using OpenTable, and the restaurant called to confirm our reservation.  Pisco sours are naturally popular here, although I went with their ginger mint chilcano. Infused with mint, ginger, and lemon grass pisco, my drink also had ginger ale, lime juice, and angostura bitters. It was a tasty concoction that I would go for again and again.  Their ceviches are well-known, but we settled on short-rib antichuchos for a shared appetizer. The short ribs are marinated for 72 hours in an aji panca honey glaze and served with a creamy huancaina sauce, fried yucca, fingerling potatoes, and purple cabbage. The ribs are so tender they fall right off and paired with the various sauces, cabbage, and potatoes, it's one heck of a dish.  For my main course, I went for their lomo saltado. This is beef tenderloin sauteed in soy sauce and sesame oil and served with red onions, roma tomatoes, and fries. A small side of rice comes with the saltado. It's a very homey, comforting dish, and I think it really speaks to me because it's a stir fry dish (lomo saltado originated as part of the chifa tradition or Chinese cuisine of Peru). We were even able to glimpse a little bit of wok action in the kitchen.  Service was very friendly and accommodating. They even presented the birthday boy with their alfajores (Peruvian traditional cookies filled with dulce de leche) on the house. Fantastic place for Peruvian dishes and would definitely frequent Mochica for happy hour.",

The cebiche was really good and the fish was very fresh, and they are very generous with the portions.

It\u2019s a good place for seafood lovers, although they have one of the most ya steaks I\u2019ve ever had. Great for medium to big parties even though it is most of time packed. Service is good, they are very busy but nice attitude.",

Value for money very good. However, another thing is when we talk about the causes. $ 15 for that entree seems to me more than excessive, and the pegotitos of ridiculous sauces. I would suggest you put some more sauce. When I went with my two friends and we saw that there were only 5 sticks we were speechless and a little annoyed. The seafood channel is good but the day I went, too salty, opinion shared by my companion. The service whenever I have gone is very good. I think it's a bar worth going to, it's good, but some dishes more than others. I will definitely go back for cebiche and chili pepper. Thank you!  (Original) La comida est\u00e1 bueno pero puntualizo aqu\u00ed mi punto de vista. El aj\u00ed de gallina es fabuloso  y el cebiche tambi\u00e9n, merece la pena pagar el plato. Relaci\u00f3n calidad precio muy buena. Sin embargo, otra cosa es cuando hablamos de las causitas. 15 d\u00f3lares por ese entrante me parece m\u00e1s que excesivo, y los pegotitos de salsas rid\u00edculos. Les sugerir\u00eda que pusieran algo m\u00e1s de salsa. Cuando fu\u00ed con mis dos amigos y vimos que solo eran 5 pegotes nos quedamos boquiabiertos y un poco molestos. El cau cau de mariscos est\u00e1 bueno pero el d\u00eda que yo fu\u00ed, demasiado salado, opini\u00f3n compartida por mi acompa\u00f1ante. El servicio siempre que he ido es muy bueno. Creo que es un bar al que merece la pena ir, es bueno, pero unos platos m\u00e1s que otros. Definitivamente volver\u00e9 a por cebiche y aj\u00ed. \u00a1Gracias!",

We were a group of 9 and the service was good, only once did we wait a bit longer for drinks but I take this as a more \"real\" experience. Something you'd finding a restaurant in Lima, where you're not hurried or constantly checked on by the wait staff. Overall, I give this place a very enthusiastic two thumbs up and will return again.",

As soon as we arrive the ambiance was good, the decoration very cute, we sat outside. The service was good, the waiters were very attentive. We started with the Causitas, they were good, it looked very appealing, we also had the Mochica Ceviche, which was overcooked and warm (not made fresh), had lots of onions, too little fish and octopus, and two fried calamari on top (we were two so we can\u2019t complain), some dices of fried yuca (never had yucca with ceviche before) and Peruvian corn. As main courses we had the Lomo Saltado and Aji de Gallina, disappointed at the first one, ok with the second one. The meat was extremely over cooked, dry and very little (seven pieces) with lots of onions, lots of fries, it was also over priced (for an extra $10.00 dollars you could get better and 5 times the steak at Ruth Chris). The Aji de Gallina, better say Aji de Pollo, (Gallina = Hen / Pollo = Chicken) very close to the real Aji de Pollo, love the olive, but too little potatoes. Drinks: Maracuy\u00e1 sour (passion fruit) didn't taste that good, and Mochica Algarrobina was missing the Algarrobina. My friend and I left this restaurant feeling unsatisfied after spending close to $150 on dinner, honestly way too expensive for mediocre food, for two people.",

They also have a lunch special for Pan con Chicharron which can only be described as a sandwich you would wait in a around the block line for. If just this sandwich was sold on the street it would be an instant phenomenon.  If you go in and have one thing it should be the Pisco Sour. The drink is expertly crafted and if you have not tried Pisco this will be an excellent first try.",

Service and ambience is half the experience of going to a restaurant, and we were already having a good time before we ordered our food. I've only had Peruvian food a handful of times, but I know that you can't go to a Peruvian restaurant without ordering pisco sours and ceviche. We had the asian cebiche by recommendation of the owner, who visited our table during the meal. I haven't even tried the other cebiches on the menu but this is the best one. It was so good, the combination of flavors was perfect and the fish super fresh. For drinks, we had pisco sours. The foamed egg white on top was the best part, it made the drink super smooth and creamy. We ordered a few more dishes, but the main other thing that stood out was the Kobe beef dish. The meat melted in our mouths like butter. LIKE BUTTER!! I regret bringing my boyfriend because I wanted this one all to myself. Unfortunately, they were out of their highly recommended steamed pork belly buns, but we'll definitely order them next time, as Abraham said they were a must.",
