My wife and I were excited to try this place for takeout as the menu seemed interesting and had a lot of selection. Unfortunately, they messed up the spice level on our order, so several of the dishes that should have been spicy were mild and vice versa. Worse than that, we each found a scrap of plastic (pictured) in one of our dishes (2 out of 4 dishes). My wife also found a hair in one of her dishes. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the menu is interesting and the dessert dishes were good, but we will not be going back.",

I specifically asked prior to ordering if there are any nuts in the Shahi Paneer. I was told no, all dishes with nuts have a symbol next to it on the menu. I go home and take a bite, and have an allergic reaction. Dug through the curry to find a couple cashews at the bottom.  This happens far too often to people like myself with allergies, so it\u2019s almost pointless to want to take it up in court. However, it\u2019s how you lose business from myself and my family forever. Probably won\u2019t hurt them since these types of businesses don\u2019t care at all, they just want to sell their food.",
