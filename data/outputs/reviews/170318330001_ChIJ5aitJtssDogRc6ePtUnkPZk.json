He liked the steak but loved the ribs. He also got the asparagus which he was amazed by. I am vegetarian so I ordered the gnocchi and as the waitress recommended, I mushroom sauce instead. It was literally the best gnochi I have ever had. I got the broccoli too and it was fantastic as well. I had to take most of it to go, but it reheated even better. We got the flan but that was the only thing I felt like was a ripoff. It was a great taste and texture, but it was so small and the sprinkles confused me LOL so weird and inconsistent with the meal.

It was a fantastic experience, not only because of the food and drink, but the people. From the GM who committed to provide a warm and comfortable experience with the drink selection, to the guys over that hot hearth who put in the time, detail and effort to create the dining journey. The mix of seafood and beef in each of the dishes was amazing. The openness to questions and conversations made this a unique and comforting experience.",

I usually hate going out to steakhouses for dinner; I\u2019m somewhat snobby about preparation, particular cuts, quality, so I\u2019ve taken the time learning to do it right at home. Steakhouses, including all of your favorites in Chicago, are usually not worth the expense to me. El Che is worth it. El Che is more than worth it. For a fixed price, not including drinks, we were served a salad, empanadas, beef short ribs (which are meant to be chewy and fatty, by the way), fried cheese on toast with bone marrow, oysters, shrimp, broccoli, pork chops, ribeye, more bone marrow, more bread toasted with more marrow, sweet breads, blood sausage, chorizo, and three different desserts. It\u2019s 8:30am the next day, and I still can\u2019t get out of bed. Chef John messed me up real good. I honestly was in such awe of the presentation, that I don\u2019t recall many of the details, but one my favorites that I did catch was the oysters, which we baked with kettle chips and hot sauce. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, which is to say salted and over an open flame.  We had the opportunity to meet Chef John Manion, who spent a good deal of time talking to our table about chips and the importance of dips. He\u2019s clearly a man after my own heart, and I\u2019m very pleased we had the chance to eat at his table. I will 100%, without question, be returning for another meal.",

We ordered the \u201csoft pairing\u201d drink option to go along with the meal, which was also very good. Neither of us drink and are always happy when restaurants offer interesting drink options beyond booze. All of the staff was super friendly and made sure our experience was special.

We started with pimento cheese dip, and ordered the sirloin, short ribs (which are not your typical short ribs, just be warned ), asparagus side, sweet potato side dish, and an artichoke side. The sweet potato side dish I was a little worried about because it said it had caramel on top, and I was worried it would be too sweet. But it was delicious and very well balanced! The asparagus with Bearnaise sauce was also delicious! It had some fried shallots (I think?) on top and was really good. The sirloin was okay. The short ribs were mediocre. The waitress warned us that they were not what you are used to with short ribs. They were extremely fatty and had barely any meat on them. If you like fat, then these would be great for you. I had the dolce de leche ice cream for dessert and it was very good. So all in all the food was good. The service was another story. Our waitress was kind of standoffish and almost treated us as if we were idiots when asking questions about the menu. She was fine to have minimal interaction with, but I certainly wouldn't be rushing back here for the service. I'm not sure if that was a particularly bad day for her, or what, but we all kind of left their feeling put off, which is a bummer because we were very excited to try El Che out for the food. They do have valet. I did not see a lot of parking, so I'm not sure how promising parking yourself would be. Also, as a side note which I know really doesn't matter that much but overall affected our experience, the bathrooms were - I kid you not- 95 degrees. I legitimately was sweating after being in the bathroom for 2 minutes. I don't know if the heat was broken or what but it was unbearable.",

Now that thats out of the way...i was disappointed with El Che...Empanada barely warm in the middle like they slapped old refrigerated dry short rib in the middle...short ribs on the bone....chewy...i mean im sorry but in Philadelphia we go to the Italian Market and pick up premium cuts of beef...this meal should have been served with skirt steak...its just common sense...if you want to do short ribs...braise them...have them fall off the bone...dont give a chewy cut that I have to naw at in a crowded restaurant. Gnocchi...boring....It just didnt feel fresh...for the prices I expected little pillows with a deep rich pan fry. Nothing felt that premium...even the wine was Ok...for 80 bucks...in Philly...thats a 7 course dinner with foie gras and hanger steak and monk fish...but hey...i guess thats why I live in Philly. 3 stars for ambiance and friendliness.",

The reception was nice and attentive/friendly. The ambiance was okay - the chairs seemed cheap and where uncomfortable. They didn't even look hip, which was a surprise for the area. Light bulbs in the fixtures were mismatched and different color temperatures, which is a small detail, but something I noticed immediately, and set the ambiance to a cheap/builder-grade decor. Service was not good. Our waiter was attentive and accommodating upon arrival, getting drink orders and coming back to take our order. After that, we didn't see him until the end of the meal when he handed us our check, even when we were obviously looking for him. He never checked in on us so we didn't have anyone to report to when we had issues with our meal. We ordered the pork chops which were burnt to a crisp and had a pretty bad mustard sauce on it. The chimichurri was good, and the dried out/burnt pork chop needed a lot of it, and the peanuts that were on it looked like they were just thrown on. Bizarre for a $28 entr\u00e9e. The NY strip steak was cooked fine, but it was horribly under seasoned. For $58 it should be an great steak. But I did not care for it, and I'm a steak lover. The other small plates were unremarkable. The best thing I ate were the Brussel sprouts.  As I didn't want to make a scene with our dinner guests present, I kept my mouth shut and didn't complain about the poor service nor when I couldn't get a second drink order in. I flagged down one of the food runners, not realizing it wasn't our waiter. Eventually, another server came to our table, and I was able to order a drink, but it took nearly 20 minutes to receive. It was a pretty disappointing experience, especially considering it was a $260 tab for 4 diners. With as many amazing dining options as there are in the West Loop, I highly doubt I'll return to El Che Bar.",
