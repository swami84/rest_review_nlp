I tried to order a burger with fries and they put 3 different people on the phone saying they speak English when they didn\u2019t and the call last 15 minutes as I tried to give them my order they told me to speak Spanish. I recorded the whole conversation and it\u2019s the same thing on different occasions but don\u2019t speak English not even the delivery person as he couldn\u2019t even translate my order to the women. They slip their flyer under my door at least twice a month and can\u2019t even communicate in English. I am baffled as to how they can have a place of business when they only take orders from those who speak Spanish and then tell you call back on an hour maybe someone will be there that speaks English.",

The portions are large, it feels like A family restaurant, it's a small sized restaurant that has a lot of the good games on HD televisions. the staff is professional friendly but to the point. they mostly speak Spanish but can get your order. The food is well prepared and their food turnover is great. The service is exemplary but aside from the steamy glass which it's difficult to speak over the customer service is exemplary the prices are affordable even on a budget. This place is definitely worth a visit.",
