        "caption": "Made a last minute reservation on open table. They should not have reservations on open table because it is not a restaurant. This is a bar in a hotel that serves a few food items. We couldn't figure out how to get inside. Once inside there was no one to seat us or even a desk to check in for our reservation. Food was fine for a bar in a hotel. Staff was great but the place in general was disappointing because it is sold as a restaurant online and on open table. Prices are way too high for what it is.",

        "caption": "I was staying at the Hilton Chicago where this place is located. It was late, rainy outside, & I need something to eat. Thus I ended up here. The sliders & truffle fries on the menu caught my eye. Thank you for having your menu online. It was pretty empty & I found a server to inquire about placing a to go order. Since I knew what I wanted he took my order & gave me a class of water. Quick & easy. The bill was also brought out quickly before I even had food. A bit pricey for two sliders & truffle fries but that's what happens when one doesn't want to leave the hotel. My order came out pretty quickly & I took it to my room. The sliders were way smaller than any others I have had. For $6/each I expected them to be bigger than kids menu size. The truffle fries were tasty but way too much parmesan. It looked like the lid fall off the cheese shaker & no one cared to dust it off or make a new batch of fries. I shook off the excess myself. Hopefully I don't have to be subjected to this place again during my stay. Not worth the cost in my opinion.",
