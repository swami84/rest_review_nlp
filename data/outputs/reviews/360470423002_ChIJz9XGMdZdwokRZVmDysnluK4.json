I prefer Nene's without cheese, the flavors seem to come through more as I personally prefer a lively taco rather than a cheesy, comforting type. I also just feel better lol. At times, the tortillas fall apart a little too easily or get soggy, but in general it's good and I come back for it. You have to get it with the consome to dip or I think it can be a bit boring on it own. I think if they worked those things out they'd be just as busy as Landia.  I also tried the Birria truck by House of Yes and don't recommend that one. Otherwise I would also recommend Taqueria Al Pastor for non-Birria tacos on Wyckoff.  The new location is larger and they accept card now which makes it easier. I would love if online ordering would be made available next!",

We found that address, and it seemed like they were set up permanently in the new location (a different bodega/deli). Such nice guys. after we got our food and ate it in the park across the street, WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO GO GET MORE \ud83d\ude02 and ordered another round. It\u2019s THAT GOOD!!!",

The birria tacos were dry and nothing special- I didn\u2019t get any of the sauce with it to dip it in. I guess you have to order that and pay for it separately which I didn\u2019t know. The guy there was very nice but I just don\u2019t get the hype at all. I much prefer Taqueria Al Pastor on Wyckoff by Dekalb L stop. Wasn\u2019t expensive and in Tuesdays all tacos are $2. I wish them the best but for me it\u2019s nothing special.",
