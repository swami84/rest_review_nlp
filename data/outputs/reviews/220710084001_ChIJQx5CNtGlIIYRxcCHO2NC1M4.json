The atmosphere was delightful - historic charm with just enough modern taste. The coffee was some of the best I had in NOLA. Even seemingly simple dishes had a remarkable quality; for instance, the breakfast parfait was perfection. I usually don\u2019t order this sort of dish in a restaurant since it\u2019s easy to assemble at home, and prepared versions are usually too sweet. But this was better than any parfait I\u2019ve ever made! The granola tasted homey and intensely nutty, and was layered with thick unsweetened yogurt and fresh fruit. The balance between crunchy/creamy and tangy/sweet was ideal. The egg white frittata didn\u2019t sound especially exciting on paper, but it was amazingly flavorful while still being light. And again, the textural counterpoint offered by fresh greens and radishes made things interesting & balanced. The service was speedy and friendly, too. Overall, it was an easy-going and lip-smacking start to the day!",

        "caption": "(Translated by Google) The Silver Whistle is the bar of the Hotel Pontarchtrain, but it can be accessed without being a guest directly from the sidewalk or inside the hotel. The place is beautifully decorated, like an old diner, but with very good taste. The attention from the staff was impeccable and they prepared delicious and very good quality dishes. It is located on Saint Charles Avenue, in the Garden District of NOLA and is ideal for a lunch break or for breakfast.
