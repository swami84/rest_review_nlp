Incredible texture. I am not a crust person but this pizza converted me. Plus plenty of sauce and cheese, and the pizza is huge. Not your normal pizza. You must try it at least once.",

Perfect sauce to cheese ratio and that crispy buttery crust. 5 stars!  Super easy to preorder online and pick up. Def check out when you need an authentic Detroit pizza fix in DC!",

From what I can tell it's huge rectangular, deep dish pizza with a special dough that is crisp on the outside and chewy inside.  One cheese pizza is a pretty steep $24 but goes a long way. Each piece is fairly filling. The only issue I had is that it was really greasy.",
