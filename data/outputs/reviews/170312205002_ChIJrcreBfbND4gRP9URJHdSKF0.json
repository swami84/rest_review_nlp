Well let's just say if you were to leave one of their sandwiches, still wrapped, out on the kitchen table for 5-6 hours then ate it... you would be delighted to find a well balanced morsel that's delicious and filling. Not at all soggy! And it's even better fresh!  Best sandwiches in walking distance without a doubt!",

I've been following them for a while for something that had no basic deli meats like turkey, ham, bologna. So when the pastrami cheese steak popped up, I knew I had to go.  It was as good as I imagined it! Pastrami was smoky and tender with the cheese piled on, you can't go wrong! Bread is nice n chewy with a great toast. The sesame seeds add a nice flavor as well. I don't want to offend any philly folk so I'm not gonna compare it to the OG cheese steak, but highly recommend coming here for that. It's just so good with all the components together. Melty from the cheese with the perfect slight crunch from the toasted bread. Hope this one stays on the menu permanently!",

I ordered The Space Torpedo (a sandwich with turkey, pastrami, cheese, zesty pasta salad,  shredded letty, and tangy onions on a beautiful hoagie/sub roll), WHICH IS A BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT sando.  I had to share it with my father, and I wish I had bought two, because it was one of the most delicious sandwiches, and the zesty pasta salad ON the sandwich itself gives it a SOUL.  The dressing in that pasta salad and the zesty onions are so much better than any vinaigrette you've ever had.  And, the bread. OH THE BREAD.  I'm STILL dreaming of my second date with this beauty.  Also had the Sketty Egg Rolls, which were also surprising, especially to my Asian parents who thought they were Chinese restaurant egg rolls.  What an delicious twist on egg rolls, and sketty (spaghetti) with the banana peppers was so satisfying, and paired very well with each other.  IMHO skip the ranch -- eat it naturally, or not.  You do you.  Up next for me is the Collard Melt!  Oh, oh, oh, I ordered a few different cocktails:  Ecto Cooler, Tang-a-Rita, and the BK Manhattan.  My BIL LOVED the BK Manhattan, but, the Ecto Cooler was the big winner of the three.  I actually put the cocktail into a shaker and shook it with ice, then poured it into a coupe with a lime wheel (a little green on green...still needs some help on garnish), but, OH EM GEE.  I have a hard time describing it's flavor -- it's like a \"daiquiri gone wild\", and I can't wait until I can sit at the bar and have another (or I'll just buy a couple more to go and have them at home).  I firmly believe that we should be supporting small businesses, especially our restaurants -- as they go out of business, another light that makes this city shine bright goes out. Chefs Ryan and Mason are creative geniuses, and clearly are excellent chefs.  Let's keep them around!  Eat at Big Kids! Go....NOW!!",

At 3PM today, I was gifted a brown paper bag. Within this bag resided items from a Phr3$h little sandwich shop by the name of \u201cBig Kids\u201d. Big Kids. Large children. Gargantuan adolescents.  Hm.  Certainly I, like many people who still drink chocolate milk and own an Incredible Hulk Pinball machine, could relate to this simple yet charming idea of humans who, though progressing in age, refuse to abandon the carefree delight and bewilderment that are so often associated with the spoils of youth.  GRUBS:  Amy N Nettie. Nothing but NETtie here. Such cohesion. I truly cannot recall a time where I have had a sandwich that effortlessly embraced a savory sweet dynamic. So many sandwiches are satisfied with having the main players of beef and cheese put the team on their back, but each of the condiments, from the onion to burnt tomato, participated in such a way to align the chakras of flavor most excellently.  Vietnamese Crunchwrap: From the three bites I stole from my partner, I was thoroughly impressed. As a practicing carnivore, my venturing into the unchartered waters of veganism was absolutely pleasant.  Kid Frys: I cannot even begin to decipher what\u2019s going on here as the only way to sum this one up is \u201cdayummmmmmm son.\u201d Crispy, cheesy goodness with a lil\u2019 kick throughout. No dip needed. Bountiful flavor in some tasty spud strips.  DRANK:  Ecto Cooler: Direct throwback to the aftermath of getting pummeled in Little Leagues when Jimmy\u2019s mom would drag up the ol\u2019 Coleman filled to the brim with Juice Boxes. This one brings the fun flavor of the diamond days with an adult twist that is nothing short of brilliantly original and delicious.  Groni: Classic cocktail done right. Have a hunch that there might be a Chicago classic that snuck its way into this one. Very clear that the bartender absolutely knows what is up.  In conclusion: I dig this a lot. You will undoubtedly dig it too. Let\u2019s hope we see these righteous dudes and dudettes doing more than 4 days at a time soon because I could eat this 7 days a week.  Johnny Bravo.",

Every bite feels like a new experience as I notice different flavors that all just come together to perfection.  The pasta salad is on point. I usually give up on pasta salad after one or two mouthfuls, but I just couldn't stop eating it. Calling it \"good\" on their menu is a huge understatement.  Grabbed myself an Ecto Cooler (and they had other drinks for sale at the door) and whoever mixed the drink doesn't mess around. These suckers are STRONG and delicious. I can see myself getting into a lot of trouble drinking them.  And if the outstanding food wasn't enough, the entire staff are all stars. Girl working the door was so kind, cook who brought out my food was awesome, and the owner is one of the coolest and most genuine people I've ever met.  Go put your pre-order in now!
