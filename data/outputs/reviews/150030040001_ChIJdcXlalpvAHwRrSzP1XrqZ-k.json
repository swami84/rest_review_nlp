        "caption": "We were seeing Hot Tuna at the Hawaii Theater on July 25, 2019.  Wanting to eat first, we noticed a sign \"Medina\" across the street so we went to check it out.  Small place, probably only around 10 tables or so in the place.  We were greeted by a smiling young lady as soon as we entered and told to sit anywhere.  Menu was Morrocan food, lots of lamb dishes which hubby and I both love.  Food was excellent and plentiful.  Staff came to our table often to check on us and to make sure everything was to out liking.  Left there fully satisfied with a large doggy bag.  Leftovers tasted even better the next day",
