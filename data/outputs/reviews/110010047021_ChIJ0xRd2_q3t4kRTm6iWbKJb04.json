It's a family-friendly restaurant with stunning design that appeals to all crowds.  However, it's takeout only during the pandemic, but you get a glimpse when you go inside to safely pick up your food.  Where La Betty shines is with the sides. We ordered two sides that were outstanding- the caramelized cauliflower mash and the broccoli.  The main dishes weren't bad either. My chicken schnitzel sammie was pretty big with great flavor. My wife's Betty Burger was good, but nothing to write home about.  They have a generous list of beer, hard cider, wine and cocktails. For $6, you get a classy bottle of a ready-to-drink cocktail that is surprisingly mixed perfectly. The \"Fomo\" is a refreshing drink with a little kick.  Overall, La Betty was a good experience.",

I came here with a friend and we were both really excited to try the food since we both love A Baked Joint, La Betty's sister restaurant.  We started with the bread and the corn dogs. Both were excellent but the bread was slightly more appetizing. Bread is something these folks do VERY well. The corn dogs were also a hit and took me back to my childhood when I feel like I had corn dogs at least twice a week. Thanks mom.  I ordered the roast with cabbage for my entree and my friend got the schnitzel. The roast was cooked perfectly! I was actually a little surprised at how good it was. It wasn't dry at all and the cabbage was great alongside it. The schnitzel was also tasty.  We ended the meal with the flourless chocolate cake and that was also divine. Service was friendly and fast. Will be back!",

You feel at ease as soon as you walked in. I could easily see this as a date night spot, but would also definitely bring my parents here for a fun night when they comes to visit.  You can tell the drink menu is intentionally simple. It's been brought to the essentials, and all of the options are delicious. I had the red wine which was light but full of flavor. I also had a small glass of the darker beer, which was malty and soooo good.  To start we ordered the corn dogs. I love corn dogs in almost every case but these were especially good. For our entrees, we ordered the roast and the schnitzel, and both were truly spectacular. The roast was packed full of flavor - so tender and juicy. You could tell the schnitzel was incredibly fresh - the flavor was really delicate but well balanced.  The service was flawless, and the staff are friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  Overall, I couldn't have hoped for a better experience, and I will definitely be coming back.",

There are a variety of liquors available as shots(?), but apparently mixing these with anything is not possible.",

It can be hard to find a place to eat in this city that isn't aspiring to be the next Michelin starred spot with a Bon Appetit profile attached to it. The food and drink at La Betty are on par with those places, but the warm unassuming atmosphere makes you feel as comfortable as you are in your own living room.  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about both the food and drink. The beer service is inspired by the wonderful beer halls of Cologne, Germany, with 8 oz pours that seemingly refill themselves with the amazing table service.  I look forward to coming back many times!",

Soft lighting, wooden table, edgy and fun art\u2026 it made me so happy to walk into a place with such welcoming, kind, and helpful service staff, too.  On the fooooood, chicken schnitzel was my favorite! I could honestly have this every day. It's the right amount of crispy without being oily. I also got handcut fries as a side \ud83d\ude09 - it comes with a delicious green sauce which is kinda refreshing and creamy at the same time. One surprise for me was their deviled eggs \u2013 I usually don\u2019t even like deviled eggs, but this was really delicious! The right balance of creamy and nice egg white texture.  Oh, and the cheesecake. It's a must. Just do it. (I\u2019ve been craving cheesecake every day since I had it at la betty.)",

Chicken schnitzel holds its own with the best I've had in Europe, and the vegan galette pulls off the magic trick of crispy, flaky pastry with no butter. The French fries are some of the best you will find on the east coast. Great food, top notch service, excellent ambience.
