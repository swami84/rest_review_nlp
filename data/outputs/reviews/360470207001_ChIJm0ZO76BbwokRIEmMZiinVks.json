Rest assured, the Kimchi Grill was founded by the success of their popular food truck and made the ascension to brick and mortar in NYC, not an easy feat. Be warned, the aroma of fresh kimchi hits you in the face immediate as you step on premise. If you\u2019re a fan of fermented cabbage, you\u2019ll be even more excited for the meal that awaits. If not, don\u2019t be alarmed, delicious food is still in your forecast. The menu features an assortment of tacos, burritos and kimchi bowls. I decided to be adventurous and explore the relatively unexplored Mexican and Korean union, more specifically, the tacos. I ordered two of the BBQ beef short rib tacos dressed with red cabbage apple pear kimchi slaw (a mouthful, literally) and one seared pork taco with a sensational red paste sauce paired with fresh kimchi, the experience was electrifying. Both tacos combinations offered a mix of intense flavors, I experienced streams of herbal, limey citrus, and spice which were very satisfying as I savored each bite. All of the tacos are served on corn tortilla\u2019s which made fresh daily. Furthermore the tortillas are evenly toasted before enveloping the innards of your taco which adds a welcomed warm crunch. Not to be forgotten is the tender fatty meat that grace the tacos and tie the various components together supremely. Kimchi Grill has built a reputation with their tacos for intense flavors in addition to the blending of temperatures (the cool kimchi combined with the sizzle of the meat) to provide a memorable meal. This is a great option if you\u2019re looking for a quick yet adventurous bite in Brooklyn.",

I really like how they were toasted/grilled with a slight crunch. The sauce had a bit more soy sauce than the usual gogujang flavor. Sesame seeds was a nice touch. Approx 9 pieces.  Kimchi aranchini - 1 inch diameter rice balls with kimchi flavored rice (if there were kimchi pieces, they were not noticable). It was nice and warm. Kimchi flavor was just enough. Deep fried but not oily.  Kimchi fries - fries were good. The kimchi wasn't fermented enough and not spicy. The beans weren't necessary. Would've been bomb with more cheese.  Wings - Chipotle honey is spicy \ud83c\udf36 !! - Soy & garlic: always a fave. It was a 10 piece order but we got 9 pieces and something so small like a fried chicken foot \ud83d\ude11 (no meat)  Drinks - Mango soju cocktail: just the right combo of mango flavor and alcohol \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

She finally says something to me, but so quietly I have to ask her to repeat herself, which obviously annoys her. No biggie, I don't like rudeness, but I'm here for the food. I choose the tofu edamame falafel burrito and a side of spicy Korean rice gnocchi. Considering that I'm literally the only customer, the wait is rather long, close to 15 minutes. But, because I'm hungry, I figure anything will taste good. Wrong. The contents of the burrito were dry and unpleasantly burnt, to the point that I started dreading each bite, afraid of what I'd find. At one point I thought maybe they'd slipped some non-organic compound (plastic?) into the burrito--that's how bad it tasted. The gnocchi was worse--inedible. rock hard, overcooked, ultimately disgusting. All in all, an unpleasant experience.",

The Korean Arancini is fun take on the Italian one. We shared the krispy fish, spicy pork and tofu $10 deal. It was a good enough portion for a light lunch to share. I like the battered fish(not too greasy). The pork needed more spice. The Tofu was probably the best of the three.  While the name may say Kimchi. I found a lack of Kimchi in any of the dishes to my disappointment. I love Kimchi and missed it.",

I have to say that I was highly confused by the description of the street gnocchi but it is well worth the venture.
