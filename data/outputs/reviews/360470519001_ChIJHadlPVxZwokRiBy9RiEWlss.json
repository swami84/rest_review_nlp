From the minute we toured the Winery I knew it was the place we were going to get married. Emily and her amazing team made the process as easy as possible. The Winery itself is the perfect canvas for a romantic feel. The glow of the ceremony/dining room is what dreams are made of. The food was amazing and I loved that it was family style, everyone ate so much and loved our dinner. I loved that there was so much included in booking the space (candles, candle holders, day of event manager, food + dessert, the beautiful eclectic plates & silverware, alcohol). Because the Winery is so beautiful, if you want, you can cut back on flowers (which we didn't) and lighting (which we also didn't). But you could if you wanted to save a little extra and not get those things! The Brooklyn Winery completed the whole vision we had for our wedding. I wouldn't have changed a thing! I'll be forever grateful to Emily & the amazing team!",

The space looked beautiful and the food was delicious. We chose the Miso salmon, fried chicken, smashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables, all excellent. We used the suggested vendors for lighting sound and flowers, Mark and Gabrielle, who were excellent too. Our guests were raving about the Brooklyn Winery all night, and we were delighted.

Everything about our wedding was perfect and we felt like we didn\u2019t even need to make that many decisions because BW is so good at what they do.

As I said in my toast, you all were so integral in making our day so meaningful. From the planning process to being a friendly face when we stopped by for a bite to eat, everyone was so incredibly professional and the day ran so smoothly I cannot begin to express what a relief and pleasure it was to choose the Brooklyn Winery as our wedding venue. They were brilliant. It's clear they are family there, and Emily loves her job as the wedding planner. What started as a few boxes of decorations and vendor contracts turned into a magical space that was both completely \"us\" and also definitely the winery's eclectic vibe. We loved every part of the experience and will happily throw future events there (if you aren't booked up!). Oh. And we should probably talk about their dinner service as well - it was regarded as the best food people have had at a wedding, I take that as no small feat. And their wine is so very good. You've upped the wedding game to a new level BK Winery - thank you thank you thank you.",

Noel, the tour guide, was outstanding - the kind of person you want to be friends with, and my husband, who rarely comments on other women in front of me said \"that chick is awesome\".   A very fun afternoon jaunt followed by more wine and snacks.  The menu is much more streamlined than it used to be.  Loved my Old Vine Zinfandel on a cold day.

Somewhat seductive with the flicker of the candles illuminating each room, the rustic d\u00e9cor which was in good taste and most importantly the wine. Everyone left that night feeling really good such an amazing atmosphere. I received so many compliments which I took credit for but ever so grateful for The Brooklyn Winery Staff who played a good part in this event. They were so welcoming, the food very, very tasteful. Kara, Jessica and Sean were on top of everything and really helped out with suggestions, food choices and entertainment. This is a beautiful venue and I would recommend anyone to stop by for a glass of wine, a tour of the winery or host a party. And I will most certainly plan my simple Brooklyn Wedding in this beautiful Brooklyn Winery.",

The issue is I can't tell you the difference between styles of wine. Thankfully for us we had an amazing server who worked with both of us to select the right wines.

You know the saying, \"Small things big personality?\" well it applies to here [in a good way]. It was super easy to make a reservation for the tour and when we arrived 30 minutes early,  the hostess was very friendly. She gave us our tickets which we could redeem for a cheese or meat plate or a glass of wine. My friend got a glass of wine while we waited.  Before the tour took place, they took us up to a small room where they gave us each our own wine glass with the \"Brooklyn Winery\" engraved in it [you get to keep it]. We got to taste a bit of white wine while we waited for the tour to begin.  Although, since my friend already had a glass, she double fisting her wine of glass with samples.  Before the tour began, they allowed us to leave our stuff in a locked room where we would be visiting again to have more flights.  The tour itself was very short, there was only two rooms in which we walked through but the tastings they gave had a very generous pour.  The tour guide was very friendly and tried hard at being funny but I guess we were a tough crowd because no one really laughed. I believe we had roughly 12 tastings. I couldn't remember I got  completely wasted after the 2nd flight and kept giggling [I don't really drink at all]. My friend on the other managed to finish all of my tastings and hers and she ordered more wine during dinner. Overall,  the tour was very fun and informative and definitely worth the money if you are oenophile.  After the tour was finished, they did lead you downstairs where you could redeem your ticket or you can enjoy a causal dinner with drinks.  We got the cheese plate and it was a good size serving and buttermilk chicken bites, which was a bit smaller but just as delicious as the cheese plate. If you are going for drinks, I would definitely recommend the cheese plate. It was really good.  I would recommend signing up for their loyalty card because you earn points when you buy food, drinks and bottles of wine for free stuff.",

I like places that open the doors to future customers and give a sneak peak into the business. I have been a few time after the open and if I had the money, I would totally purchase a barrel to make my own wine. They also have a rooftop that I am planning to visit during the summer.
