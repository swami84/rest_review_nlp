First of all, I do understand that the outdoor dining experience is new and restaurants had to get things done quicky and try to maximize on space but the corner that we were jammed into was just ridiculous. I could barely pull my chair out to sit, and the table was small it's just wasn't adequate space for 8 people. The chairs were also very small and rather uncomfortable if you are a taller person. Some of the food was good, mainly the appetizers, I can't speak on everything or what everyone else got, but the chicken I ordered for my main seemed air fried and not properly, it was anything but good. Or fried and reheated , I don't know what but it wasn't proper fried chicken and I was very disappointed. Drinks are rather good, entertainment is good if you are in a spot where you can actually see. After having a not so great experience  I'm not sure I want to visit a second time .",

In this day and age, having a diverse menu is a must. Mushroom steaks, made with portabello mushroom caps would be awesome.   But they kept my party entertained and were super sweet.

We was told that we couldn't get the restaurant week deal due to the fact that it was early even though brunch was part of the deal. We order off the regular brunch menu. The empanadas was good, but my date's shrimp and grits was bland.  My food was ok.  We did enjoy the drinks from the bar and the music from the DJ... Maybe I'll be back....",

His skills and service definitely impressed us. We credit the establishment for offering fresh garnishments with their drinks. That's not something we're use to at other local bars in Harlem. I've rated Cecil 4 of 5 because I felt the service could have been a little better organized. The staff was a little overwhelmed with our family gathering in their private room. Other than that, I'd recommend to friends and family.",

Dinner started with soup or salad. I had a DELICIOUS SALAD which was followed by lemon ices to cleanse the palate before the entree. I wish I had not cleansed my palate because the entree of turkey, bread stuffing, veggies was strangely bland\u2014except for one section that was about two fork fulls of tasty turkey. The stuffing was mostly cubes of bread on a plate. It was as if they didn\u2019t roast enough turkey and sent someone to the grocery store deli for a processed turkey breast and a loaf of bread to fill up my plate. I left most of my meal uneaten. The positive-We had a cheerful waiter, the manager expressed interest in how our food was, and the music was good. So besides throwing away my money along with the the food, the place is very nice.  Oh hey dessert was also included but by this point I spent $200, was still hungry and just wanted to leave this restaurant.",

Unlimited mimosas included but made with little champagne and lots of juice making it too sweet to enjoy. Actual food quality is also just ok (like the commercial). All food bills have a 20% gratuity included that does not fit the service. Merely one attendant for several tables. Difficult to convey with server because of music, and one  manager who's responsible for it all. My advice is to have brunch elsewhere and go for drinks and music. Music is great, but again way too loud and lacks variety.",

Our waiter was very nice, but just to get bread at our table took over an hour. We were a group of 10 and we did not get our meal until.it was 2 hours in. I dont know why orders were getting mixed up, but the kitchen needs to get it together. For a nice establishment that it is, food can be better. Management was very flustered and I felt like we were being ignored after a while. If we did not get up multiple times to get somebodys attention I am pretty sure we would had never left, or even gotten our missing plates of food. They need to know how to handle busy weekends, when they have different menus available. On another note the music is nice, drinks are weak and be grateful if you get your food under 2 hours. Thanks but no thanks.",

The wait staff was professional and the drinks were good . I only gave it a 4 bc the chicken meal in the prefix menu tasted very much like a catering hall meal and they ran out of the lamb which is what I really wanted. Those that ordered the steak and shrimp highly enjoyed their meal. Overall good dining experience.",

I heard it was going to be two free complementary drinks for those who rsvp and that we was going to be able to sit down and enjoy the show. It turns out we didn\u2019t have the free drinks, no big deal I paid for my drinks. Then when the event started after 2 1/2 hours of waiting., I wasn\u2019t able to sit down. The capacity was 60 people and there was more then 100. If you are going to promote an event promote it right. If you gonna lie so people can come to your club well then I want my damn money back.  And that\u2019s what I got. Horrible experience and service. Will not be coming back!",

However for a restaurant at 6:30 in the evening the music was much too loud. Loud to the point that we left after our entree. We will be going back, however it will be Mon - Thur. We were told the music is at a background level then. It's a shame, because the best nights out with friends are Fri./Sat. If you don't mind talking loud to the person across from you, it is still a great restaurant.",

Just to have an idea we had a table for 8pm and they rushed us so bad that we were out from the restaurant a little before 9pm having had 3 courses for what they charged $150 + tax + tips per person. The starter were amazing but we could not enjoy it properly because half way thru our starter food runners put my fatty piece of Bone Prime Rib (that in the menu said it was 24oz but it was 12oz max if you included the roasted potatoes). From there onwards the whole experience  just went just down hill. The steak was just meh and fatty, besides it did not have any bone in... The mushrooms were so sour that I had to leave them in the plate. The roast potatoes were okay but who can manage to ruin roast potatoes? The desert very mediocre and they probably cut the strawberries with the same knife they cut the onions as they tasted like onions. The ambiance was nice and vibrant, waiter friendly but the food was disappointing; over all the whole experience was mediocre and didn't deserve our $200 a piece for less than one hour. I don't recommend visiting the place in festive days. I hope the restaurant's owner reads this review and considers a better service for the next festive celebration.",

I believe our reservations were at 6:30pm on a Wednesday. Most of us ordered the prixe-fix meal since it was restaurant week. Amazing deal! I realized tonight that this option was part of their regular menu. We received our second course almost two hours after we ordered(after 9pm), some Portions were cold. One of our friends received and ate her meal an hour before we received our meal. There was total of twenty diners in the entire restaurant at this time. So not sure why it took so long to receive our meal. We spoke to manager. She was accommodating, which brought me back to the Cecil, now with my husband. I ordered the porterhouse for one, comes with red potatoes. They were hard, manager gave me delicious mashed potatoes to make it up. My steak was delicious! My husband didn\u2019t care for his meal. He preferred the grilled chicken from the prize-fix menu. I believe it was caper sauce that he wasn\u2019t keen on. So, I shared my steak with him. Service was mediocre, prices are standard, and the artwork is amazing. I\u2019ve experienced it twice, will not be back a third.",

The meats were all over cooked and one person on our table got the wrong cut of meat. After a few back and forth, it turns out the kitchen made a mistake... But nothing was done about it. We ordered lava cakes for desert and received something different... Again, nothing was done to correct the situation. Our waiter was terribly embarrassed and apologized on behalf of the kitchen and management.

The owner also shed light on his plans to extend an outside caf\u00e9 area. I also appreciate rapport we had between the waitresses,  the Lady bartender, and those involved (Chefs) in making sure our dinner party was great. Everyone was so attentive In ensuring every member of the party felt special. While we heard precious Motown hits in the background, I enjoyed my Salmon layered with delicious sauce and my shrimp Enpanada gets an \u201coh yes!\u201d Family members raved over how I discovered such a lovely spot, and this coming from seasoned travelers.

We were also greeted by Rosa who was very welcoming.  It's only when we were all there and they sat us down is when I met our server Awilda. She is such an asset here. She is the epitome of customer centric service. She is friendly already and she knows the menu very well. She made both the suggestions for drinks and food. Both were on point. She is ready to please the customers of this establishment.  Even though she had several tables, she was consistently on top of her tables. She constantly checks in to make sure everything is going well.  The other guy is from Senegal, I think he said Antoni. Even while I was waiting at the bar area, he was engaging and friendly. He also was paying attention to the tables making sure things were cleared.  It was truly a nice experience and definitely thanks to Awilda for her dedication to the restaurant.",
