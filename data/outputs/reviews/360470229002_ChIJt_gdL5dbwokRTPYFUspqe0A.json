The chicken was excellent, the lamb was very tasty too, but a little dry on the inside. they took about half an hour to deliver to my place, good timing. I would definitely recommend the chicken tikka. An update- they have recently reduced their portions and sadly its only the lamb sheesh kebabs that are any good any longer.

It was a creamy lighter green instead of the typical dark, rich green with cheese chunks. The seasoning wasn't quite what I'm used to from this dish. It was blander and less healthful., felt heavy.  Not sure why it was creamy.  The Boti Kebab Masala \"special\" was disgusting.  No exaggeration.  It was sweet.  It also looked wrong, being a ketchep-y red.  I'm writing this review as my husband throws away the mostly full containers in the trash.  Samosas  and Naan were fine.  But I'd avoid this place unless they get a new chef.",

I am kicking myself now, because I have been missing out on some of the most authentic and delicious Indian food that I've ever eaten.  It was a good sign from the very beginning when everything on the menu looked like something I wanted to try.  My friend and I decided on the poori with chickpeas bengali style for appetizer and the classic chicken tikka masala and the beef karahi for entrees based on the recommendation of the friendly waiter.  The food came piping hot, aesthetically great looking, and turned out to be just as tasty as they appeared.  The garlic naan that complemented the meal was also an excellent highlight;a simple dish done right.  The main takeaway was how authentic everything tasted--the chefs really know their craft here.  I saw that Bombay grill offers take-out and deliveries, and that seemed to comprise the bulk of their business during the quiet meal we had there.  I highly recommend that you give this place a visit--the atmosphere was chill, friendly, and in my opinion, the food seemed to be best enjoyed straight out of the kitchen.  I definitely look forward to future visits to try out the rest of their menu.",
