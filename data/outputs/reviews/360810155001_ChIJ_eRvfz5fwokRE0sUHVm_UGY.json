And the DJ was pretty good, a little bit of everything and read the crowd.  We made reservations for a group of about 15 people for Sunday brunch but we're asked to wait at the door on arrival, so forget about trying to surprise your friend if that's your plan. We were greeted by a disgruntled bouncer who said the whole group had to be there before we could go in, then started shaking people down for $20 a minute later so we could \"skip the line\". Mind you, it's $40 cash inside already. We asked if he could at least put our cake in the fridge while we waited, which he took inside, but to our great disdain, found this cake next to the hostess where it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes while we were on line. Needless to say we were upset, since they knew the party had a cake when we made the reservation for which we were told we had to pay a $25 cutting fee. That's all well and good if the cake is even still standing, right?  After asking the hostess to put the cake away, a second bouncer seemed to be unaware that we were one group and kept yelling at everyone to pay up or step aside (at pretty close range) even though we informed her there was one person with all the cash who was handling it.  Once inside, they seated our group in 3 separate tables, so everyone was scattered and serving us the bottomless mimosas became a hassle. Speaking of mimosas, I was not served one until about an hour of being there and expressing my complaints to the host. There's a time limit for the bottomless, 2 hours I believe, and I was informed that there were only two hostesses for the entire club serving the mimosas. That is unacceptable. We had to constantly flag someone down to serve us, but nevermind that, you're basically paying for bottomless orange juice. We ended up buying 3 bottles, but that did not make service improve..  The food is served buffet style, and restocking was an issue. I had to remind staff twice that there were no plates, no eggs, no french toast and the man at the meat station was handing out slices of fat. If you're going to serve them two tiny slices, at least make sure there's meat on it!  Be prepared to pick up your own plates at the end of your meal, because no one ever came around to pick up the table or clean anything. We ended up gathering our own table and placing it in a nearby dirty dinnerware bin.  The place brought out the cake when asked, but never bothered to come back around to cut it after about 20 minutes of sitting there, so we ended up reboxing and just cutting it ourselves at home. hey, at least they didn't charge for the cutting fee.",

I'll start w/ the decor which was beautiful. There were chandeliers everywhere w/ purple & blue lighting. On the tables were votive candles. There were different dining locations. We were seated by the bar near the Dj booth in booth which made for intimate dining. I had a Peach Sensation and my husband had a Passion fruit mojito. He said his was tasty & as for me mine was just ok. I asked for a lime to add some tartness to balance out the over powering sweetness from the simple syrup. We then ordered a pitcher of the Passion fruit mojito and it was a good choice. For appiziter we ordered a sample platter which came with chicken/beef/pork empanadas, fried pork & fried chicken & calamari. We enjoyed it but there was a old oil smell to it, they just need to change the oil frequently. Next we had the Shrimp Mofongo, had good flavor but the plantains were not mashed enough. My husband had Salmon & mashed potatoes, it was delicious. Overall, drinks should be made well balanced, &replacing oil frequently makes for the best flavor to all fried goodies...",

My birthday took place in February, I\u2019m still upset.. here is a list as to why:  1. No matter. If you have Booked reservations- you must wait on the line. Which is disorganized. While waiting on line their I noticed their rating from dept of health during that time was a D. 2. They did not have my table ready stuck my party and I , in a table in the corner. By the kitchen and without enough seating space. 3.  \u201cUnlimited Mimosa\u201d LIES. They provide 1 full champagne flute upon you being seated. With nothing at the table. No water, no juice, no mimosas!!! You literally have to chase down the waitress. After running around to find her .. there was no sense of urgency AT ALL.. for her to gather all 10 of us drinks. They are completely unorganized. 4. I spoke with the manager- Still nothing. He sent over a 1 drink for my troubles. 5. The service is terrible. I mean this is the biggest place where ever you go. This plays a big piece on how the evening plays out.  I am truly embarrassed that. I invited my friends and family out for an event and have it turn out this way.  I reached out afterward- I never received a call back. Worst experience EVER!!!!",

She was trying to get us out of the club and fabricated multiple stories to try and get us to the point of exit. She insisted we had to move from the spot she placed us, tried to get us to buy two additional bottles after already purchasing four, and kept checking up on our bottles to see when we would finish. We were KICKED OUT BEFORE 2am and I blame that terrible bottle girl. You don't hire GIRLS to do a women's job which in a business like this, professionalism and customer satisfaction is key !

When I say brunch party, I mean PARTY like a Saturday night in the club. I will break down this review. Make sure you make a reservation beforehand.  FOOD - It is buffet style, unlimited food, and I recommend you go to the buffet twice. The food options at 1:00pm is a little different than what they have at 3:00pm. Keep in mind the buffet is from 1:00pm-4:00pm. The price also includes unlimited mimosas, and trust the waitresses keep the mimosas flowing. Mimosas are only served until 3:00pm, so take advantage of them.  MUSIC - Live DJ spinning all the hits, in both rooms.  DRESS CODE - Dress to impress, jeans are totally fine. If you wear heels, bring flats so that you can keep the party going. Men jeans and sneakers are ok, just look nice.  AMBIANCE - There are go-go dancers that perform on two mini stages, there are cool mascots that go around, and last time there was a person playing drums. Also, they play soca and do a follow the leader dance (keep your napkin for this part because it is so much fun).  Great place for any type of event and can accommodate large parties as well. They also have a great party on Saturday nights as well and the place is usually packed.",

ONE HOUR after we asked for it.... and this is what I think happened based on what the cake looked like.... they dropped the cake... so the bottles were layed flat on top of the cake where the damaged was \u201cattempted\u201d to get covered.... and \u201caged to perfection\u201d is missing some letters so you really don\u2019t know what is written on the trade....then they implied I brought the cake like that... the candels were MIA... they said the candles were broken.... so how about you bring one of those flashy sparkly things that light up the room when you bring bottles???? Or maybe one of your stupid candles???? No that did not happend.... so he DID NOT BLOW candles on his birthday party...some manager came to see what can he do about the cake? Well can you replicate the same cake again... right now when everyone is ready to sign happy birthday? Offcourse not! ..... bottle service??? Took about another hr to happend.... some of her guest left at this point...can you imagine my sister\u2019s embarrassment? .... then we get the bill and they are saying how they didn\u2019t charge my sister for x amount of drinks to compensate the salad.... but the bottle service was charged as 1200 instead of 850... there you go you get something complimented in the house.. toma! 400 bucks latta. So thank god they drank the buzz n made the best of it after all... n I\u2019m sure the place will get packed again next weekend... in my opinion if you are looking to just hang out n have a drink this place will do... but they do not have the experience to service a big party... n they charge A LOT for the type of services they offer. Also you may like the fact that you can rock your t-shirt and jordans... they don\u2019t seemed to have a dress code!",

It was only the last 20 minutes of dancehall/reggae. Anyways, avoid working with a promoter called WILLIE. He promoted me a $695 package, said it was okay if I got there by 1AM. The owner forced the waiter to make me pay $1,072. I spoke to Willie at the club as to why I'm being charged so much more. He said he will handle it. He left!! As he was leaving he was avoiding eye contact and I still asked if it was okay, being that he said he was going to speak to the owner. I have the text messages still. I ended up paying so much more money, I wasn't able to leave as much gratuity for the waiter, which was amazing. I can't remember his name. But, he was so amazing and really made our experience great for my boyfriend's 29th birthday. JUST AVOID WILLIE. Promoting and not following through makes it bad for the business and it sucks that it's all because of that one person I will not returning. Thank you to the staff of Spyce who still did their best to make our first experience a great one.",

But we already knew that for we had come to Cavo on numerous saturday nights to just spend time dancing and have a few drinks. This visit was a week day and we were ready to eat. My wife after a long day with the books and I after a days work.  The meal began with bread and butter. We ordered fried zucchini and watermelon salad as an appetizer; 2 of the only 3 things which were on the Living Social menu. Both of us really enjoyed it. It wasn't until the entrees came out that I saw a frown on my wife's face. The Branzini she ordered, as per her words, tasted weird. When I tried it, I found it to be tasteless. My skirt steak, although was juicy, was extremely over salted.  The desserts were really good. We had crepes and baklava. But still, before we left, the wife grabbed my arm looked me in the eyes very seriously and said, \"can I ask you for a favor? Lets never come here again.\"  My lady has spoken. We will be searching for better Greek cuisine for another random Tuesday night.",

What type of sexist thing is that? Both females and males at the event paid the same price to get into this establishment. I felt as though it was very inappropriate and unprofessional.

The ambience was really nice and the seating arrangement was very spacious. However the food was quite bland and the portions were dietary. We started off with 11 dollar glasses of sangria which was more like koolaid with a few apples in it. Extremely small amount of alchohol in it.......we had the cevice for an app which had very little fish but a lot of the other stuff like the peppers and onions..She had the mussels dish which was more shell and less meat...heck some shells didn't even have the meat in them.....ok so the waiter made this big to do about the blackend bass special....not only was it very bland , it came with nothing. No veggies or potatoes or anything...it was totally lacking ,  the waiter's only concern seemed to be pushing more of those overpriced \"virgin\" sangrias.. We spent before tip 80 bucks for what in all honesty shouldve been about 35 dollars worth of food and liq. Life goes on ,  people come here for the club and lounge scene late night....as for dinner , go somewhere else first",

The hostess and staff is very attentive and friendly, always smiling.  Pretty good selection of wine and pretty decent cocktails, but lacking in the Scotch and Beer department.  The Food was excellent: taste great, good presentation and good portion.  We had:  MUSSELS (Tommy's favorite): Recommended OCTOPUS: Recommended CHILEAN SEA BASS (Dino's favorite): very good LAMB CHOPS: Excellent Their signature dish (a picture on the dinner menu on their website, third picture down): these huge shrimps with fried stuff wrapped around it: Excellent.

They claim to serve a Greek fusion-style cuisine, but I wouldn't call it Greek at all, with the exception of the fish selections on the menu. Secondly, it's not much of a restaurant it's more of a bar/nightclub. When it turns into a nightclub around 10pm, expect to see a lot of Euro-trash: gold chains, chest hair, gaudi clothing and bad tans.  I'm from Los Angeles and this is the kind of place you'd expect to see in Glendale or Woodland Hills, so if you're familiar with those areas, you'll know what I'm describing.  Cavo is also a nuissance to the neighborhood and the neighbors are annoyed by the loud music that is constantly on till 4AM.",

We started with our ceromony in the garden, reception followed.  How awesome it was to have a cocktail outside during a ceromony!   Then the reception indoors where the entire main floor was our dance floor with the band and DJ  set up in front of the huge windows....It was also the perfect 80 degree day with a light breeze, sun shining through into the main floor made for the perfect lighting.   As far as decor this place is just incredible!!   Always keeping it fresh,  changing only the slightest of things that just make the right impact!    All of our guests could not believe how outstanding the food(eric miller, awesome), the service and the ambiance could be found in the heart of Astoria.....Cavo was our first date and we were so happy they could accomodate us for our occasion...Oh Yes,  Anna, the event coordinator,  knows the space so well and without her it probably would not have gone so smooth.....I recommend them to everyone for  any future event!!!
