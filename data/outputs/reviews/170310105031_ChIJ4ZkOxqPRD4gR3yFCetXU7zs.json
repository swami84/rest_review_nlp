I contacted Grubhub to help and they were useless, so I reached out to the store directly as it was only 10 mins before they closed. The staff member who answered was apologetic and had my order remade and redelivered meaning the staff stayed at least 30 mins late to correct the mistake. I am appreciative of their commitment to their customers. Thanks!  Plus the food was delicious.",

The only positive thing about this new Thai place is the price... you can get a lot for your money. That, unfortunately, is where it ends. The food was simply not good. I ordered Pad Thai that lacked flavor, pot stickers that were dry and tasted like carrot puree, Pho that my husband literally couldn't finish, and crab rangoons that were essentially crispy wontons. Could they have been having an off day? Maybe. But I won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone...
