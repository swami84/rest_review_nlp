We had a small feast for 3 people that included the burrata (although I wish it was on some greens vs. farro) spinach and artichoke dip, fried chicken and dirty fries and that was just the start! We also had the eggs Benedict, the breakfast croissant and the grilled cheese modified to Loris' recommendation. Everything was tasty and made with love! They were also super dog friendly and made it a pleasant experience even for our fur friend. Overall, a great place for Sunday brunch!",

This is definitely more of your bottomless brunch place versus actually getting good brunch food.  I judge a place based on if you're getting what you paid for and I would say that's where the restaurant missed the mark. It's a place that is trying to be classy by charging high prices but cutting corners with ugly tablecloth (reveal the beautiful wood tables underneath!!), cheap hand soap and of course average food.  The Brunch Burger was simply two flavorless beef patties with \"truffled\" brie (almost no truffle in there)  and shoe string fries.  The Eggs Benedict had extremely runny eggs and also average at best.  Left with a bill north of $50 for two average entrees, a Nespresso coffee and tip, we quickly made the decision that this would be on our \"'not likely to return\" list.",

Loris and his team beautifully executed a four course tasting menu and wine pairing and seamlessly served all 26 guests in a timely manner. No easy task serving this number of people at one time. From the charcuterie boards to the salmon and ratatouille to the steak frites and macarons for dessert we were in sensorial overload. Each dish delicious and even more enhanced by the wines Loris and I choice to pair.  I have dined here several times prior to this and have always had a wonderful wine and dine experience. Will certainly make this a staple and I know my guests will be returning as well. Thank you Loris and the team at Coco Bistro for making this event a most memorable one. Cheers and see you soon!",

When a tall and charming restaurant staff invited us to wait at the bar and brought us a wine list, we were like, \u201csure.\u201d We ordered a wine, as two other girls walked in the restaurant. They were standing by the door. You may have guessed it by now, yeah, the two girls got the table we saw before walking in, though they came after us. As I was waving at the restaurant staff for a answer, he was too busy to even notice.  Why this happened was a curious case. Was it because we ordered the drinks, but the girls didn\u2019t? Was it because the girls were young blonde girls? Was it because they were two girls? ... No one will ever know the reason. But if a restaurant is run by picking and choosing their customers based on their staff\u2019s preference, it clearly has business immorality. So sad.",

I go in with my wife for a pre cocktail before a show at the Pier. We sit at the couch section where there is an ottoman. The waitress comes over to greet us and I don't even realize my feet are up on the ottoman, so I quickly remove them, fixing my error. The server laughed and told me I WAS allowed to have my feet up, people did it all the time, and please make myself comfortable. I was grateful for this gesture, as was my wife and thanked her for letting us know. Flash forward five minutes later, Mr pretentious blazer wearing manager, comes right over to us with his hands clenched together in a \"prayer\" like stance and a face like I had just put my hands all over his freshly painted walls, and says, \"please remove your feet from our furniture.\" I quickly do so, as that was his request, and said, \"oh I'm sorry, the waitress said...\" and before I can finish, he says, \"we don't come to YOUR house, and put OUR feet on YOUR furniture.\" Really? REALLY?! My jaw dropped, as did my wife's. So now, I have just been scolded like a parent to a 5 year old who tried to eat a cookie before dinner, and feel like a complete idiot, so once again, I apologize and as I try to explain again that I thought I had permission,  he completly walks away in my mid sentence,  as if \"I'm done with you\" and that was that. This is a good part to acknowledge there were about 9 people in the entire place at this time, and some were staff. It was just a real uncomfortable, unfortunate moment that took the wind right out of our evening. The original server came by and said she was sorry for the confusion and that people put their feet up ALL THE TIME,  but the damage was done. To add insult to injury, another group of people came in about 10 minutes later, and it was all warm greetings, hugs and kisses from mr warmth himself, owner/manager. Regulars, I guess. Which is HOW you want to be treated. My wife and I clearly did not make that list. So there you have it, folks. Not cool. Will not be returning. And I will be telling all friends and family as well to avoid like the plague. I'm thinking some readers of this review will roll their eyes and say I am making a big deal, which is your right. But you weren't there, folks. It was humiliating, unnecessary and I wouldn't wish it on anyone looking to have a nice time at a new place. Even if he  had came back, just once,to check on us or converse with us, just to show there were no hard feelings. Nope. Couldn't be bothered. He said what HE needed to say, and ignored us for the duration of our stay. (Which was about 50 minutes....my wife doesn't drink quickly). His ottoman, was more important then the feelings of my wife and me.",

In any case, we were fine that there was no hostess, so I decided to go to the bar to ask for a table for lunch. I told the bartender that I wanted a drink while I wait for a table ( mind you the restaurant was empty ). The manger approached my guest and I, and told us in order to stay at the bar we must order a drink, which we did, and advised him that we are waiting for a table. He continued to ignore what we said and told us that there was no table for lunch. Meanwhile, a group of tourists walked in grabbed a table themselves and were given menus right away.  I walked out and knowing that I live in the neighbor, I will NEVER go back. I'll be sharing this with all of my neighbors along with any friends that visit to NEVER COME HERE! The food seemed okay to begin with but we wanted to support our local business. Honestly, there are so many better places to dine in the area.",

Portion is on the small side so order more than one dish per person.  The Nutella cake was delicious and unique.  Duck confit is deboned duck crusted and pan fried.  It\u2019s quite delicious.  Limited selection on glass of wine, more by bottle. Pasta was good but need higher ratio of meat to pasta.  Overall not a bad place to hit if you are in the area but probably not worth marking a special trip to try.",
