They worked so hard to deliver our order, after we accidentally chose 'pickup' on their site, and they still got it to us within the hour! Great-tasting and high quality keto foods. The grilled cheese and tomato soup (my fave) was such a \"treat\" after 3 years on Keto! The chicken nuggets were made of high quality white meat, and the portion is very filling. Love the queso. My partner loved the cheese and egg tacos! He said it's exactly what he's tried to make himself - high praise from him!  Quick update: Mo and Dani worked so hard with us to make these amazing mini cheesecakes (just added to photos) that we special ordered for a tiny family wedding. They thought of everything and personally delivered our order!! Amazing couple and wonderful cheesecakes!",

I tried the lasagne and the broccoli parm bake.  Both dishes were very tasty and satisfying,  I discovered low carb, vegetable focused (but I do eat red meat, poultry and fish as well) eating when I retired in 2016.  I lost 45 lbs. and never suffered from hunger pangs.  All of my test results at my annual physicals have been so much better and I haven't taken a prescription drug since I started following this course of eating.  The KETO Kitchen is unique in this area.  I no longer have to study a dish on the menu and figure out how the kitchen can modify it to keep the carb level low.  So, now we have a restaurant that serves delicious food that is low carb and provides an inviting and friendly atmosphere.  Kudos, Mo, for getting it right!",

Both of them were so kind and even gave me an in-depth explanation of why they choose the ingredients they did, and their promise to quality.
