I like their non traditional interpretation on afternoon tea and that there was a nice balance between savory & sweet bites. More often than not afternoon teas tend to lean more towards sweet bites. I think because it was holiday special it was $65/pp included nicer items such as oysters, beef tartare, roe and (verse simple stuff like cucumber sandwiches and mini quiches etc.) and included a glass of Prosecco. The cost was pricey and I wish it include a few more bites (there was 12 total, with no repeats) but I'd say cost to value it's on par (if not a little higher) with other DC hotels Afternoon Tea service that includes a glass of alcohol.  Bites included (from memory): - Two oysters - Beef tartare with salmon roe (my favorite) - Asian pear Camembert cheese and honey - Smoked salmon with whipped herbed cheese - pappadam crisp (my favorite) - a smoke fish salad on crisp - mini chocolate caramel tarte - olive oil & something cake -sugar coated grapes - cheese filled date with honey (not pictured) - French macron - coco flan type dessert. This was out of place being usually large and dense (I took it to go).",

I showed up at my reservation time, and the staff said that they were shut down for in-person dining, both indoor and outdoor. They did not notify me in advance that my reservation was canceled even though my reservation was confirmed in Resy. The restaurant did not take any responsibility for this problem and was more defensive than anything. If you want to patronize a restaurant that is a true business, pick a place like Tiger Fork instead of this place. We made a reservation at Tiger Fork once, and they had to cancel our reservation due to inclement weather, but they called us to let us know and to reschedule. That is what a real restaurant does: respects their customers. Please go somewhere else, not here.",

They seem to be all over the place; insisted \u2014 despite telling us  otherwise over the phone \u2014 that we couldn\u2019t cut our own birthday cake, and had to pay $5 per slice (!!) for them to do so. Not a huge deal but kind of a scam to say they\u2019d only charge us if we wanted them to cut it for us, then actively block us from doing what they had said we could do. $30 for cutting a $90 cake is really dodgy. Wouldn\u2019t go back despite a cool location and nice vibe.",

Erik Bruner-Yang\u2019s all-day menu seems to check all the current boxes, from \u201ctoast\u201d to tuna, as in crudo jolted with ginger in a splash of coconut milk. Asian touches abound; yuzu aioli is a better dunk than ketchup for fries. But the main reason to drop by is Pichet Ong. The former architect is the pastry chef, and I\u2019ve never had anything less than dreamy from him. Ong draws inspiration from Chinese pantry staples \u2014 ginger, tea, rice \u2014 and favorite childhood sweets. He says he was thinking of Maltesers candies when he created his \u201cBrooklyn\u201d cake: a dome shaped with devil\u2019s food swollen with espresso, banana pudding, salted caramel and vanilla cream. His desserts, including a matcha cake with berry mousse, are blessedly restrained in their sweetness. Ice creams are presented on chewy rice flour wafers: Go for pistachio, veined with crushed candied nuts. You may wait (and wait) to be seated and wait (and wait) for a drink to find its way to you. But you\u2019ll never be disappointed to order \u201cjust dessert, please.\u201d",

I did notice that the first bar (where we were ignored) was lacking supplies, as the bartenders would periodically come across the room to gather wares.

I started with sencha which was weak. Don't get me wrong because I love a good high quality grassy sencha but this was not that. I then asked to switch to oolong. It started ok if a bit weak after ~5 minutes of steeping but before long it was bitter, blech. Higher quality tea and a better serving method would be nice.  A note on acoustics: We sat in the corner next to the hotel check-in booth. We could clearly hear a training going on up on the third level at the front opposite us. Entertaining for sure and a bit distracting if not annoying. We did pick up a bit of info on red wine.",

Every dish was fine or okay, nothing was excellent. Our server was friendly and gave good cocktail recommendations, but when we ordered a pasta dish, she told us she doesn't recommend we order it. I appreciated knowing that, but I don't think any restaurant at this price point should have items on the menu that staff can't recommend in good faith. We ordered fries with nori, but couldn't taste the nori at all. They were just regular old salted fries with some nori that just looked like parsley flakes on top. Our knife cut noodle dish was incredibly bland and underwhelming. The avocado and hearts of palm salad was fine, but again nothing special or memorable.",

It is beautiful and full of life.  The service was friendly and competent. We ordered a bottle of French rose, which really hit the spot with dinner. The duck consomme was spicy, delicious and just what a cold winter night calls for. The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and accessorized with caramelized and fried onions which and a sauce which took them to another level. The burger was quite good but the fries were a masterpiece. Finally, they provided us a piece of amazing Earl Grey cake on the house which was a very pleasant surprise. We highly recommend.",

The dining hall may be my favorite part of the restaurant. Stained glass windows - reminiscent of the structure's origins as a church - casts a warm shade with a romantic atmosphere. The seating options are diverse - with horseshoe couches, communal and private tables. The menu options change quite often, but they're all good. Chef Pichet Ong's cakes make a fabulous dessert selection.",

Definitely a great place for post-dinner drinks & dessert or an afternoon snack. The food has significantly improved from the first time I went in March, so definitely try it out again if you found the food was abysmal the first time you went earlier in the year because it's a different experience/menu now. There are still some \"just ok\" items (as there would be at any restaurant), so I would take recommendations from servers or from people you know when deciding from the menu.",

However, the first spot was undeniably Brothers and Sisters. I was drawn by the concept and its visionary creator, Erik Bruner-Yang who runs Maketto. Not to mention, the genius behind the drinks of Brothers and Sisters is Todd Thrasher, who is my favorite mixologist in the area (known for PX, Restaurant Eve, and the soon-to-be-open Potomac Distilling Company at the Wharf).  The lobby of the hotel, flanked by twin bars on either side, is actually the dining room of Brothers and Sisters. If you sit in the open lounge, you can look upward to a fancy, spiky chandelier fashioned from church organ pipes, paying homage to the hotel's former life as a historic church. We sat at one of the bars and ordered some drinks to start.  I opted for \"I Used to be Named Sherlock Holmes but I have Matured,\" which is Suntory Toki whisky, lapsung souchang syrup, lemon peel, and lemon oil. My other half chose the \"It's You and Me and We are Back Again.\" This one is Belle Mead whiskey with umeshu and topped with satsuma soda. Both cocktails were phenomenal, very Todd Thrasher-like. If you don't like the sound of these contemporary drinks, they do offer classic cocktails too. However, I would recommend any of the quirky, unique cocktails that they've whipped up.  Food-wise, we ordered the uni tray service, knife cut noodles, and the beef short rib burger. The uni tray - though expensive - is delicious. And playful! Here, the uni is served upon some ice and comes with an assortment of toppings like chives, cheese, onions, salt, etc. The knife cut noodles were also fantastic. The chewiness of the noodles paired well with the crunchiness of the fennel sausages and greens (gai lan and asparagus). And of course, the beef short rib burger. Simple, straightforward, lovely. Loved that it was topped with toasted Hawaiian rolls instead of the traditional bun. Also, the side of fries that comes with the burger are sprinkled with nori (insert mind blown gif).  The menu is true Erik Bruner-Yang - eclectic flavors that work collaboratively and fuse multiple cultures together in one. I love it. I recommend it to all.",

The menu feels a bit hard to approach but every item held up well.  Where they really felt down is service.   water not refilled, plates left all over the table, drinks for my daughter not refilled without us asking.  Then check brought without asking about coffee or another beverage.  A customer shouldn\u2019t feel a lack of hospitality, rushed out or unwelcome and while the drinks and the food stand well, the setting is right up our alley and the drinks were challenging and delivered, peole remember how you make them feel and we felt that we weren\u2019t taken care of.   There is too much good food available to waste a dining experience somewhere that forgets we are in the hospitality business.",

The manager came over with the potato pancake which was again way too salty for me. We got the bill which included the entire breakfast. At this point, the tip was getting smaller and smaller. The manager came over after the bill was run through to give me a discount but was also trying to explain why the 2nd pancake was no better than the first. No apologies and the service was poor. I did get a discount off of breakfast after the mgr came by - however the server should have conversed with the mgr prior to giving me the bill for the entire amount. Won't be going there again.",

Bar is virtually empty at 4:25 - where the hell are all the shady DC residents skipping out on work early? Y\u2019all letting me down.  Dealer\u2019s choice: (\"Ivy Started It\") Lemongrass. Yuzu- Japanese citrus fruit. Vodka. Mizu shochu - Apparently most popular distilled spirit in the world (only cuz its China\u2019s favorite).  Dinner: MaitreeD was friendly and accommodating and I got a sweet seat where I can see all the customers walking in. The voyeur in me is squealing! Duck consomm\u00e9 was delicious. Avocado salad was uniquely presented and had novel spices and was refreshing. Tuna crudo had a kick but was very tasty! Chicharrones- airy , spicy with French onion dip. Yum. Octopus hot dog was ok but chewy. Potato Rosti- hash browns meets spices - great! Cheesecake was amazing!",
