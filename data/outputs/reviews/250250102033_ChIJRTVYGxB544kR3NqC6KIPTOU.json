I Ordered late at night so I understand that it might not be as fresh as food ordered during regular hours which is understandable. However, I found 2 hairs in my mouth while I was eating and that made me feel quite uneasy, especially during this current COVID-19 pandemic. In general, finding hairs in the food your eating can pose a risk to your personal health and safety, but even more so for the fact that we are currently in a pandemic. I know the hairs weren\u2019t mine as I had started eating right as I opened the lid and I have also recently dyed my hair to a lighter color than the hairs I had found, so I know for certain these hairs were not mine. I normally don\u2019t write reviews like this and I really want to support local businesses during these tough times. But, I felt a strong urge to write this honest review to inform others. I\u2019d want other potential customers to be able to make the most informed decision when choosing where to eat.",
