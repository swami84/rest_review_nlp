So I tried again yesterday on a Saturday, mind you their hours are 12PM-10PM, I walked to the store and arrived at 9:28pm just to be told that they are closed.

They seem to lack organization and people in the back don\u2019t wear masks and speak over the food which i don\u2019t like but the food was okay I guess. The wait was not with the food though. FOOD: The mac and cheese had a lot of flavor and a tad bit too much cheese but that\u2019s just my opinion. Everyone likes mac & cheese differently. The wings were soooooo good. I had sweet chili on the side, in my opinion it tastes better with the sauce on it but I only received 1 very small cup of sweet chili. The portions are really big, the chicken wings themselves were on the larger side which is a bit suspicious but I\u2019ll say less. The fries were like regular frozen fries out of the package but they hit the next day when you reheat it, idk why. CUSTOMER SERVICE: The more mature lady at the front had the most welcoming and kind presence towards me and thanked me for my patience which I appreciated because I was lowkey catching an attitude for having to wait for so long. The other two younger ladies weren\u2019t very welcoming. They remind me of teenage girls in highschool that the teacher pairs you with but they don\u2019t really want to work with you but they just do it and get it over with. Overall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend but I would try it again. Try it for yourself to see how you feel about it.",
