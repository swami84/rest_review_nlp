Look at a few places and took a closer look at this place and called. Spoke to Victor who very friendly on the phone. He convinced us of the 3 varieties of oysters he had to serve. We decided to take a chance and try this place. When we got there, we almost passed it since it was dim inside and outside. The is barely a sign, but good places are like that. Victor opened the door for us and I identified myself, he was very welcoming!! We sat down and he already knew from our phone. He had 3 types of oysters; Kumamoto, Irish Point and Hood Canal. All 3 were good, our #1 preference was Irish Point. They were delicious. Victor had us get about 3 dozen of the oysters because they were so good.  The proseco he served us was crisp and dry and delicious.  Everything was going smoothly.  Then another patron told us about the crab toast,  and again it hit the point.  Victor took really good care of us all night.  Oysters are not cheap,  but that night I did not care because everything was going well that night. This place is truly a gem, fresh food, great host and friendly patrons. These are a great combination to have a great dining experience! Make sure Victor is there to really enjoy your time!",
