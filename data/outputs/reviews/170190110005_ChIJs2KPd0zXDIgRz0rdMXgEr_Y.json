After finally checking on our table and removing our plates, he took an additional 10 minutes to hand us the check. He verbally said my order correct but the price looked off to me. I had to click \"back\" on the device 2-3 times to see the receipt details since he took an additional 5-10 minutes to check if we paid the check only to find out that we were charged two pizzas and a wine bottle. Yes, we were charged $60 out of a $40 order. The waiter went on to say he \"mixed tables\", mind you only 3 other occupied tables existed, only one which had alcohol, yet they ordered glasses not a bottle and additionally had a different type of alcohol.  - Never checked up on my table. - Definitely prolonged the check. - Verbally stated my order but acted surprised when I showed him what was charged - Made a unreal \"mistake\" since visually, no other table ordered an identical bottle - Made two comments: When ordered the bottle: \"getting drunk!\" After finishing the bottle: Acted surprised  Was the waiter trying to purposely overcharge? Wanted a bigger tip? Thought we were drunk enough to just pay and go? That's what I think. I've had many drinks, a half bottle of wine won't be enough to fool me.",

It doesn't, however, jibe with the open cafe style seating and junk wait service. Our server couldn't keep her hands out of her mouth. We had to prompt her for the check, for boxes, for other things. The other server dropped things not once, but twice, at our table. When we asked for the check (I was going to pay in cash), we got a hefty bill presented to us on an iPad ($70 for a salad, three small but good pizzas, and a can of pop like you'd get at a diner), and that bill gave us the following options for our tip: 18% for basic service, 20% for decent service, 25% for good service, 30% for great service (or something very similar to what I just wrote). I'm sorry, but that type of pretentiousness is enough to keep me from coming back. I've worked in kitchens for over 10 years, and there is a lot about Pizzeria Antica that turned me off. I want to give innovative places good ratings, but come on. Offer good service, make the experience more intimate or fun (to match your price tag), lose the red paper napkins, and let customers choose how they want to tip.",

Waitress had us taste the wine since we couln't decice, I think the wine was too sour (maybe open for too long?) so we did not order any. Pizza was very authentic italian and fresh, quality ingredients for sure. Sadly the crust was burned but the inner part was very very good. If you want authentic italian pizza the place is good, but if you like american style or want it cheaper, go somewhere else. Service was okay although not excellent.",

First off, we sat at our table for 20 minutes, with the restaurant 3/4 full at best, waiting for someone to even acknowledge us.    We placed our orders and the food took awhile, but the pizzas were very good.  However, I requested parmesan cheese and it never came.  In fact the server never even checked in with us once to see how we were doing.   After dinner my children wanted some gelato and again, no server ever came to our table to assist.   Finally, at the checkout counter, the host person never even asked us if \"everything was OK\" or \"did you enjoy your meal\".    There is potential here,  but the nice decor and decent pizza are going to waste with this inattentive, lacksadasical service.",

The service was just delightful, the staff being excited to share with us what is special about their offerings (hint, it's all in the ingredients which are top notch, all directly from Italy *or* very local) yet not overwhelming. We ordered a pizza and a large salad to share and loved both. I accidentally ordered us a pizza with meat on it (we're vegetarians) and though it was my error they offered to replace it right away, seeming truly concerned for our experience. We insisted on keeping it as we could easily pick the meat off, but just so thoughtful! The salad was *huge*, splitting it between us we still felt we could have shared it with 1-2 more people as a pre-pizza appetizer. We got gelato too - all from Italy or local Prairie Fruits Farm (goat milk based) - and it was divine. When we mentioned it was our anniversary they brought us two lovely espressos on the house to enjoy our gelato with.  The pizza crust and oils were lovely. Are their things they are still working out? Yes, I think so. When it was clear we were splitting our salad the server offered to bring us another vessel to share it from . . . and brought us the base of a weird to-go container. Little things about the experience were clunky like that, but they were too minimal to remove a star from the review to our minds. If the kindness and delightful attitude of a staff truly proud of where they work is spice to your food (as it is for us) then this is a total 5, on food alone perhaps a 4, but certainly something I can't wait to try again and take family to try out!",
