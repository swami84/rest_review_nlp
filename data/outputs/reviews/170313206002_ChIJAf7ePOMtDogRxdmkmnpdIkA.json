Most restaurants, diners, etc. have okay coffee. It'll wake you up, but might not be the best cup. Not here! The coffee was definitely better than any cup you'll have at Bucks or Peets, so that was a pleasant surprise. AND unlimited refills on the coffee as well as getting a to-go cup if you ask (plus only 2.50.) When the food arrived, it was obvious that the value was there. Every plate was jam packed with food! You also get pancakes with a lot of the entrees which is super nice if you can't decide what you are feeling. Overall, a great brunch spot and hope they do well! Definitely will be back.",

The host never even told us about the hold herself, I had to ask what was taking so long. She went and asked the manager and the hold was going to be another half hour!
