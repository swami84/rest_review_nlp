Would definitely return next time I'm in the area. The style is largely traditional with a little bit of creative twist. Favorite piece of the night was NZ king salmon topped with torched tamato. The refreshing sourness of the tomato went superbly with the richness of the salmon belly. The sesame tofu pudding as dessert was also excellent. Other good pieces included shima aji, hotate, and unagi. Personally I found that the more creative pieces, such as otoro+uni+caviar and akami+torched mushrooms+truffles were a little too much for me, but that's just my taste. The chef uses less rice in the sushi compared with other places, but this does not mess up the balance and I still ended up very full from my meal.",

I heard about this place from the nycomakase Instagram page. We've been to Tanoshi and Nakazawa so far but what we loved about Sushi Lin was that although we might say the portions are slightly smaller (thumb length vs index finger length), the flavors are very innovative and unique, particularly the use of their house made soy sauce and truffle. We ordered the sushi/sashimi omakase for $80, which gave us four sashimi dishes (with at least two pieces each) and 8 sushi pieces, ending with one handroll - which was a little too oily for my taste, but for the most part they were all so delicious it was hard to choose a favourite to order extra pieces of. We also ordered the oyster sampler, which could have used a little less sauce, as it was overpowering, but the textures of the oysters were delicious. We would definitely come here again and try the chef's omakase at the counter.",

Generally speaking of course, you get what you pay for but that being said the very high end of sushi dining that can top at $600 per person is out of reach for most people. For me then the trick becomes to find the rare pearl in the vast middle ground between grocery store sushi and super expensive Omakases.  Sushi Lin is such a place and I'd challenge anyone to find better value than their $26 sushi dinner comprising of nine pieces of sushi and one Maki roll. The sushi is simply delicious, fresh and prepared with obvious skill and care. It will therefore not surprise anyone to read that the two chefs and co-owners are veterans of high end sushi places. Although this might make a future reservation more difficult, I couldn't recommend it any more, it's a true gem.  PS Omakase options priced at $60, $80 and $100 are also on offer.",

After finding out about this place, I go about twice a week and always opt for the omikase and a roll. There are 4 omikase choices, each giving you an overview of the menu. Furthermore, the staff and chefs are extremely friendly and go above and beyond to make the customer happy.  They bring you a warm towel when you first sit down and are quick to refill your water/tea. Honestly, I have nothing but good things to say about Sushi Lin, and I am on vacation right now, dreaming to get back to the city to get some more sushi. 10/10 would recommend!",

The perfect balance of salt, rice and charred fatty fish melts into your mouth into a tsunami of flavor.  I'm gonna work hard in my job and make more money so I can afford to come here more often!

The quality of food and service at Sushi Lin blew my expectations away. Instead of focusing on different kinds of sushi rolls like Geido, Sushi Lin is a mellower joint for the serious fish lovers. I ordered the Sashimi Dinner and the Chawamushi. The former was incredibly fresh (see photos) and the latter was delicate and delightful.  My server was attentive and professional. I would most certainly come back to Sushi Lin for its high-quality sashimi and tranquil ambience. Highly recommend!",
