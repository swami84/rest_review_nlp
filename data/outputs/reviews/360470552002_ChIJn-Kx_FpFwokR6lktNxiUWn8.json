I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box ($7.50) with a Thai ice tea ($3.50). I also ordered a taro bubble tea to go ($3.50). Each lunch order comes with a choice of soup or salad. I ordered the miso soup, which I thought tasted about average. My mom got the salad and thought it tasted average.  The chicken and broccoli were delicious. However, to some, it might be on the saltier side and has an excess amount of sauce. Personally, I love foods that are salty and has a lot of sauce. The chicken teriyaki bento box came with two shrimp shumai pieces with a very generous amount of chicken and vegetables. The chicken teriyaki was on par with other places in terms of taste and texture.",
