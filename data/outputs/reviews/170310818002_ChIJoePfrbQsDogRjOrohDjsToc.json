Finding our server was very difficult and we had to ask for items multiple times before we would receive them. The food was very disappointing in both flavor and quality. The wedge salad was not a wedge but rather, a thin slice from an iceberg head. The dressing was very runny and lacked the strong flavor you should have with a blue cheese. My filet mignon (cooked rare as requested) was sadly not a quality cut of meat. A filet should melt in your mouth, but I found myself struggling to chew it. It also sadly lacked any flavor that you should be getting from a prime cut of filet. The French style mashed potatoes were also a disappointment. French style mashed potatoes are generally a cheesy blend of potatoes with hints of rosemary and garlic. (Aligot) Sadly, these potatoes tasted like a blend of real potatoes and instant mashed potatoes with little to no seasoning. For the price of $260 for two adults, I'm disappointed. I've dined at many exclusive restaurants across the US, especially in Miami, and I'm saddened that this steakhouse fell very short of expectations. $260 should get you an incredible culinary experience; not a bland, disappointing meal.",

There was no ambiance, the candle on the table wasn\u2019t even lit. I was quite disappointed.  I\u2019ve been to many steakhouses that are always so accommodating for special occasions. Our food was okay but the bedding for the branzino reminded me of rice-a-roni and I was not a fan. The steak and drinks were good. The service was a bit subpar but they did provide complimentary champagne. Based on my overall experience, I\u2019ll likely choose another steakhouse when we dine.",

First of all, we were told that we would only have 1.5 hrs to dine when we were seated. However, when I booked on open table, it clearly said up to 1 hr and 45 minutes for parties up to 6. After 1.5 hrs from being there, we were told our time was up and we had to leave. I literally had to chug my wine so we could leave! We had just spent $300 for dinner, and I couldn\u2019t even enjoy my wine.I understand, we are in a middle of a pandemic, but don\u2019t advertise a different time limit when making a reservation online. Also, if you are going to enforce the time limit, be fair and do it for all your guests. There were several other couples that we there before us and were still there when we left.  Second of all, our waiter barely checked in on us. He would walk by and not even ask how things were.  Third, I asked for my steak to be cooked medium.It was brought to me black and blue. I had to flagged our waiter to tell  him it needed to be cooked more. This took more time from our 1.5 hr table time limit. It was brought back to me, but this time rare. They still couldn\u2019t get the temperature right. The steaks were also extremely salty. We were not compensated for this bad food experience, but instead, were kicked out after 1.5 hrs. Unbelievable!  I have been to many many different steakhouses in the city, and GT prime is by far the worst one! Bad staff and food. Save yourself some money and do not go. You will regret it.",

I did the Snake River Farms American Strip \u2018Wagyu\u2019...which was highly recommended by our awesome waiter Ben. It was by far one of the best steaks I\u2019ve ever had!

The food not worth the money, I had an American wagyu the texture was like rubber and omg over salted is an understatement, and I love salt. The others in our group had a prime ny strip and it was not over salted. Wife had the fish and gnocchi the fish is fine the gnocchi was horrible. Mac and cheese was good but not what I want to be the best part of a meal at a high end steak house. We are no strangers to fine steak houses and Gt prime not the best. Maybe an off night but won\u2019t be back.",

It seemed like there were several empty tables so idk why there was a wait. They led us to the very awkward upstairs section of the restaurant, where there is bad LED lighting and only 4 tables. I requested that we move downstairs which they accommodated immediately. We're pretty young so maybe we were being judged for dining at a nice restaurant, which is why they put us upstairs. We ended up in an awesome booth in the corner of the main dining room, probably one of the best seats in the house. We ordered the lump crab and avocado app which was delish and super fresh. We ordered a bottle of decent red wine, the Chicago Style ribeye, a filet mignon, mashed potatoes and brussels. Our food was fab, steaks were cooked to perfection which is obviously our #1 biggest concern when dining at a steakhouse. My only true complaint is that we felt very rushed throughout our dinner. Maybe because it was NYE, but after sitting down at our table late, ordering, and eating, we were done within an hour. We kept asking if we could take our time to order as well but the waiter insisted that the food would take a while so we could take our time. Sure enough, it was out 10 minutes later. I'd probably return on a night that isn't going to be so busy to give them another chance.",

I would not recommend this to anyone, for more details read on. Service/Food: Everyone in our section ended up getting the wrong orders at least once.  the table next to us got the wrong order twice.  We also got food so fast that we never got a chance to enjoy our cocktails, despite talking to the server (based on the advice of the table next to us) about wanting to slow our meal down and enjoy our courses.  We ended up with plates arriving on top of other plates.  When they brought me the wrong cut of meat and I sent it back the correct cut of meat wasn't cooked properly.  I just ate it because at this point I didn't want to deal with it anymore.  We didn't get any of the sauces that we ordered until we asked a second time for them, and the server never apologized or addressed it in anyway.  In fact, once our food showed our server pretty much disappeared.  The cooking of the steaks showed a lack of interest or knowledge in that they were either over cooked or dramatically under cooked, or actually the wrong cut.  The french fries were soggy.  The foie gras was lovely. The tomato salad was OK. Seating: We were seated in a VERY intimate table where one of us was on a shared bench and the other was on a nice seat.  This is normally fine except in this case the shared bench was worn and extra soft causing the person on the bench to be approximately 6 inches lower than the person in the chair.  It made it hard to eat at the table.  In addition the tables were so small and close together that we were basically eating with the two tables next to us.  We decided to not order anything for after dinner because our experience was so bad.",

We went to celebrate a friend's birthday  and it was an amazing experience for all 22 of us. Everyone in our party really enjoyed all of the dishes, that we shared as a group, ranging from the 3 Seafood Towers, to all of the shareable sides (mashed potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, & succulent mushrooms). The entrees ranged from salmon, to ribeye, to bison tenderloin, to wagyu, and all proved to exceed expectations & caused me to (selfishly) plot when to come back to try each & every entree myself. The bar service was outstanding, and the libations produced at the bar were all  amazing and consistent. The servers did an exceptional job juggling our drink orders, food orders, birthday speeches, & more drink orders, & more food orders. The service that we received was truly top notch & I am grateful that we all had such a memorable experience for our great friend's birthday. We will definitely be back!",

For the prices, I would have expected slightly better food. The appetizers were good, but the entrees were nothing special for the price. Someone in our party ordered off the regular menu (not restaurant week) and the steak was incredibly tough and fatty. The restaurant did offer him a new meal, but I wouldn\u2019t have expected that experience for a $50-60 steak. Overall fun dinner spot, but I think there are better places for the price/food. The drinks were good, so may be a better cocktail/appetizer spot.",

They serve super fresh seafood here from their other restaurant, GT Seafood. If you have never tried wagyu beef, this is the place for it! I highly recommend reservations for The weekend.

My Dad and I already had the steaks we want picked out before hand.  45 day dry age was very tasty. Love that funk and can't get enough. Filet with truffles was extremely tender.  The A5 wagyu is a game changer and instantly makes any restaurant a destination option.  Worth every penny, savor each bite. The tender richness of A5 cannot be surpassed.  Thank you for letting my Dad and I dine with Lou Brock and we'll be sure to tell others and we will be back when we make it back to Chicago.  The service here is outstanding. Food is great.

Don't get the dry aged 45 days prime ribeye. It's $98. not worth it. Was not that tender and just not right. I never had a bad ribeye (more then $30) at a steakhouse.  2- don't get the rabbit dish. our waiter/waitress both pushed for it. it was weird tasting.  3- steal tartare and chips were good. but not wow.  4- mashed potato was so so so creamy mostly butter  5- asparagus was classic and good.  6- bone-in filet mignon was the best I ever had! two friends ordered them and they were incredibly flavorful and tender. I really wished I ordered it or if I could return the ribeye and get this first..  7- crab legs are just ok..small portion.  8- chocolate layer cake was OK. strawberry dessert was good.  This steakhouse has no complementary bread.  Briefly, I would come back for the bone-in filet mignon. Don't get the dry aged ribeye here. It's very overpriced. Maybe the regular ribeye here would taste better.",

She was an awesome server attentive but not intrusive. Although this place is higher end dining it's not pretentious. Its chic and modern. Nice change from the old school type steakhouse. Now the food. It was very good. We had the seafood ceviche and jumbo shrimp as starters. Both were good. I then ordered the Japanese a5 filet, my husband ordered Kansas city strip. Steaks were great.  A5 was melt in your mouth as it should be. I have eaten A5 before and this was a very good cut compared to the rest. Sides were good, ordered asparagus and mashed potatoes and summer truffle pasta as a side as well. This was the best one. If you love truffles like me don't pass this dish up. Overall very happy with GT great place for a steak. Darien our server also gave us champagne with my birthday dessert. It was a nice surprise thank you Darien. If you are looking for a modern fresh steakhouse visit GT Prime.",

Cocktails were very good. I had the Bourbon cocktail with bone marrow. The sides were awesome. I think the shishito peppers could have used a bit more char, but we're still really good.

So Gross! The Service was not great kinda sucked the ridiculous prices  and you go home hungry.  I know my steakhouses all I can say THIS PLACE IS a Overpriced Disneyland lux chalet look restaurant majorTOURIST TRAP And critics saying that some of us don't have good taste, you know nothing about us. Your just doing your job and of course your going to be waited on hand and foot because of who you are. Steak lovers BEWARE And ladies if your single and looking for a guy this is the place when I went almost every table were men my husband called it a sausage fest.  Reccomendation go to prime house on rush they have wonderful Himalaya age salt room different age steaks that you can tour customer service is OUTSTANDING.

One of the best most enjoyable and affordable meals (for the quality) that I have had in a while. Rabbit, duck, foie gras, jamon iberico, mushrooms, octopus, etc etc did not find one dish that was not devoured. Basically we did not try any main courses apart from the shared steak selection plate and by that time the 4oz version was enough and a great finish to the meal. Carrot cake to finish, probably would have avoided in retrospect. Got to bank on more than $100 per person if taking wine (they have a reasonable selection), but really worth it just for the quality of the food",

We arrived on time and our reservation was in tact as ordered. We were greeted by very friendly Valets who quickly opened both cab and front doors as they welcomed us to GT. The floor manger and two hostess were friendly, addressed our host by her name, and we were escorted to our table . The restaurant is very appropriately decorated and comfortably furnished. I mention this as so many Chicago up scale eateries have arranged the tables so close that one has difficulty getting in and out and private conversations don't exist. Service was on spot from delivery of the wine list, menus and a brief but accurate description of featured items. A bottle of \"Chateau Durfort - Vivens, Margaux 2006\" was selected, properly presented, chilled and d\u00e9cantered. The General Manager stopped by briefly to welcome us and offer any questions or explanations needed and exchanged cards. A sampling of appetizers, entr\u00e9es and desserts got the three of us gave a varied and filling of GT's bill of fare and the ability and skills of their culinary team. A \"high five\" to the kitchen crew!! Throughout the evening staff and service was friendly and impeccable. Five stars to GT Prime  Rick Price, FMP \"2006 Kentucky Restaurateur of The Year\"",

I've been here twice, the first time the group I was with got a mixture of different cuts of meat - 5 pieces of 4 different types. They were all really well cooked, but they are pretty bite sized, so we supplemented with sides. The crafted cocktails are excellent, I had both the smoking gun and the x-ray yankee zulu, suited well for fans of whiskey forward cocktails. The second time I came back I didn't feel it was worth spending the price of the cuts again so I got the burger, which was cooked very well to my liking (medium rare) and tasted great. All in all this place is worth the experience for a special occasion, but given how hard it is to get a table here and the high menu prices, it's probably not going to be a regular dinner place for most people.",

They tried to seat my girlfriend and I here and we immediately said hell no. After being put at a much nicer table we actually laughed as we watched 2 other couples go up the stairs and then come back down seeking better accommodations. Our server was meh. It was Valentine's day and he was probably busy but he really didn't seem too concerned about being attentive. He wasn't bad, just not amazing. The meats, a selection of bison, lamb, skirt, and wagyu beef were top quality albeit pretty darn red for the recommended medium rare and was quite cold if you ask me. The brussel sprouts, bone marrow, and creme brulee all rocked as did our cocktails and wine. Overall, it was good, maybe great, certainly not exceptional.",
