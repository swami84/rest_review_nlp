It's like a mix of of corn flour and pita chips. I honestly ate the entire bowl. Queso was pipping hot and truly queso. Not floury like chipotles and not fake like Tostitos. The CHICKEN WINGS. We got the blue cheese wings. So so good. I think I'd come to tiki just for the wings. Meat fell off the bone. For tacos we got the Kailua pork, jerk chicken and fish. The pork also fell apart in my mouth and I loved the spicy mayo drizzle on the fish ones. Can't forget about the poke! It tasted super fresh and the mango pieces added a super nice fruity taste that complemented the savory dish. Last but not least we had the shaved ice! So colorful and bursting with flavor! Can't wait to return. Awesome location for a quick lunch... forget about chipotle tiki Taco is where it's at!",

Located on 2010 P Street NW, Tiki Taco is one of those hole-in-the-wall that make all your dreams come true.  Their food\u2019s super fresh, super affordable, and super effing delicious.  They specialize in three menu items:  tacos, pokes, and wings.  If you like sashimi, their shoyu ahi poke ($12) is a must-try.  It was prepared with Maui sweet onions, scallions, soy sauce, and sesame, and it was exquisite.  Also make sure to get an order of their wings - they're cheap and super flavorful! I tried them in Jerky Blue, and it's heaven for blue cheese lovers.  Their spiced pineapple flavor sounds dope though.  And last but not least, their tacos - these were everything and then some.  My favorite was their Crispy Sesame Tofu (with green papaya salad, toasted coconut, and sweet chili sauce), but their Kalbi Beef (with sesame watercress namul and hoisin crema) was also delicious.  Pro tip:  save room for dessert because they have shaved ice here with pretty much every flavor imaginable, lol.  Happy eating, friends!",

Getting shaved ice really brought me back, and the gummi worm you get on top is a nice touch for the nostalgia train.  The owner is extremely friendly.  This place is a good alternative to Surfside, as it's open pretty late (not 24/7, not that it matters to me) and is on about the same quality and price level with a far shorter line (and wait overall).",
