The Hamachi nigiri at Sakana is the best piece of sushi I've ever eaten. It's not fussy. It's not fancy. It is EXACTLY what excellent nigiri should be. The ratio of fish to rice and the size of the bite is perfect (please don't change a thing about that). The fish is perfectly cut and super fresh. It's a perfect bite of food and well-priced. Used to go to Ittoku for sushi but they've been slipping. This is my new go to. The rolls were good but the nigiri stole the show.  Edit: I don't get this place. I went back the day after the last review for lunch and the sushi was atrocious. It was unrecognizable compared to what I had the Sunday night before.  The fish was cut in a skimpy way and had tendons in it. Way too much rice compared to fish in the nigiri. I'd give it a 2/5. I figured that it MUST have been different folks in the kitchen so I ordered on another Sunday evening. Again, it was like a different restarant. Not nearly as bad as the Monday lunch but nowhere near as good as two weeks ago. The fish was watery and looked like it was cut down it's length for some reason (to make it shape better to the rice? I have no idea.). It was maybe a 3/5. So I'm changing my review from a 5 to a 4. Consistency is so key for a restaurant. I'd much rather frequent an OK place that is consistent than someplace which alternates between being amazing and meh. Whoever was making sushi the night of April 5, make sure to hold to that person's standards and this place will be a gem. I'm gonna hold off a few moths until I try this place again.",

There were a lot of options on the menu, but I eventually decided on the Hokkaido and Dragon. One of them had seared scallop on it which was delicious which gave the entire roll a roast-y seared flavor and it was awesome; I've never had sushi like that before. Both rolls were really fresh, and I liked all the ingredients in both. I really enjoyed my meal, and service was pretty good too. The rolls came out to be around $30 post-tax which is a bit pricey, but for the quality, I would go again.",
