We had the pate and persimmon dishes as appetizers, chicken roulade and scallops as entrees and chocolate nemesis and biscoff tart for dessert. All the courses were somehow sweet without a depth of flavor. The pate was not a pate but a mousse and there seemed to be something pureed/mousse in each dish with the mascarpone from the persimmon appetizer seemingly repeated in the tart dessert. The chocolate nemesis was a flourless chocolate cake, nothing more or less. I would recommend Petit Louis for French bistro food.",

Not only do I love the environment but the food and service were absolutely amazing. We ordered the grilled swordfish and bavette. For appetizers we ordered the saint marcellin which we thought would be a consolation prize because the pat\u00e9 was sold out but that is just no true. It was so good we decided to get the half wheel of camebert which was amazing. The cheeses and in house bread were perfect, you have to order them. The swordfish and  bavette were delicious, but the bread and cheese is what really stole the show in my opinion. Absolutely loved our experience, I highly recommend you put in your reservation and try them for yourself.",

Amazing flavors and the flatbread which is made in house was also, amazing! I will be going back for sure! New favorite!!!!!",

Both were really good, perfectly sized and not heavy. Scallops were tender and cooked to perfection. For dessert, we had the blueberry and gooseberry tart which was amazing and wasn't overly sweet and hit all of my personal flavor profiles! This isn't a big restaurant, so service was great and the atmosphere was intimate. The bathrooms were gender neutral and had a cute waiting area outside.

We asked Rosemary, one of the owners, to suggest the best items on the menu and she brought out diverse and delicious plates to complement our wine. We ordered two of the duck gnocchi, but the celery salad (of all things) might have actually been my favorite. Leave room for the yuzu cheesecake for dessert! Lovely atmosphere as well - warm, inviting, modern and playful. Can\u2019t wait to come back.",

The celery salad was a bright segue into our main courses. The steak tartare was a standout -- served pre-seasoned and with a seared crust that provides an interesting and approachable texture for those trying this dish for the first time.  Will's Lyonnais roots are evident in his imaginative take on French classics with a twist.  Portions are sized so that a couple could comfortably share three dishes and a starter or dessert.  The wine list is reasonably priced and sourced from undiscovered French producers personally selected by Rosemary.  This is destined to become a favorite neighborhood restaurant  for drop-ins and patrons of The Charles!",
