But prospective visitors need not question their sanity, as eyes do not decieve in this regard. Thanks to the success of seemingly futuristic technology, buyers need only tap in at the entrance gates with their phones using a barcode ID found in the Amazon Go app, which links their payment details. Then, once inside, all shoppers need to do is pick up the items they with Amazon keeping track of what is selected or put back. Upon exiting, Amazon tallies the items the customer selected and left with, and within a few minutes, it sends a shockingly accurate receipt of the these items with payment confirmation. Not only is this technology a marvel, but it massively up speeds the retail purchase experience all while achieving low labor overhead costs (a store attendant is available to assist with questions/inquiries). Plus, the selection of ready-to-wear meals has proven quite delicious for this reviewer; the roast beef sandwich on a pretzel bun is highly recommended \ud83d\udc4c.",
