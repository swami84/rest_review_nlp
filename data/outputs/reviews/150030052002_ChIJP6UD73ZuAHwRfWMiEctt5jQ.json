Although they had all the classics, nothing really stood out in their assortment as special or unique.  Additionally, the dim sum that they did have was mediocre at best.  Order 4 choices from the cart and an item from the kitchen.  Two out of the items where not steamed hot enough and were a bit on the dry side.  One of them was the pork hash or better known as shumai.  There was another dumpling that we ordered and although the minced pork and other goodies inside were tasty, the wrapper was tough and chewy.  The spareribs where and chicken feet were very meaty and tasty as well as properly steamed to be served hot. I did order a plate of choy sum from kitchen. It was a very generous plate of excellent quality choy sum that I thought was cooked perfectly.  The service was nice and friendly although a little lacking on follow up attention.  Value was so so based on my experience.  I am not going to put this place down as it wasn't that bad, but there is room for much improvement, so I have to rate them a 3.  Maybe once things get back to a bit of more normal if ever (pre COVID-19), I will give them another chance.",

The elevator in the building is quite old so it takes longer to operate than usual. The restaurant is large for family dining. It is good place for dim sum that is for  limited quantity during lunch hours. Waiting time is short. I always like the hot tea here, too. Well-recommended for Chinese food.
