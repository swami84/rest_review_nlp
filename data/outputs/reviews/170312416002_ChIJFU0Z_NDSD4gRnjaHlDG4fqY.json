My delivery took an hour and half to arrive, when I was given an estimate of no more than an hour. Called the restuarant twice to inquire after the initial hour, to be told it was on it's way. Did finally receive the order, no explanation as to the delay. The food is good, but you gotta decide if it's worth the wait (even when dining in). Also, the portion sizes seem to have shrunk, my most recent delivery has a signature maki with only 6 small rolls. I used to love this place, but have had to update my rating with the declining experiences.",

For maki rolls tried the volcano which was okay (not a fan of tempura in my maki rolls). However also tried the spooky roll which is a warm, spicy maki roll which was delicious! So much so that we ordered another one of em. Service was a bit slow considering only 3 tables were occupied and it took a good 20-30mins for our rolls to come hence 4star. Got free street parking outside which was nice too. Would recommend especially for the spooky roll! Happy eating!",

I was pleasantly surprised by the service and overall experience. I was greeted at the door immediately and seated right away at the bar. Given water right off the bat and emptied it quickly since I was very thirsty and it was then refilled right away. Love it!  The server was on top of everything throughout the quick in and out experience. The sushi maker on the other side of the bar was pleasant and engaged with me.  The food was tasty and fresh. I got the Triple S and it was my first time having sweet potato in sushi. They even threw in a tempura sweet potato app for free for checking in on facebook! (Smart Social Move)  What drove me to write this review is that it wasn't just one person involved in my great first experience at Seadog, upon leaving I think 5 different people thanked me for coming in. Thank You Seadog Staff. I'll be back.",

Unfortunately, my experiences tonight make me wonder how they achieved it. The appetizers and salads were quite tasty, but the main courses and overall experience were not good at all.  We learned upon arriving that they will not seat parties over 4 outside, so despite there being plenty of room, we weren't allowed to put two tables together. Our waitress did not speak English very well, so it was hard to get more information on the various dishes, and we had to repeat our requests to other staff so we would get what we needed.  Dinner was horrible, they forgot to make the food for two of our party, and the food that did come out was too salty to eat. They did not seem to care that the food was largely uneaten, and charged us full price for everything we did not eat. I definitely will not be going back there again.",
