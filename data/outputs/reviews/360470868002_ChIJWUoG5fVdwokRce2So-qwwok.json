Very unprofessional and its get annoying sometimes.But their food is good enough to make u wanna keep buying from them.They just have a-lot to work on tho.I recommend calling before ordering online just to check if the food they have on their menu still available.",

The delivery time was right on target, the sealing of the bags was a nice touch. The jus grenadia and the boullion I ordered was perfect(the flavor was perfect and the spices were right on point). Overall, I have to say you guys Rock! Please keep making great food and monitor closely your customer service. I definitely will come back.",

They didn\u2019t send a notes or anything , they just sent it like nothing was wrong. Very dishonest and I\u2019m highly annoyed.",

People who love Haitian food usually get pretty passionate about who they think makes the best Haitian food.  Enjoy Eat puts that debate to rest.  Legume Beef - delicious!  Soup Joumou - BEYOND delicious!  Even their rice (white or rice with beans - doesn't matter) is incredible!!!!  Haven't tried every thing on their menu yet but I'll work my way through it since they make no mistakes.  Enjoy Eat, you have a customer for life now.  I can't imagine ordering Haitian food from anywhere else.  It would be subpar.",
