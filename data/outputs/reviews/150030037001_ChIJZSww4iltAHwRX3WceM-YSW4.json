        "caption": "Me & my wife love coming here, it's one of the few places that we can both agree on!! This is a great place to come and unwind after a long day at work or stressful day at school.  [FOOD] We usually get our own 3 for $5 cookie deal which allows us to pick our own cookies that we want. Plus if they are not busy they actually offer to warm it up making it so much better especially with a cold cup of milk (which they do sell). Personally my favorites right now are the OREO CHEESECAKE COOKIE and the FRUIT LOOPS MARSHMALLOW BUTTER COOKIES, though my wife really likes the PUMPKIN SNICKER DOODLE.  [SET UP] They have a countertop and about four stools where you can sit and relax while eating your desserts, plus across the way there are several more tables and chairs available too.",

It is just a small little show in the Ohana Market place, but well worth the stop to check out their amazing cookies.  Ube is one of my favorites flavors for sweets and they have this amazing Ube cream cheese cookie that is just to die for.  It is even better when they warm it up a bit for you.  talk about a sweet warm comforting flavor boom exploding in your mouth.  It is nice to see such love put into the products that are offered at this little concession.  The service is very friendly and caring with lots of suggestions to help you find that sweet fix that you need to fulfill.  I think I gained a few ponds just waiting to get my cookie fix on while ordering.  This place is well worth a check out and I plan to visit again.",
