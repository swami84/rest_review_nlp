I then waited at the restaurant for another 45 minutes until they were able to complete my order. No apology, no attempt to make it up to me, just said \"here you go\" and went back to work. Again, terrible service, clueless employees, and worst music ever inside the restaurant.  Wonder how long they this place will stay open.",

        "caption": "This restaurant just opened 3/19/2019, and is not really ready to open but started taking orders for pizza. They have no menu, no price list, few people who know how to use the cash register and the fountain drink dispenser is still being connected up. They invited people in on the 19th for free pizza samples. They have lots of thin crust pizza pies in a variety of toppings ready to sell slices from (see my pictures). They will supposedly offer specials for 2 slices and a beverage but aren't offering those yet. I am all for new small businesses succeeding, but should have insisted on finding out what they charged for 2 slices before I ordered. The adage \"if you have to ask, you can't afford it\" certainly applied here. My 2 slices arrived, and i was shocked to be charged over $8 for them with no beverage. Ouch! While they tasted okay, they were too expensive. I hope that Wall Street Pizza (which is not on Wall Street, BTW) adjusts their prices to more closely match what others are charging for pizza slices downtown ($7 with tax for 2 slices and a large fountain drink). I won't be back until they are more affordable. But i encourage you to stop in and take a look, because I do want to support small businesses-- if i can afford to.",

The crust is thin, light and airy, with a great crunch - not doughy or tough and the slices were big! They employees were welcoming and very nice. I stopped in today, and they had an array of pies!!!",
