I was a little nervous to try a new place, because I had my bosses boss in town, but it looked amazing, so I decided to give it a try. Great choice! Her Boss stopped by my desk to let me know they were \"phenomenal\" sandwiches. I had a Tuscan Turkey one myself, and it was amazing. I loved the bread they are on , very hearty! I will definitely use Firenze again in the future!",
