I'm allergic.\" He rudely replied and said, \"That should've been the first thing you told me.\" I canceled my order immediately so I can't comment on the food. I understand I have food allergies and I need to make sure I keep myself safe, but considering this place is known for making random combinations, it should be expected to leave a random fruit out here and there without being scolded. Don't take this the wrong way but...screw this place.",
