Recently installed in Chicago, we\u2019ve heard about Virtue for a while way before we moved here and we liked the team\u2019s background and the fact that they made effort to reopen the indoor service. As often for those special occasions only two imposed menues were offered. Generally, imposed menue are not the best to rank a restaurant but regarding the reduced offer of tables because of covid, I made my decision hoping that the Menu composition would meet the reputation. The oysters were great and new to me, although not very sustainable with this amount of not recycled salt. The cooking point was surprising and we did feel the southern influence in the seasoning. The salad was probably one of the biggest disappointment of the last 24 months for the standing of the place. I could have done better with my fridge left overs.. The main plates were good but pretty standards. I was weird out that the waitress was surprised when I asked if the Filet Mignon was Pork since it is the main used meat in the country where the dish comes from. Beef it was, good quality but again, nothing mind blowing, we were looking for the thing that was supposed to make this place special. Big thumb up for the pastry chef, great Cheesecake and one of the best chocolate truffles I had for a while. This saved the diner. We would be willing to try this restaurant again but with the possibility to choose \u00e0 la carte options and with a high expectation to find what made this place a big deal.",

Before we could finish our first round, the waiter brought the check without even asking if we wanted another round, if we wanted water or if we were done ordering altogether. (We did notice folks of other skin color being served with more diligence) While we took offense to this, as we felt like we were being rushed and unattended to, we still stayed against our better judgement. We had $100 gift certificate that we wanted to use for our $60 meal. (We ordered appetizers for the most part) After calling the manager from the back and having what seemed like a 15 minute meeting, we were told by the waiter that the gift certificate would be honored. (As if they weren\u2019t the establishment that sold the gift certificate to begin with.) and then the manager (a white male) had the audacity to tell us that the tip was not included. As if that\u2019s not common knowledge. We are a group of young BLACK SUCCESSFUL women... and you don\u2019t think we have the least bit of  common sense to know that we have to leave a tip? And he didn\u2019t even mention the balance left on the gift certificate, didn\u2019t ask if we wanted to order more drinks.. didn\u2019t ask how the food was. Nothing. Just walked off.

The vibe here is intimate & trendy with soothing music piped in. As restaurants go I'll just say that it's size is relatively small although one must consider that the other side is dedicated just to the bar area alone. I reserved a spot for the Sunday evening b4 Christmas and it was crowded which is to be expected with a hot new eatery especially being located in Hyde Park. If you are familiar with the area then you know parking can be (and usually is) a nightmare but there are parking lots available around the corner. Upon entering, the wait time was less than 5 minutes which was appreciated considering I did have a reservation.",

Our party of six experienced great service, socially distant dining, attentive staff and exceptionally amazing food. We ordered different entr\u00e9es but each couple gravitated towards the cornbread, greens and macaroni and cheese. The sides alone will fill you up and the portions are pretty sizable so you can share...if you're in the sharing mood. The short ribs were tender, shrimp and grits were amazing and the fish entr\u00e9es seasoned well and cooked to perfection. We enjoyed every bite and had a little leftover to relive the experience all over again with leftovers the next day. We didn't leave room for dessert but if we had we would've went with the banana pudding. I enjoyed my mocktail, the hummingbird but our friends didn't love their cocktails as much one felt the basil in the drink was a little overpowering. Our tab was about $277 with gratuity and everyone left with full bellies and praises. Even the usually picky ones of our party that always order chicken fried hard or the one that questions whether each dish has pork or beef added for flavoring. Virtue managed to please them all.",

Creative menu of southern classics including blackened catfish, fried gizzards, greens, etc. My two favorite things I've had: a porkchop special I had 2 weeks ago that was so large it made two meals, and their incredible banana pudding.  Full disclosure, I last ate there in person 8 months ago. Since then I have only gotten takeout. It's hard to capture the magic of an upscale restaurant with takeout, but somehow they manage to do it.",

        "caption": "It was painfully apparent that at Virtue Restaurant and Bar every patron is not created equal.  On August 27th at 7:30 pm I brought a guest to Virtue for a birthday dinner.  During these challenging times, it is very important to me to support local businesses and especially black-owned businesses.  When we arrived we were seated immediately, before being seated our temperature was taken and that made me more comfortable with coming out during these challenging times.  When my waiter came to the table he told us that Chicago requires masks until drinks and food are served.  We were specifically told as staff \u201cwe can\u2019t even talk to you without a mask\u201d we were sitting in the outdoor patio and we compiled, but as I looked around many couples and families didn\u2019t have on a mask.  Our bottled water came, and within 5 minutes we were approached by another gentleman that we later found to be the general manager (I confirmed that by looking at his picture on the restaurant website).  The GM began to give us a 5-minute speech on how we are required to wear masks.  I was drinking water at the time.  I asked are you telling me I need to wear this mask in between sips and his response was yes.  I again complied and just wanted to salvage the evening.  Here is when the experience was ruined. It was a beautiful night in Chicago so I asked the hostess if she could take a picture of my guest and me with my cell phone.  I was told that she would only take our picture if we wore out masks during the picture.  I asked could she stand 6 feet away to take the picture without the mask and she refused, we declined the picture.  Sitting next to us was a couple that never wore a mask.  Not only did they never wear but it was obvious they were VIPs to the manager and staff.  For the next 30 minutes, we watched staff member after staff member come and greet these guest. NO MASK for the patron, not only did they talk to the guest they embraced him.  Holding long conversations without social distancing, this was not one staff member I counted at least 9 different Virtue staff.  I brought this to the attention of my server and they said everyone was happy to see him and we know him.  I explain my position that every customer should be treated the same.  With over 170,000 deaths in the US, I have no problem with a reasonable request for COVID safety but they should apply to everyone.  I asked to speak to the manager and once it was brought to his attention he could not dispute what I was observing.  That he and his staff applied the COVID protocol to who they wanted to when they wanted to.  The general manager apologized but changed nothing.  After our conversation, he stood within 5 feet of these \u201cSPECIAL\u201d customers and continued to watch his staff, talk, laugh, and physically embrace these patrons. My stomach turned with frustration with this clear lack of consistency and I no longer was interested in my meal.  For my $90 meal, I was told that I needed to wear my mask in between sips of water, I was given a 5-minute speech on why we must follow the safety rules, told by staff they couldn\u2019t even talk to me without a mask, and that they couldn\u2019t snap a quick picture of my guest and me from a safe distance. All of this within the first 20 minutes of my visit. Virtue does not treat every customer the same.  Safety in these COVID times is very important. Patrons have a responsibility to protect each other by wearing a mask.  As a mental health first responder, I understand this better than most.  But, Virtue also has a responsibility to its customers.  Treat every customer the same, follow the city protocol, hold your staff accountable, and use some common-sense practices as we all work through these challenging times. My plan is not to go to Virtue again.  What I am requesting is a phone call from the owner to further share my point of view on my experience.",

        "caption": "1st time experience at this trendy restaurant in Hyde Park area for my Birthday and it will be my last. Let's start with what went well. They required masks, and did a temperature check upon arrival. We made reservations for outdoor seating. That was prompt. We were told by the hostess and then the server not to remove our masks until we were sat and received our drinks or food. That was fine and we had experienced this at other venues during these new Covid times. We were asked by a third staff if we wanted water. We said yes, and received bottled water. Now I'm not sure about you, but I haven't mastered drinking water through my mask. And last time I checked it qualified as a drink. We removed our masks and started drinking our water. We immediately received a visit from the general manager. We didn't understand why he was at our table and didn't find out until later that he was the manager. When he came to the table he asked us to put our mask on and said he could not even continue to speak to us without a mask. We complied. He then proceeded to tell us again that we must wear our masks. He was very lengthy and had the reasons down. My partner asked how were we to drink our waters and that we were told once seated and received our drinks and food we could remove masks. He said that we must drink our water and then return our masks. Now I want to explain that this was in the 1st 10-15 minutes at most within this restaurant. Yet, upon arrival, during this interaction and within the interior of the restaurant, this rule did not apply to everyone. We saw non-compliance happening with the staff, hostess, and chef as they greeted people and even hugged people with out masks that they apparently knew. These customers had not been served food yet and also only had drinks and/or water. But, we listened to the manager, put on our masks between sips of water, at our outside table,  and waited to order our food and drinks. The menu is a twist on Southern cuisine and had selections like Gizzards and Dirty Rice, Gumbo, Catfish and collard greens. Food options are by plate size, small or large. And the sides are a la carte and presented as an option to have as a shareable appetizer. They have a wine menu to pair with the food. We had the shrimp and grits and salmon and corn entrees with a side of cornbread. We ordered two cocktails. The food was tasty.  The mini, and yes I said mini,  cocktails were cute and delicious, but small. Overall the food was tasty, was it fantastic- NO. For the price, it is expected for Hyde Park restaurants. The service and inconsistency with the guidelines is my biggest takeaway. We asked the host if she could take a picture of us at the table at a safe distance. Because it was a nice evening. She replied, only if we put on our masks. We thanked her and said never mind. Remember I said earlier I saw her speak with guests leaving and coming into the restaurant without their masks on and stood in very close proximity to her. After observing all of these things, we explained our concerns to our waiter and asked for the manager.  By this time we were turned off, and we were no longer hungry and picked at our food as we continued to observe staff interacting with customers without masks. The gentleman that came to our table earlier revealed he was the manager. This time he did not ask us to place our masks on before  he explained that he heard our concerns  and apologized. He explained that one of the guest at a nearby table was an old friend and that the staff was excited to see him. We explained that may be, but there were other occurrences of it happening and that within our 1st few minutes and throughout the evening we had been approached and reminded to mask up. So to see the staff blatantly bend the rules when they wanted was disappointing. We asked for our check soon after this conversation since we were dissatisfied with the experience. Our final straw was that the staff lingered at the host station as we left and did not thank us for coming to the restaurant. Needless to say we will not return.",

That's just a tip if you are looking for something more private cause outdoors with people constantly walking by and loud cars..anyway that didn't take away from the restaurant.

That was kind of a put off, but whatever, no big deal I guess. I ordered the shrimp and grits, honey butter cornbread, and mac n cheese. The shrimp left much to be desired, they tasted quite fishy and cheap (best way to describe). Like those mini shrimps you'd buy somewhere like Aldi or something. The grits were cooked correctly though. That cornbread is the devil! Omg so good as well as the mac. For the price of the cocktails I'd expect a standard sized drink and not a kiddie cocktail, which is exactly what they serve you (I see what you all did there). The ambiance was nice and the music was good. Fine dining and/or upscale is not what this establishment is, but I'll give it 3 stars for my overall experience, I may visit again.",

Good service, good food, great music, and a comfortable atmosphere. The decor is beautiful! I went for the first time on Sunday. I ordered the shrimp and geechie boy cheddar grits with a side of biscuits. The biscuits were brought out first and they were so good! The butter and preserve that's served with it made a great addition. As for the shrimp and grits, the shrimp were large and plentiful and the grits were nice and creamy! It didn't have any overwhelming sauce that many places smother onto their shrimp and grits, which I LOVED! For drinks, I ordered 1 mimosa and 1 bellini. They were okay, will try the Bloody Southerner next time. All together my bill was $47...those darn drinks lol. But this place is pricey in general...almost all of the side items are $6, which I don't agree with. Eggs or a single sausage patty should not cost $6.  Update from today\u2019s visit 7/23 \u2014 I ordered the shrimp and grits again today and unfortunately was highly disappointed. It was like it was a completely different dish! The grits were no longer creamy, they were runny. I didn\u2019t like the sauce used in the dish and it had an unfitting spiciness to it. It didn\u2019t even LOOK appealing. I also ordered the honey butter cornbread, which was the only thing I enjoyed. It\u2019s amazing. Get that. I doubt they\u2019ll risk compromising that recipe, everyone orders it.",

Our party was very impressed with the ambiance and exceptional customer service.  The other patrons consisted of various cultures and a wide range of ages.  The wait staff served our meals as a team, meaning all courses were brought to our table hot and at the same time.  Our only surprise was the cost and portion size of each menu item, still we were exceptionally happy to support Erik and pray that Virtue will offer more lower priced/special menu items, maybe on a certain day and time and I will definitely frequent often .",

Mind you it\u2019s not the usual pork gravy, but it\u2019s smoked turkey gravy. The chicken sausage was both sweet and savory. The cinnamon roll icing had a taste of sour cream and made it so tsty! All YUM! And the Bloody Virtue made this place, now, as my go-to spot for Bloody Mary!  Service was excellent, too. They were all very attentive. Water and coffee were never empty long and all were happy to help rather than the usual \u201cnot my table\u201d attitude.  Only minor con is that it was quite noisy in here with the music being a bit loud (but I know it\u2019s to drown out the conversations of the patrons due to the acoustic of the room). Not enough to dock even half a star, since my wife and I can hear each other no problem.",

He needed a different system for taking our orders as he was scrambling through 3 different sheets of paper trying to figure out what he wrote down and ended up missing several food items. Then he sent the manager to kick our group out because we were past time for the table, but the only reason we were still sitting there was because we were waiting on the dessert the server said was coming out. I would\u2019ve preferred to just have the young man who seemed to be going through training with the server as he was much friendlier with clearly some prior experience in dining.

It's free and the dining room is tight with little hanging space. We had the cinnamon roll and coffee cake to start. Cinnamon roll was delicious, icing not overly sweet, coffee cake was warm in the middle. This was the Sunday after Valentine's day, so my girl had a mimosa and I had the Bloody Mary. The Mary has hot sauce and Cajun kind of spices in it. Unique and good. I had the brioche and ham for my main course and she had the biscuits and gravy. The ham brioche is out of this world and the gravy had shredded smoked turkey in it. We'll definitely be back.",

Cocktails were great, refreshing and strong (I highly recommend Justify and Georgia Peach). For food, a couple of us got appetizers (called small rations on the menu) and a couple got entrees. The appetizers are great for sharing but can be enough as a small dinner entree. Everything we tried--the gumbo, green tomatoes, pork chop (huge!), and short ribs (so tender!) were cooked perfectly and presented beautifully.  Service was warm and friendly, and I appreciated that they brought everything out at the same time for us. The ambiance is elevated but still has a local neighborhood feel to it, and the decor feels both rustic and posh. Virtue is truly a gem in Hyde Park and I'll be back for more!",

As we were going to our table, the lady seating states.....we have a party that reserved this table at 8, and then asked her does that mean we have to leave by 8, she says yes.....I have never been to a restaurant that tells people you can have your table for 2 hours......I than asked the manager because I have been to the top restaurants in chicago, never heard such a thing. The manager in his words states \"because we want to give everyone  the best experience we feel that 2 hours is enough time for everyone to eat and enjoy-mind you it took the waitress 30min. to come with our drinks-, he then reinstated we have a party at 8 which reserved this table, I then stated so are you telling me we only had 2 hours to eat and socialize. I COULD NOT BELEIVE A RESTAURANT COULD TELL SOMEONE YOU HAVE 2 hours and then you must leave for the next party, by this time me and my friends felt they did not need our money, we paid for our drink, they double charged us then told us we were short, even though everyone had there individual bill, and I personally gave the waitress a bigger tip because we were leaving.......we ended up going to Mesler, had a blast, and when I asked the waitress at Mesler was there a 2 hour limit she looked at me like I was crazy and stated \"no mam we would never make someone get up after they have sat down.\"..... The food at virtue is amazing, however telling people they have 2 hours to eat is very disrespectful.",

I'm somewhat of a Chef myself so, I must say the food keeps me going back. Just call me the female Anton Ego, for those of you who has seen the movie Ratatouille. Anyway, like I said the food is devine. The service is pretty good, I hope it stays that way. But, the front where the Hostesses are when you first enter, to me sort of unprofessional. It was my daughter's birthday and she really wanted to go because I had hyped it up so much!!! But the hostess, who did not smile when she saw us enter. She was polite, however letting us know that there was a 7:15 reservation, and we would have to be quick about our eating. This bothered me so bad and kind of messed up my daughter's birthday and her first experience there. The manager, Jesus came to our table to speak with us about the problem that I had with the hostess. He apologized, but they really need to watch that. They don't know who a person is, or who they know. I really am taken back by that, so not too sure I'll go back, but we'll see",

The Wait Staff is extraordinarily pleasant and competent. The Food is both  wonderful and plentiful. My Companion had the Chicken and Waffles and he, as a Native of Mississippi, was delighted. I, Northern City Boy to the Core but born of Southern Parents, had the Shrimp, Cheese Grits, and Egg; they were among the Best that I have ever had. The Ambience of the Rooms was quite balanced; there was Little Noise from Other Customers' Tables. My Guest and I even had an Opportunity to meet . the Owner, Mr. Williams, a Highly Personable Man. My Only Complaint--and it is a Small One--is that the Restaurant is just a bit pricey. Oh, well. One cannot have everything. I highly recommend Virtue Restaurant to one and all. You will enjoy it.

We started our dinner with fried green tomatoes served with shrimp, which we all agreed were delicious. We also shared two orders of biscuits and cornbread with pimento cheese. The biscuits are really fabulous, drizzled with a little honey and served with soft butter. Yum. I ordered salmon and our friends had the catfish and a steak special.

One of the first things we noticed as we were seated, besides the super-modern, comfortable decor was that the open kitchen was in the same room as us.  Super-friendly staff beginning with the beautiful women who greeted us, the gentleman who poured our water, to Taylor, our ever-attentive & knowledgeable server!  Her recommendations certainly helped to make our culinary journey one to remember: from the \"gem lettuce\" & \"green tomatoes\"(& shrimp) appetizer, to the salmon, beef short ribs & pork chop entrees, then \"millie's puddin' (banana) & warm peach cobbler for dessert...whew!!  Our tummies are full of great food, we enjoyed great conversation in a very inviting (& busy) space. Thank you Virtue family for taking such great care of us tonight...CHEERS!",

The piece of salmon for the $27 approx price tag was small. I had to send my drink back because it was bitter instead of sweet. I ordered the southern summer. It has agave in it but I couldn't taste any. My replacement drink was fine. My daughters plate had plenty of chicken but was also lacking on a decent ratio of veggies. We ordered a side of cornbread and greens. Too many stems in the greens and the cornbread was dense and hard. It reheated better than it was served hot out of the oven. (Tip... serve the butter on the side) All and all..... $100 bill later.... will I return..  maybe if I was meeting friends.  I was disappointed on some levels and pleased on others. My waiter was Tahar and he was awesome. I made sure to tip him well for such wonderful service. Also... a tip for the owner... dont chew out your wait staff in the middle of the night. It affects them mentally and makes it hard to work and serve with a pleasant demeanor.  Also... I should not have been privy to watch it go down.",

The beets were OK\u2026 it's cold, I prefer warm beets\u2026 the half chicken, corn bread and cauliflower were all very delicious. The chicken esp was very juicy. The slightly sweet sides of squash and tomato relish suited the chicken spice well. The atmosphere is classy yet relaxing.

        "caption": "Virtue was an absolutely gorgeous restaurant with a spacious and well-appointed interior that takes nearly every point of contemporary dining and executed it flawlessly.  The mixture of china your grandmother may have used with a modernist bowl offsetting it and beautiful tones of grey, white and beige, subway tiles and stainless steel make it a truly beautiful space almost equally divided between the bar salon and the main dining room.  It is full of light and full of class with comfortable seating and an open kitchen.  The hours on the front should be updated to reflect brunch service which is the meal I chose for dining.  Judging by how quickly the dining room filled, it is a place where folks want to be seen dining as the crowd was diverse and everyone looked quite fashionable.  Virtue is clearly a place with great potential but it runs the risk of forgetting what is most important in a dining space, the food must be executed well and taste great in order to sustain its growth and popularity.  Now begins the critical part, as wonderful a space as this restaurant presents, the food and preparation are where it needs the most improvement.  These are the not-so-hard questions I had to ask myself...how do you overcook a waffle in a \"chicken and waffle\" dish and not prepare another one and do nothing to make it pop, no garnish, no sauce just a piece of chicken plopped on an overdone waffle?  How do you have \"tortillas and pork\" which lists cheddar cheese as an important ingredient but you do not melt the cheese properly?   The best item I ordered was the crunchy french toast with the banana pudding, banana slices and nilla wafer crumble which was plated nicely and almost as decadent as a dessert for breakfast.  The rescue of the tortillas and pork with a biscuits and salmon dish helped make a recovery.  The server was informative and helped to balance our rocky table, she was clearly experienced and attentive.  The restrooms are also nice with pocket doors and a gorgeous image of the Queen of Soul.   My last pet peeve was the blaring of the gospel music just a tad bit too high.  With many hard surfaces it can take away from the meal and should be ambient and complementary not cacophonic.",

Some friends and I had an 8:30 reservation we were 10min early waited 20min to be seated another 30min to eat. Other customers who came after us were seated given drinks laughing enjoying their meal. If not for my girlfriend and my friends who accompanied us I would have left. Our waitress admitted she was new but... her poor service was not an excuse. I did speak with the manager who  offered his apologies and extended 2 complimentary desserts that he chose but, we  didn't care for. On a positive note the food was delicious.... THAT, they got right! Would I go back undecided. I have a hard time paying for bad service, regardless to how good the meal was. 2 stars is all I got but.... that chef gets 5.",

You walk out being surprised how little you paid for a good meal. One of the popular wines, horseshoes and handgrenades, is off menu but fabulous. Some of the dishes are excellent: the mushrooms; the shrimp and grits; the beef short ribs. Others are simply fine, like the broccoli, squash, or catfish. The sides (mac and cheese, collard greens) manage to be disappointing in the same way that so many BBQ joint sides are disappointing.

The staff was professional and pleasant. Our server was funny and made us feel welcome and relaxed.  The interior is very nice, well designed and not pretentious! The menu was very good. I had the fried green tomatoes. They were excellent! My entree was a wild mushroom dish, cooked perfectly.  The cocktails we're ok. The menu doesn't accurately list all ingredients and I ended up with a very sweet cocktail when I was hoping for one without sugar added.  The issues I had that kept me from 5 stars was the cocktail menu being unclear and missing ingredients, that I was brought the wrong cocktail initially (but still charged for it), and the fried green tomatoes we're ridiculously hot and burned my mouth, leaving it sore for a week! I'll be back definitely, and I hope they can iron out those tiny wrinkles! Definitely try this place, especially for a post-9pm dinner. I wasn't disappointed.",

There's about 12 seats at the bar and 12 or so tables. The bar stayed pretty full throughout the evening but there was a steady flow in and out so there weren't a lot of people standing.  The folks working behind the bar were great and the service was what you'd hope for in a place like this. Michael was knowledgable, willing to make recommendations, and willing to chat and check in even as he was busy making drinks.  They had four seasonal cocktails on their menu and 8-10 others. They also have a nice wine list and a solid beer list (maybe 5-6 on tap and another 6-8 in bottles).  I went with a cocktail - the Baby's It's Cold Outside (seasonal). It's the  perfect seasonal cocktail - the rum providing some nice sweetness and that slightly-boozy-warming vibe that you want from a seasonal drink and the almond liqueur provides those earthy-warming-sitting-by-a-fire notes. A really nice drink.  I'll definitely be back. Can't wait to eat dinner here.  Edit: Came back for dinner Feb 2019. Loved it. Amazing food and great attentive service. A must do experience in the neighborhood.",

The pork chop is a very generous serving and delicious - the apple based sauce is the perfect touch to the pork. The broccoli is a great vegetable starter. And the Mac and cheese was ... greatness in cheddar cheesiness!  We walked in on a Thursday evening and waS seated right away in the bar area. The service was a touch slow, but friendly.",

On the okay side: *The chile-like chicken gumbo tasted OK\u2014it could\u2019ve used more rice. The chicken was chewy. *The 1/2 chicken with collards was OK the greens were flavorfully seasoned the chicken was unremarkable. *The seasonal eggnog cocktail was disappointing because it was tiny and not cold.  I would think a $12 milk-based drink would be cold or on ice.  The water wasn\u2019t cold either.  Come to think of it I didn\u2019t see ice anywhere in the place. *The pecan tart with pear slices was ok.
