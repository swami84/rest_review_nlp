This was my first time trying Burmese food, so it could very well be that I went in with the wrong expectations... But I was left a bit underwhelmed. Nothing was inedible, but everything seemed like it could have used more flavor. On top of that, our order was missing the dessert item. When I called the restaurant to ask about the missing item, no one answered, even though it was only 5 minutes after closing. Kind of a bummer experience overall.",

We thought the pricing for the Thamee Lay was off - you only get a small noodle dish, even though the pricing of the large noodles were much more in line with the mains. Our server's response was that it was the goal to not be so full? Made no sense to us. We ended up ordering several Lays and just ordered the Mohinga by itself. Our starters included spicy shoots & greens, lahpet thoke, and chicken/white flower mushroom, which we ordered with a side of garlic naan. The starters were pretty much all delicious. The lahpet thoke was my least favorite - it had an interesting flavoring of sourness with the bitterness of the tea leaves. Their garlic naan is so so yummy! The Mohinga was really delicious, hearty but not heavy curry broth with perfectly cooked noodles. We tried all 3 of the mains. The pazun hin's prawns were cooked so tender. The curried meatballs, while the curry sauce was really delicious, the meatballs were on the dry side. This curry sauce tastes delicious with the golden rice and dipping naan! Ma Jo's spicy tofu was just weird to us. It wasn't terrible but the taste was \"why bother eating this, why bother making this\". May have just been personal preference at our table. Our server was very kind and offered us another dish to replace it since we weren't fond of it, but we were already full and appreciatively declined the offer. We finished with the kulfi affogato which sounded so interesting on the menu, but was just ok - wouldn't order it if there were more creative dessert choices. Our server made our dinner a great experience, checked in with us consistently and really spoke to the food and elements.",

        "caption": "Now that Thamee has been open for a few months, I was invited back to experience it again and wow. I am so glad I gave it another chance. The co-owners' mission is to normalize Burmese food in the USA. With food as tasty as at Thamee, mission accomplished. Thamee is worth a try, even if it feels outside of your comfort zone. Here's why:  1) Space: It feels like home. The staff from the chef to the co-owner to the bartenders all treat each other and you like family. It's the warmest entrance you'll have at a DC restaurant and it doesn't end throughout your visit.  2) Food: It is really good. There are a few items that may make your head turn like the wontons with chicken gizzards, but every single item (including the gizzards) are excellent. The stand outs- the green tea salad is full of flavor and better than any salad I've had at a Burmese restaurant (If you like Burma Superstar in San Francisco, Thamee's salad is better), the tofu (wow- best tofu we've had. It's made from chickpeas and soy-free), curry beef meatballs, and the kulfi affogato. Most items we will craze sending us back to Thamee time and time again.  3) Drinks: Okay, the cocktails surprised us. They recently released their fall cocktail menu and it's on point. We had six of the eight drinks. Each one complimented the food well. Each drink is among the best and most creative we've had in D.C., but the winner was the Ayu Ma with coconut oil-washed mezcal, banana liqueur, rhubarb amaro, cilantro-lemongrass syrup, orange bitters, and egg white. I don't love mezcal and my wife doesn't like banana, but we both LOVED this drink. All their drinks bridge the gap between more stiff and sweet drinks. No matter your preference, you'll LOVE their drinks.  We're soooo glad we went back. Thamee just became our regular spot.  If you want unique, fine dining in an accessible environment, come to Thamee and stay awhile! ____________________________________________________________________ Thamee is the new Burmese restaurant that replaced my favorite restaurant in DC, Sally's Middle Name. If you were a fan of its predecessor, you'll recognize the space. The new owners did very little to change the space, which I appreciate.  Thamee is from the creators behind Toli Moli in Union Market (I love Toli Moli and their buns!). The owners have a personal connection to Burma and tell an incredible story. They want to introduce quality Burmese food to Washington, D.C. To do that, they invest time and energy in gathering the very best ingredients for their dishes.  That said, I left unimpressed with the food. With media attention, I thought Thamee would be one of the best meals I'll have in the city. That wasn't the case. Now I am wondering if I don't like Burmese food or if they could do a better job on the food. I want to think its the latter.  I ordered the white mushroom and chicken dish, which was good, but not life-changing. The prawn and tomato dish was decent. The meeshay was GREAT and my favorite dish.  What was odd was that we ordered the eggplant and cauliflower curry. It came out with no cauliflower, very little eggplant and TONS of tomatoes. We asked the server about it and he said they messed up. He brought a new dish with some cauliflower, but still with an overload of tomatoes. I love a good tomato, but the description on the menu doesn't mention tomatoes. For dominating the dish, I was surprised by that.  The drinks were just okay and the service, sadly, not good. We sat at the bar on a Monday (they close Tuesday since most restaurants close Monday- smart move) and it took about 20 minutes for the server to notice us. Once he did, he disappeared for another 20 minutes. Our entire experience lasted 2.5 hours because our server was so inattentive. What made up for it was the owner. She is a true delight and someone you'd want to hang out with!  I definitely want to go back, because I want to love Thamee, but my first experience was a 3-star one.",

Two experience menus for two people was a TON of food, I had enough for dinner the next night. I'd recommend a la carte.  My date and I did the experience menu including the cocktails for $55 each. We did the Shrimp + Buthee fritters, Gin Those, Pork + Picked Mango Curry with Golden Rice, the Dan Bauk Chicken, White flower mushroom + chicken, and the Mohinga plus the sorbet.  The fritters were good but the Dan Bauk Chicken could have been great but it was severely undercooked. I showed the server and she winced at how underdone it was. She offered to cook up another order so I could take it to-go, but one underdone chicken was enough for me (no offer or drinks or a discount)...my date's favorite was the pork + pickled mango curry. I didn't really have a favorite.  The tables are also really unstable so watch out!  Overall the place has a great vibe, the food could be improved, but I'm all for supporting a woman owned minority business, so check it out! I'd for sure go back for drinks and an appetizer.",

I wish I had gotten x5 of them rather then splitting one amongst the three of us.  The fiancee got the chicken coconut curry and she loved it. I tried the sauce (as I am vegetarian) and for me it was a little too sweet but I guess I am a bit more critical of food. It's also important to note I only tried the sauce, not the dish as a whole with the noodles, chicken, and onions.  BFF got prawns and tomatoes. Didn't want to try but she loved it and had a very satisfied food face.  I got the cauliflower and eggplant. One of two main vegetarian dishes. TBH it sucked. The eggplants were not cooked equally, some crunchy and some rubbery. The dish itself lacked seasoning and mostly tasted like tomatoes. I love tomatoes but it doesn't serve as enough flavor for the dish. In addition, it took around 7 minutes between when my fiancee and BFF got their dish and when I got my dish. They were half way done by the time mine arrived. This is why I felt forced to lower the stars.  We ended the meal with one plate of the dessert of the day. I enjoyed it but i wish the bread was bigger. But my god, that buttery naan was yummy. Ice cream was quite interesting.",

We ordered the tea leaf salad, coconut curry with mushroom, cauliflower & pickled mango, and the palata & scoops. I highly recommend all of them! Would love to come back for brunch. As a note - you may have to verify if certain dishes are vegan even if they're labeled that way on the menu (ex. the coconut curry comes with egg). I only wish that there was a vegetarian version of the tea leaf salad :)",

The staff seemed to all be really invested in ensuring we had a positive experience.  They also have a decent sized bar with some fun looking cocktails.

        "caption": "My friend and I were very excited to try Burmese food but unfortunately we left hungry, underwhelmed and unhappy. We paid $60 each for the tasting menu and all we got were 2 appetizers, 1 main dish and 1 dessert to share. For $120 we could have gotten at least 6 dishes from their regular menu and would probably be much happier. I have done tasting menus countless times and they usually have 5-6 dishes so we were very surprised when they offered to bring dessert next. When we brought up the fact that we at least expected a dessert each, they did give us a second one but the manager (or owner) didn\u2019t seem pleased. The staff were amazing and would give 5 stars for them but I cannot in good conscience give more than 2 stars to this place based on portions and taste.",
