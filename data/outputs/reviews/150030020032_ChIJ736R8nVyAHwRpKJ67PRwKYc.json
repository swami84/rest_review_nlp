The three things that I am extremely picky about are (A.) dumplings (B.) ramen and (C.) sponge cakes. So you know when I say it's good, it should be pretty reliable. First of all, the noodles did not disappoint. It didn't taste like the package noodles, but rather the hand pulled ones. Because of the thickness, it kinda reminds me of the Northern hand pulled noodles. I ordered the cold noodles because of the weather and also cause the noodle wouldn't get soggy so quickly. The broth is a bit tangy than I like but it's perfect for this heat. It's less filling that way.  Finally, the pork was flavorful and tender. Overall, I think this bowl of ramen is better than any ramen I had in Tokyo. I will try the traditional broth ramen next time when I return to Hawaii. . P.S. be prepared to drink a gallon of water afterward. It WILL make you super thirsty after.  price: $15 USD (CASH ONLY) taste: 3.8 / 5 atmosphere: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f seating: \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Price Performance ratio: 3.8 / 5",

We weren't super hungry so we didn't mind the wait. We wrote our names down on the wait list and waited around 10 minutes.  Things to note: Cash Only and no take-out.  There isn't a variety of broths offered. It's mainly just tonkotsu. We ordered fried chicken and 2 bowls of regular egg ramen.  Fried chicken was juicy and tasted pretty good -4/5  Ramen: broth was thick and had a rich flavor. But I just thought it was a bit too oily for me. I added some fresh garlic and spicy powder that was tasty and not too spicy. I wasn't a fan of the thick noodles and prefer thin noodles, but that's my preference. The pork chashu was sliced thick and was really good. However, 2 out of the 3 slices I had were mainly fat, so I didnt eat my last slice because it was just too rich. My husband though had nice meaty slices in his bowl. He really loved the bowl of ramen he received.  Because we weren't super hungry, we couldn't finish all the fried chicken and I didn't finish my bowl. I couldn't take it to-go to eat it at my hotel. Overall I give this place 3 stars for both food and experience.",

The broth is really nice, and full of flavor. The biggest surprise was the noodles. They are very, very thick. For me, they were actually too thick. Even so, the broth was still able to cling to the noodles, and make it enjoyable. The pork was good, with a nice amount of fat. Overall, it was a decent bowl of ramen. Worth trying.",

One of them is Ramen Balio's branch, which has its head office in Nihonbashi.  Order this from the menu.  TSUKEMEN Fresh noodle $ 13.98 (tax, insert the tip, around 1,850 yen)  Noodles are in a row with REGULAR. There is also LARGE for + $ 1.5, so if you can eat well, please go there.  It is a pork broth with plenty of back oil, but it is not as stiff as it looks, and it is surprisingly easy.  It is easy to eat thick cut pork with a kitchen knife.  Hot taste seasoning is included by default.  And how to eat ramen in front of you! Is written in various ways. First of all, if you add garlic and special chili pepper from the middle, it will be quite impressive.  After eating the noodles and looking at the pickled juice, it turned red and sweat was coming out.

The soup is too oily which covers the original taste of pork. There are so many great ramen places in Honolulu but this one is definitely not one of them. 3.Overpriced.

        "caption": "I would like to start by saying that I know ramen well. We spent 2 weeks in Japan mostly eating ramen. It is also our comfort food at home and we live in a city with fantastic ramen options.  This ramen is not good. The broth has almost no flavor and this is the core of a good ramen. It doesn't taste like it was cooked for many hours like it's supposed to be.  The broth is also overly fatty with lots of visible fat floating in the broth which isnt very appetizing to see. It is amazing that even with this much fat they managed to get almost no flavour into the broth. The meat had an odd flavour that it really shouldn't have from the marinade that they use and is mostly fat (almost no actual meat). If this was cheap fast ramen I might let it slip and give it a 3 but it's expensive for what it is and isnt good. I left more than half of my bowl because I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. If you want good ramen please go elsewhere, there are much better options in Waikiki.",

        "caption": "The dipping ramen is probably the best ramen I've had outside of Japan. The acidic vinegar base of the soup cuts through the fattiness of the meat, and really stimulates your appetite. The noodles are also springy and perfectly sized, pushing me to get a second order of just the noodles. The sprouts provided a delightful crunch, a fantastic counterbalance to the noodles. The house spice was also pleasantly hot, yet not so much as to overwhelm the palate.  So why only three stars?  First is the traditional ramen (soy based broth with the noodles in the broth) that others in my party had gotten. The broth was so overly salty and fatty that it was virtually inedible. Later we noticed that some around us had ordered the traditional ramen with 50% salt, something that I strongly STRONGLY suggest. However, that still doesn't address the fattiness of the broth (yes I know ramen broth is often thicker and richer, but this was to an extreme)  That leads into point number two, which was the chashu. Traditionally, the chashu is beautiful layers of fat with lean meat. However, the monstrosities in ALL of our bowls was all fat (you can see it in the picture). All that gristle was what made the traditional ramen unbearably fatty. It was only tolerable in the dipping ramen because it was cut through by the vinegar base broth.  Third was the ajitsuke tamago (or ramen egg). This was absolutely nothing like fantastically gooey and delectable eggs that I had in Japan. They seemed almost like de-shelled hard boiled eggs that were dropped into the soup right beforehand.  It's too bad, because I badly want to go back again for that incredible dipping ramen.",

It's crunchy and has a lot of fat, so you may have different tastes, but I think it's the best. You should definitely add garlic! We also recommend special peppers! Eat it exactly as it is written, and then do whatever you like. The smell of garlic remains quite a bit. .. ..  I would like to visit the Shinbashi main store as well.

It comes with vegetables and tender pork piled on top, and the noodles and broth are just phenomenal!  It\u2019s in the basement of a high-rise, and mixed up between a bunch of other Japanese themed restaurants, but don\u2019t miss it because it was wonderful food.  I loaded mine up with their Ramen sauce (a soy based dark sauce), and hot peppers (hot hot hot!).  It was good as it was served, and phenomenal after I spiced it up.  I hear the \u201cdipping noodle\u201d is too heavy - I don\u2019t know as I didn\u2019t try it.  The basic Ramen is the way to go!  I usually go to Ramen Nakamura, but it\u2019s too fancy for my kids.  This place was a great alternative.  They had a high chair for my littlest, and didn\u2019t mind the mess they made (kids and Ramen...).  Highly recommend!",

Their prices range from about 12-19 dollars for ramen. They have a few appetizers also. Their noodles used in their ramen are super thick, about halfway from a normal ramen noodle to a udon noodle. Their noodles are al dente which makes it delicious. Their broth is rich and yummy. They add cabbage and the broth is pretty garlicy. They have two sizes: regular and large. Their regular is busting with noodles and other things. It was huge and I couldn\u2019t even finish it! Also, they are super friendly! Overall, a really good ramen place.",
