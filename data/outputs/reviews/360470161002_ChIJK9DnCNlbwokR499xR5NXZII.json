I called back because someone (probably Ted) canceled my reservation for me and I wanted to know if I would still be charged. The manager, Amir, answered this time and he was just as unaccommodating and rude! I will never be returning to this restaurant and I will be sure that none of my friends do as well.

It was a cold night, my friend and I were seated at the opening to the patio which does not have sufficient plastic covering-plenty of ventilation even if the plastic were extended-and was unbearably uncomfortable.  I made the huge mistake of asking if we could move to neighboring table after  the other diners had departed.   They suggested that we place a chair on the other side of our tiny table, which would break the 6 ft. distancing rule.  I was not comfortable with being so close to other diners and again asked if we could have the other table.   Such a small request became such a big deal.  The server didn't want to do it because other diners were scheduled for the table, and we would have to wait for an answer- he seemed very uncomfortable.   I asked the hostess and she gave us attitude.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, I asked the server again, as the couple had departed, in a nasty tone he said he didn't know and it wasn't up to him. He then turned his back on me.  The hostess finally came back out and started moving us to the other table without a word.  Rude.   Upon her departure, she said that if we want a warmer table in the future, then request it on Resy.  I don't think we need to worry about that, and how would I have known that it would be so uncomfortable in that spot.. For the remainder of the evening our server was unfriendly and distant.  I sent a message through Resy thinking that the owners would be interested in how their customers are being treated over such a small request, but never received a response.  I see that the attitude must come from the top-down.  This is such a shame, as the food is very good.   I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant, I can't imagine how things would be if it were something unreasonable.   Sofreh needs to be reminded that it is in the business of hospitality!",

Sofreh can be described as \"dressed-up Persian cuisine\" with the chef's unique take on classic dishes like Potatoe Pancake (Kookoo seebzameeni), Smoked Eggplant (mirzah ghasemi) and new dishes that you won't typically find at a Persian restaurant like the cauliflower starter with the chili glaze and shallot yogurt and their catch-of-the-day fish immersed in a traditional herb and tamarind stew (ushe torsh) which is usually a heavy vegetarian stew eaten alone as a soup. Four stars here as they are stingy with portions and have a strict \"one tahdig per table policy\"...isn't tahdig 90% of the reason one goes to a Persian restaurant? It's not your Friday night homey Shabbat Persian meal that has you looking for the nearest couch to recline on, but a more refined Saturday night version that keeps the dishes and portion light enough to keep the night going.",

Then the waitress brought a check without us requesting it. Shortly after the manager came and asked us to leave as he has a party waiting for a table. We were not informed that we had a time slot. We put our cards on the table and waited for a waitress to pick it up. Then the manager visibly stressed came back and said we had to leave as he had another party waiting for the table. We left disappointed after paying $100 a person, I came to the manager and expressed my disappointment with this treatment and said he was impolite. Nowhere in NYC I experienced being asked to leave. He replied that 1.5h is enough to have a meal and maybe I should go more places to see as this is how it goes. The worst was that when I was taking my bike I saw that no one was waiting for our table standing, but 1 party just wanted to switch table from the front yard to the backyard... Rude, arrogant service. Won\u2019t ever go back there. And I am well rounded world traveler - I know how it goes.",

The outdoor space out back is adorable, beautiful, and the perfect dining ambience. Service is incredibly well-coordinated and it felt like the dishes came seamlessly as the previous course was cleared. The owner/chef even came by our table to greet us - she's TRULY the most genuine host and best storyteller. Treat yourself to some of the best food that NYC has to offer and stop by Sofreh.

Everything looked incredible and we couldn't make up our minds so we just ordered a ton of food knowing we'd have leftovers to go. We began with the eggplant & whey dip, roasted cauliflower, herb kofteh, and the feta & herb flatbread. Next up was the half chicken, mejdool date & lentil rice, and a side of tahdig. And to round out the night, we got the rose custard. Each dish was fantastic! If I had to choose a couple of favorites, they would be the roasted cauliflower and the rose custard. The service was also attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was enjoyable. Oh, and the leftovers held up well so we got to enjoy the night all over again. Too bad it's a schlep for us to get here from upper Manhattan. Still, we'll make an effort to get back before too long because there are so many other dishes to try!",

I've eaten around the world and cook a lot myself and yet was surprised by many of the flavors in the food we ordered. Prices can seem high but the servings are quite generous and some of the dishes (like the amazing duck) are more than enough for two people to share.",

The Persian herb stew with lentils was a blend of perfect seasoning and was only outdone by the duck entre which comes with a side of duck (breast with a side of dark meat!). You should get a side of rice to complete your meal, and dabble in the unique cocktail list. Overall, may be one of the best dinner restaurants in Brooklyn.",

We love Persian food but haven't quite found an authentic experience where you can eat Persian foods that taste like they're made at home. Sofreh delivered this beautifully! The menu was so perfectly constructed to capture the essence of Persian culture and the flavors melded together very nicely. The chef introduces unique flavors like tahini, tamarind and chili so effortlessly and though these are not traditional \"Persian flavors\" they compliment the dishes very well. She even stopped by our table and gave us lots of interesting insight into the construction of the menu and inspiration for the unique new flavors. The classic dishes like the herb and beef stew (ghorme sabzi) and the bean and noodle soup (aash reshte) were executed to perfection. Even the more simple appetizers like the freshly made barbari bread with feta spread and the Shirazi salad were full of flavor. We really enjoyed our experience and will definitely be going back!",

Dips were great (which the bread had been hot, pillowy as it appears but perhaps they pre-bake for the 6 pm crowd) - highly recommend having the smoky eggplant main as an appetizer. It was lovely. The kebab was a true highlight - superb. Enjoyed the rum and bourbon cocktails, the ice cream was lovely.",

And for all that, I sincerely thank Nasim, Amir, and the rest of the team for making it happen. I have been waiting for so long for a place just like Sofreh in the US. You can\u2019t even find such a gem in LA that\u2019s the Iranian hub of the US.  As for drinks, we truly enjoyed Bahar Bitter, Saffron Drink, and Sekanjebin Martini. We were surprised by a special shot of a Greek digestif, Mastika at the end - on the house.  We started with a selection of appetizers, the feta, herbs and flatbread, the meatball, and the potato pancake. My favorite was the flatbread, it tasted delicious and was a modern representation of the most iconic snack back home. The meatball was a delight with a tasty gravy and the prune and walnut in the center of it.  The mains were just as delightful, carrot rice along with Ghormesabzi, Lamb Shank, and Pomegranate rib-eye. We enjoyed every bite. Don\u2019t forget to try the desserts, the Persian ice cream sandwich was as delicious as it was beautifully presented.  The team at Sofreh is creative and passionate, they\u2019re working hard to bring unique Persian flavors to us. As an Iranian, I can tell you that good Iranian food takes time to prepare So some patience may be required \ud83d\ude42. This was the best Persian food I\u2019ve had in 44 countries I have visited outside of Iran, only second to my mom\u2019s cooking.",

We started with the strained yogurt with shallots and chives as well as the herb kofteh (meatball).  Make sure to take some bread, put some meatball and sauce add yogurt and it makes for an incredible bite. We did order an extra bread.  Our main courses were: Striped bass catch of the day - without a doubt the best cooked fish dish I've ever had.  Rib eye kabob with pomegranate - cooked to perfection and every component worked together. Symphony in my mouth!  Saffron carrot and golden raisins rice  Burnt rice side  Pickles  All the dishes were seasoned perfectly. Nothing was over or under seasoned (even combined together).  Wrapped with the Persian sorbet.  What an experience and pricing was excellent for the quality of meal.",

We definitely felt racially profiled because we were the only ones of color sitting outside and on the property. We were told outside seating was for walk-ins and we were taken aback by how we were approached and treated.

I managed to get a reservation for three day of at prime dining hours which must have been a cancellation because it now seems impossible to find a table anytime before 9pm. I wish they used Resy rather than open table because you can have them notify you of cancellations. Anyway - the food was absolutely incredible, we all came super hungry and accustomed to New York portions ordered way too much, the app\u2019s are small-ish and extremely tasty (we had the eggplant, cauliflower, two of the salads) one serving of the orange rice was enough for the table, the mains are HUGE (or probably just the size they should be for $30+). We had the chicken, steak and lamb, all of which were delicious but the chicken in particular was unreal, best I\u2019ve ever tasted. We had to take quite a lot home because we over ordered but it was worth it. Yeah... we got dessert too (I don\u2019t know how/why), rice pudding and the ice cream which were both very nice, the ice cream in particular. If and when I can get another reservation my order would be; eggplant, date and tahini salad, orange rice, chicken, ice cream - split between 2. Oh I also forgot to mention the space is gorgeous and the graphic design of menus is really cool, all the staff were lovely and helpful with suggestions.",

The menu is concise which might leave some disappointed or at the very least surprised that such and such dish is omitted but Persian cuisine is of enormous depth and breadth and I suspect that it makes more business sense this way rather than try to cover as much ground as possible.  What you need to know is that whatever made it on the menu is perfectly executed and the food (with the exception of the desserts) is phenomenal and should preferably be shared and enjoyed family style.  From the appetizers we had the eggplant spread (!!), the yogurt and shallot drip and the kofteh. All were very good and enjoyed with extra servings of the Sofreh bread.  We also had the Tahini and date salad and quickly ordered another one as it was that delicious.  From the mains we had the half chicken, the lamb shank and the half duck. The chicken is an absolute must-get, the duck is also really good but the lamb I found good but not spectacular.  The desserts were the most disappointing part, we had the carrot halva and the ice cream, neither of which matched the tastiness of the previous dishes. Next time, I might just finish the meal here with a hot tea.  Finally the service although at times a bit slow, was friendly and pleasant.  Overall Sofreh lives up to the hype, is a reservation worth waiting for and I'll look forward to coming back and to bring my Persian friends here.",

It might be a creative idea to have a Persian restaurant that doesn\u2019t serve kabob but it\u2019s not a spiritual experience to be kicked out after spending $80 a person for way over hyped food that isn\u2019t supposed to be bougie in the first place. As an anthropologist and media studies of the middle east specialist I did adore the bathroom wall paper of old Iranian films but the attitude and lack of customer service from the owner and staff was not that of middle eastern style hospitality, manners or grace. I don\u2019t recommend visiting an establishment that makes you unwelcome and indebted to them! Super unprofessional, inappropriate and rude to scold us for their bad reservation policy and system!

The attention to color palette and plating is truly remarkable and the owner was lovely. I typically don\u2019t enjoy Iranian restaurants as much as food cooked at home because the decor is usually dark and old fashioned. The decor here was very bright, modern, and overall refreshing. Our waiter was excellent. There was also an amazing utilization of acidity in the food which I have not experienced in many other restaurants. I read some of the lower reviews of the restaurant and while I understand some may be displeased with the lack of some \u201ctraditional\u201d dishes on the menu, for me it is what made it stand out. The food was surprisingly not as rice centric as typical dishes but all the food was delicious, inspired, daring, and undeniably Persian.",

Sadly, the restaurant came close to ruining the celebration.  Our reservation was for 6:30 and we arrived on time. By 7:45, we had not received our entrees. We asked the waiter, who told us the food would be there \"in a couple of minutes,\" and when there was no sign of it ten minutes later we asked the manager. He proceeded to tell us that our reservation was \"during the rush from 6-7\" and \"the kitchen gets backed up,\" basically telling us to be patient without apologizing. ...Okay, so it's our fault for getting the only reservation that we could?  I'll admit that, when they came, the entrees were extraordinary. The smoked eggplant is rich and hearty, the bread that accompanies it is stunning, and the sauce accompanying the chicken is nuanced and complex. But the restaurant's poor response to our delayed food -- and the length of the delay in the first place -- spoiled the experience.  Appetizers also were disappointing. The cauliflower was well-seasoned and had great accompaniments on the plate, but $12 for three cauliflower florets is daft, even in Brooklyn. I liked the meatballs and the broth accompanying them, but my fianc\u00e9 thought the meat was dry (and other reviewers have said the same).  Skip the appetizers, enjoy the entrees, and maybe wait until they've ironed out the kinks before you go.",

The hosts and owners and service is really great and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxing and beautiful with white and wooden interior design. When it comes to the food, they have a small menu focusing on dishes from north and southern Iran!  Having an iranian background with a mother from north and a father from the south with excellent cooking skills I am well familiar with all the dishes, particularly the white fish dish. The dishes seems to be adapted to suite the western taste while looking aesthetically presentable, which is to be fully respected. The white fish dish was indeed created in such a manner, where as the fish was fried and placed on the sauce. This fish sauce being from the southern part of Iran is indeed supposed to be more spicy and cooked with the fish to give it the actual flavour. The sour cherry drink was also quite watered down and not much taste to it- it was more like thick paste mixed with the water. The lamb shack was well done and was a good portion in its traditional sauce, so worth a try. The rice however, was not as expected for both dishes, contrary to the great traditional rice cooking as per the iranian style. The broad bean rice had little flavour and in addition to the dill had another herb added to it which made the taste way too strong. The crispy rice was quite oily and almost burnt, so it was not as expected. Overall I can say it was a good attempt to present iranian traditional food to the unknown. So definitely worth a try for the adventurous foodie.",

My opening night meal of spicy white fish (spicy was more a slow burn than the fiery spice of other cuisines) sent me to text friends to come back with me the next night, and the owner remembered me from my friend's telling her my name! Appetizers of meatballs with cherries, lamb & lentil patties, and olive tapenade preceded equally excellent chicken with plum, saffron and barberries and slow cooked lambshank. The rosewater sorbet was a perfect finish. Wine is available, a crisp rose goes really well. This place is a must go.",

From my first bite of expertly seasoned lamb and salad to my last bite of saffron ice cream, I was truly in a culinary nirvana.
