This place has a great location, the Waikiki beach, sunset, people watching,  etc. We sat near the balcony to catch the sunset and we  each ordered appetizers. 1st was the garlic shrimp (5 med. Shrimp), 2nd was the Dim Sum, and 3rd was the Jelly Fish.  Dim sum was so- so. Jelly Fish was different and crunchy like a pickle but lighter in taste, and the Garlic shrimp was good and tasty , but not worth the price. Menu listings were pricey, for example the 1/2 of duck was  $60 (whole duck can be had for $20 all day at any decent Asian Restaurant in ), the Tomahawk steak $120, and that's about $25 at Sams club. I ordered the steak ( $60) and it's A La Carte, so rice was ordered as well. The steak was too sweet, must be the sweet soy sauce and it wasn't worth $60. I live on Florida's Gulf Coast and we have some great restaurants and I know my food. Why 1 star? It's this.  You are in a nice restaurant,  beautiful view of the beach and sunset, but about 150 feet from the balcony their is a Pavilion that becomes a haven for the  Urban campers, i.e. the Hlomeless. I know Hawaii is a liberal state and I saw two uniformed cops making rounds so it was SOP  for the Homeless to sleep there but with the mutual  understanding that they must vacate in the morning before the tourists. Well as I was in my 2nd bite of that sweet steak, a homeless woman goes towards the wall, hikes up her skirt,  and does a halfway squat and does her business right there * the Pavilion is lit up very bright*. I pointed that out to my companions and also looked at the reactions from other diners and it was as expected...disgust and disbelief. Keep in mind that she could have gone to the beach  and into the darkness. I mentioned what I saw to the waiter and he wasn't fazed by it at all. Again,  great view, So- So food that was way overpriced, but until the politicians do something about adequate housings for the homeless I wouldn't eat there. Morimoto   needs to retrain these Chefs and your name can only bring you a one time visit from the likes of me. As for all these 5 stars review... I'm shaking my head...right...",

Curry flour in Singapore curry flour was too effective and could not be eaten until the end. The idea may be good, but the skill of the creator is immature. The view from the deck is amazing.

The food really is only ok, the restaurant tries to have food from a lot of different Asian cuisines (hence Asia in the name) and every dish is done better by a restaurant that focuses on that one cuisine. People raved about the surf and turf roll, and it's not great. Kalbi was tender but the flavour was just kochujang. House fried rice was ok, but again didn't pack much flavour. Black cod was kind of good, but done better elsewhere.  As others have said, the service isn't that good either. I'm not a guy that needs the servers to appear instantly whenever I need them but basic things weren't done. We ordered the A5 Wagyu beef and didn't get a knife and fork. Eating The fried rice off large dishes with chopsticks is also awkward, they should probably give bowls with the dish. Also dishes that we finished didn't get cleared the whole meal. The men's bathroom had a single urinal that was pretty gross, but that's to be expected if 200 guests share that one urinal, they probably could've added a few more urinals, or they need someone to clean it constantly.  If your wallet is fat and expectations low, you can probably enjoy this place.",

The food was also very disappointing...it just wasn't that good.  This place is very expensive for what it is...Don't waste your money here!!!",

We loved loved food and menu when it was at the modern hotel - and we have eaten at the napa location also \u2014and was so excited to see this open Food and drinks did not disappoint!! Wish there were some things from the other menu that carried over but again (Tempura pineapple please !!!) amazing. Big complaint is the service was beyond unacceptable and it was a slow thurs night I know this sounds extreme but it might be the worst most neglectful service I can recall in a long time. Staff supplementing our \u2018server\u2019 might be the only reason we left a tip and that\u2019s not me. We are huge fans of chef and loved the food but all I can do is shake my head at the service it was of poor quality. We had the pad Thai and whole fish was amazing it\u2019s debonded crusted and and had great flavor. The only other negative is - and this isn\u2019t really against the restaurant but wow There was maybe a pre wedding group or office that was SO drunk and loud and yelling and using the most inappropriate language and describing inappropriate acts it made us want to leave and not order more drinks or dessert. We couldn\u2019t leave fast enough except wait \u2014 our wait person was MIA so it was 17 min after our plates were cleared we even were offered anything else. We actually saw a dessert on social media we planned to order and my husband really wanted another drink - he had a smoked old fashioned made tableside that was amazing - but again we were never check on or offered ... we thought maybe we ask to have dessert in the bar away from the disruptive party but again no. I will say the staff person attending to the party did ask them to please be polite and know this is a family establishment and respect the noise and language but seconds later it went unattended.  I\u2019m sadly disappointed but loved the food and chef so that won me over",

It was incredibly delicious I had no idea it had so many layers each one being even more delicious!!! So so good. My only down point would be that the tofu with sauteed veggie wok wasn't as exciting. As a vegetarian it is very hard to find good restaurants and this meal could have been so much more exciting. Which is why I give only 4 starts. Apart from that the coktail menu is great and the blueberry cocktail I had was yummy and refreshing. The menu itself was very appealing (if you eat meat!!)",

We had the sticky ribs as an appetizer they were absoljutely delicious crunchy on the outside and uicy inside with a great sweet sauce, the only down side is that it comes  with 3 make it very weird for sharing.  For Entrees we had the Crispy Whole Fish wich was alright, nothing too special and it left my boyfriend still hungry after dinner since it doesnt come with any sides. I had the ishiyaki buri bop, the presentation was amazing as it is seared on the table, but flavour wise it was very average. Too much rice for the meat ratio and seemed likke it lack flavor in my opinion.  It is average in price with other similar restaurants in the area.",

Both were excellent and great for sharing. Really loved the short ribs!  For our mains, we shared a rainbow roll, Kung Pao Chicken, kalbi short ribs and chef Morimoto's signature dish (buri bop). Everything was excellent! Great for sharing! The buri bop is prepared at the table and is super fun to watch.  For dessert, we have the chocolate sphere and donuts.

First of all, this is a lovely restaurant and has a large menu offering authentic Asian fare for reasonable prices. We ordered a few items since this was our first visit and everything was delicious and served quickly.  Our server Michael was super attentive and did a great job taking care of us! He took the time to explain the food and even offered a few recommendations.  The website says the dress code is \u201csmart casual\u201d but they do not enforce it. There were people wearing sports shorts, flip flops and one guy even had a dog with him. Imagine my husbands face when he saw this and I had told him to put on slacks and an aloha shirt! Not happy. The website specifically says no shorts, but lots of guests were wearing them in the main dining room area.  There was one big problem: We ordered Yakisoba with pork and it never arrived. Sadly, this was the one dish that my husband wanted tonight but for some reason the kitchen never made it and offered no explanation why. Our server had cleared the dishes from our table and it still hadn\u2019t arrived so we asked him about it and he said that he would take it off of the bill and he didn\u2019t know why the kitchen didn\u2019t serve it. This was disappointing because we REALLY wanted to try the yakisoba, but everything else was delicious and I guess it was just overlooked. Michael removed it from our check.  If you only order one thing, I would strongly recommend the house fried rice!! It is full of flavor and my daughter especially loved the fresh edamame added to the dish.",

The maitre d' wasnt particularly friendly or welcoming, so that felt odd. The staff that served us were much more friendly but did not seem to know the menu, so that was also a mixed experience (basic questions about what was in the dish were met with 'let me go check'). The food was also a bit mixed. We had a blackened swordfish dish which was delicate and tasty, however, I can't really remember any of the other dishes so they were neither terrible, but nor were they great.  Overall, we spent upwards of USD200 for 2 people without actually being full - so we could have spent more but thankfully didnt. At that price, you always expect friendly, expert service with a smile, knowledge of product and excellent, consistent food. Yes, McDonald's can do it, so why can't you? The 3 stars is for the swordfish. The rest doesn't even deserve that much.",

My partner had the shrimp pad thai which I thought was just ordinary. The ribs were wonderful but the tuna pizza was just ok.

We had a busy 16 month old with us and he was her favorite. It wasn't busy when we went (a little early in the evening), so he would stop by our table periodically to chit chat and keep her happy. Very fast getting everything we ordered to the table. Food was good - an elevated version of most Chinese dishes we've had where we are from. The chocolate sphere for dessert was fun and delicious!!

Food was great and so was the service and this was reflected in our gratuity.  On our second visit we were very disappointed. The food may have been cooked well but if your table is bombarded with it and you can\u2019t enjoy every dish to the fullest, just means you\u2019re really eating 50% of the meal, and paying for 100% of it.  At $200+ excluding wine for three it\u2019s expensive. Maybe Mr. Morimoto should look at spending some time in his establishments to ensure customer satisfaction instead of leaving it in the hands of those who aren\u2019t capable of fulfilling that promise.  Standards in both service and execution need to be upheld. This is a long standing Japanese tradition, a tradition that ensures perfection on delivery.  Michelin star deserving no. Expensive yes. It\u2019s a gamble at best, and as usual the odds are in the favor of the house.  Looks like Rusty should be a more accurate moniker than Iron in this case and at this rate \u201cseppuku\u201d is appropriate.",

We had to wait 30 mins for our seats and about an hour for our food to arrive.  I had the Tonkotsu which was underwhelming. My friend had the Garlic Shrimp which was not fresh, it tasted like frozen shrimp and the shell was very flaky and didn't come apart in one piece. The drinks served there was more ice than drink.  The table service was pretty bad, it seemed under staffed and servers running around like chickens. They were nice and polite but waiting 30 mins+ for our drinks and appetizers was a bit much. The also had table side cooking which filled the whole room with smoke which made dining unpleasant.  I had high hopes for this place because of the name and the location of this place but was let down.  The only saving grace this place has was the melted chocolate dessert, which seems like the only reason people come here for.  Cool experience, but not worth the wait for the food. You will be waiting for a while....",

We were seated and the waitress recited a whole paragraph about how they would serve the food one by one and there would be a presentation for each dish. The manager took our food order which seemed as though he did because we were sitting there with our menus closed for a few minutes. Then the waitress came and asked if the manager took our order.  We had to wait for our drinks a little longer than expected and the refills were also very slow and we sat there waiting for our drinks before we could continue eating. There was no special presentation for our food as the waitress presented at the beginning. Our food was just placed down and the table and the server walked away. Hmm what was all that about at the beginning then?  As far as the taste of the food, the fried rice was good and didn't seem like as big of a portion as expensive expected.  Our waitress did nothing for our anniversary as we have seen other reviewers get a complimentary dessert for their anniversary...disappointing when there is nothing to acknowledge a special occasion, especially from a high end restaurant. We didn't even receive an acknowledgement from our waitress.  Not worth the money spent. Lack of communication between staff.",

Sad that Chef Morimoto has licensed his brand like this. If you want a real Morimoto experience, go to his restaurant in NYC.",

My wife and I are staying at this resort on our honeymoon and wanted a nice night out at this new restaurant.  Everything was going great at first, however, a couple was seated next to us and JUST ordered and received their meal before us (we were already seated for 30 minutes and waiting for our main course). We looked over and realized they were served our food. They were already halfway through eating. Only when told, the servers realized their BIG mistake.  Instead of providing immediate service for THEIR mistake, they asked us if we still wanted our food and informed us that it will still be \"a while longer\". We even heard them joke with the couple next to us if they enjoyed their \"extra food\".  We received our order another 30 minutes later.  We asked to speak to the manager.. and explained the situation and how it was handled. He offered us free dessert. We refused. He did not charge us for our main meal but only the appetizers and said if we come back we will be \"taken care of\".  We should have left without paying for anything, but we have more class than that. We paid for our appetizers and even left a tip. We work in the food industry back home and understand the importance of customer service.  We will not be back nor recommend this restaurant. We feel our situation could have been handled with more professionalism.",

Loved all the dishes that we got like it was made for our taste. Our server was that little asian looking girl with a little dark skin and she was really sweet I forgot her name but if you see her tip her well!

        "caption": "I used to live in Hawaii a few years ago and have come back just about every year. This restaurant is by far the best restaurant (in terms of quality and night atmosphere) I\u2019ve ever been to on Oahu.  My husband and I came out to enjoy the casual and low key lifestyle of Hawaii but after a week, missed something a little nicer and wanted to try this place out.  We\u2019re very accustomed to the city life of Denver and it\u2019s upscale restaurants... I would say that the food, presentation, and service here blows all of those overly priced, fancy steakhouses out of the water!  We had the orange chicken and kalbi. Both were cooked PERFECTLY. The Kalbi METLED in my my mouth (very uncommon, couldn\u2019t believe it) and the breading on the orange chicken had an amazing after taste (didn\u2019t even know that was possible).  The plain white rice was even soft!!! I\u2019m Asian American, I thought rice was basically cooked and tasted the exact same way haha  Our server CariAnn and everyone helping her were remarkable. They were very attentive and always smiling.  We will definitely be back when we\u2019re on Oahu.",

        "caption": "I was excited to get a reservation for this newly opened restaurant in time for my 5 year wedding anniversary (and babymoon) on our Hawaii trip! We were seated on the balcony next to some obvious VIPs as they arrived after us to complimentary glasses of rose on their table while we waited and waited only to have my pregnant wife's virgin cocktail arrive with alcohol. By the time the correct drink had arrived, our VIP neighbours had already been visited by the manager and received their appetisers. The head chef had come out and cooked the VIP's table side dish himself before our appetisers finally arrived a full hour after we had been seated.... except they were stone cold dim sum. Despite the manager offering his business card so we could email him if we wanted them to make up for the experience, we left and headed to the Cheesecake factory for a delicious, well priced meal with honest, good service. I'm aware the restaurant had only been open for a few days but I expected more from an establishment with the Morimoto name.",
