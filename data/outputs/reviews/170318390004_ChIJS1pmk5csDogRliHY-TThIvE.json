Seems like they were more concerned with the to go orders rather than their physical customers. When I asked if I could split the ice cream half and half, the guy waiter asked the lady (must have been the manger) and she quickly responded NO with a harsh attitude. Then to top it all off, she came by the table (they never came by once during our meal and asked if everything was ok) and scolded my boyfriend for leaving less than a 10% tip. If it were up to me I would have left nothing! One of the worst restaurants and experience in the south loop. There\u2019s no wonder this place was empty!",

I asked her if I could have the sauce they put on the Pad Thai and was told I could only order extra peanut sauce. So I told her ok as it didn't taste good the way it was. She then gave me a bad tasting peanut sauce. They could see I didn't eat any of it but didn't care. This was the worst Thai place I have ever eaten at and the worst service I have ever received.
