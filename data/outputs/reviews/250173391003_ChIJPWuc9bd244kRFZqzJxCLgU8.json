The tofu was saturated with so much oil, I could not eat it. The Tom Yung Koong had some kind of sickly sweet syrup drizzled into it- like eating melted candy. The Red Curry was okay but had a strange almost perfume-y, floral taste to it that masked all of the curry flavor.  Easy to order and came on time, but simply can't recommend due to the quality of the food. Sad to say my search for great Thai takeout in Boston/Cambridge continues.",

It's a small restaurant so advanced planning is needed for groups, but my toddlers and I pop in for lunch every now and then and they always accomodate.  It's also conveniently located on Forest Street near Route 60 / Salem / High St.  Great service.  Reasonably priced.  They deliver!

I especially recommend the drunken noodles with chicken. (Not pictured here -- the picture shows the garlic udon noodles, which are also a fan favorite.) The owner is the smiliest man you'll ever meet. Jokes aside, the management is awesome. Definitely recommend to anyone in the Medford Square area!",

We started with their Crab Rangoon (my favorite in the Boston area so far, wasn't greasy) and then we had bowls of their Tom Yum Koong soup - a spicy coconut concoction. Lastly we shared an entree of the Basil Crispy chicken w/vegetables\u200b. The presentation was beautiful and the meal was phenomenal!  Try this place out if you're craving Thai, it won't hurt wallet.",

Taro pancakes are solid, and the fried rice dishes are not overly sweet or oily.  Having spent a few years in Southern China, I was impressed with that last bit, as coming home, fried rice dishes have a tendency to be horribly over-oiled/seasoned.

Anytime we have guests, we order from this place, they never fail to produce exceptional food, and our guests are always amazed. I even had a guest who grew up in Thailand try this place; she has been living in New York City for over 10 years so I was nervous about what she would think about the food... she said it was some of the best Thai she has ever had.

Then when it came time for the order to come when it was supposed to, they were over half an hour late. Customer service is awful, and they didn't even try to make it right. Don't waste your time here. You'll be extremely disappointed.",

They don't mix too much on the menu or make it too much about the fusion asian side of the house.  Most of their dishes can be made vegetarian if you ask but i've pretty much stuck to the Pad Thai with Tofu or the Pad See Yew with Tofu and I haven't been disappointed.  Their spring rolls are also good but nothing that exciting.",
