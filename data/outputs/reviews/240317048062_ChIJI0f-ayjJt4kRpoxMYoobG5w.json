For having ample amount of workers and the fact that we were sitting close to the bar service was super slow, in regards to arrival of the food as well as the attentiveness of our waiter. Food was bland. I got the enchiladas with the red sauce instead of the green in hopes that it would be spicy but it wasn\u2019t even remotely spicy and tastes kind of like a barbecue sauce, not what I expected. That might have been how they\u2019re intended to taste but wasn\u2019t at all the taste I was hoping and expecting. We also ordered a margarita to go and our waiter brings it in a regular glass and just hands us a plastic cup. Couldn\u2019t he have just put it in the plastic cup to begin with so we didn\u2019t have to fumble around pouring it in the plastic cup ourselves?  I will not be back.",

Their tres leches cake is the best I've had in the area: flavorful and super moist with sweet milk seeping out of the cake when you dig the spoon in, as it should be. I haven't had a single bad experience here.  Their outdoor seating area is perfect for pandemic eating. We live across the street and this is actually the first place we ate at after three months of takeout only.  TLDR: Great food. Eat here.",

        "caption": "Five stars for service. We arrived for happy hour when we were told we had to sit close to the bar on the patio. Empty plates don't stay on the table, and one of the chefs presented a grasshopper taco personally. It was about the size of a dollar bill, and it was delicious. The chicken tamale was too.  The drink menu featured exotic flavors like tamarind and sorrel. Everyone in my party really liked how the drinks were crafted. (I could have used more triple sec.) The prices were a little high, but you won't find a restaurant like this anywhere else in the area.",

The house chips and salsa were excellent and after a few rounds of drinks, we gave in and ordered a piece of tres leches cake.
