My first order kept getting pushed back to a later time and then it was suddenly canceled due to no driver after almost an hour waiting. I decided to try again and order the same thing but for pickup. Then when order was ready for pickup 10 minutes after the designated pick up time, they literally served the food from the canceled order number over almost two hours prior because my current one wasn\u2019t ready (the one where they actually texted the new \u201corder is ready for pickup\u201d). It was extremely unorganized and workers were hard to even track down to get my order, let alone a refund. So basically I paid $30 for super salty, cold, anemic looking wings where my pinky finger is literally bigger than half of them.  The other day I had a canceled order issue with them through GrubHub delivery. DON\u2019T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",

For example, the 10 piece wing that I purchased, the drum wings were toO big that they were kinda killn my vibe as I tore em up because as I bit in the chicken I also bit fat, and that is no bueno. If I was to purchase my wings I would look for a good size portion of a wing instead of a jumbo type wing. Also, as you get into these big size of wings you are risking the fact that your wings might not come out with a good crisp.  ## Find a smaller wing size, just not too small  ## lighten up season-by at-least 15% on your sides  ## if I choose and even # in wings give me half drum and half flats",

The guy behind the counter offered the two 70 year old men after me a $2 discount if they had a tattoo but not to me because he knew damn well I had a few. Then I asked about it and he played dumb.
