I tried to place an order for an event for 30 people about 3 weeks in advance of the event, and was always told to come back or call back later because they were too busy at the time. I went to the store and got the cell phone number of the owner who gave me a specific day to call and place the order. I did as instructed, and then was told to call on another day.  Again, I did as instructed. And was eventually told that they were too busy and wouldn't be able to cater the event. Their food is good but the service is completely unprofessional. I would not recommend them to anyone and will discourage people I know from using this catering company.",
