When I walked in the store the first time, Hosam suggested me to try the platter. The platter comes with the rice, meat, salad and side dish. THOSE FOODS ARE VERY FRESH AND WELL SEASONED! Even the salad dressing & hot sauce were freaking fresh and awesome too.. I guess they make their own. I've never ordered the lamb meat ever since I had spoiled one from the food truck in the Bronx but Zaad knows what they doing!!! The Second time, they recommended me Lamb Shawarma Wrap. The meat was moisture and the vegetable was soooooo fresh. I kept forgetting to take a photo to leave the review after I ate them all lols but this time, I took the photos before digging in! Thank you for the wonderful serving all the time. This place should be more popular!! (They have the desert too. The texture was like a puff pastry with crushed nuts. It was crispy and sweet like honey flavor!) Love you guys!!!!!!",
