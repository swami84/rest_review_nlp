        "caption": "Oh my GOD their cinnamon rolls!! I genuinely think they are a contender for the best desserts I've ever tried in my life, which includes the 21 years I was not a vegan. They were so rich and moist, absolutely leagues better than the several vegan cinnamon rolls I've tried in recent months, and better than any nonvegan one I've tried. Perfect in every way, but the thing that blew me away the most was the bottom, it had this incredible layer of nearly hardened, chewy, caramelized cinnamon roll goodness.  Excellent food and pastries overall.  The best vegan cupcake I've ever had.  When my friend and I went vegan back in 2015 we tried their cupcakes back then, and we honestly thought they gave us the wrong food, it just didn't compute that this was a vegan cupcake, it was one of the best I've ever had, if not the best.  We contacted them and they said indeed it was!  Healthy options too, the Med Bowl is unbelievably satisfying. Lots of whole food selections on the menu, my only gripe would be the lack of 100% whole grain breads or wraps, at least the day I was there.  For comfort food I've recently tried the Crispy Chik'n sandwich, which was good but a little lacking in flavor punch. Maybe could use more or more prominent pickles, and more sauce. A kick of acid and spice maybe. Also the patty was a bit too thick.  Also recently tried the strawberry cupcake, spinach mozzarella biscuit (great), bacon cheese and kale danish (great), pecan coffee crumble (topping a little too dry but tasty), chocolate icing and marshmellow donut (I was told this had butter cream filling, but it was sadly just a light chocolate filling.  Pleased that it was fluffy dough rather than cake inside, but it was lacking in saltiness overall), marshmallow boston cream donught (pretty great), some kinda apple muffin with caraway seeds on top, pb&j bar.  For produce, they have a good selection, including black, and yellow/green striped (my favorite) figs in season.",

I\u2019ve got this cake for my husbands birthday and it was a big disappointment. Why?  1. Filling: There was no raspberry flavor at all, there was no raspberry mousse layers in between the cakes. There is no cream or something similar to cream inside, just very very sweet frosting. 2. Cake: The cake wasn\u2019t fluffy and light. It was more like a bread texture, not a sponge. There were a few red spots in the cake. Was it supposed to be the raspberry flavor?  Clementine Bakery why don\u2019t you pack your vanilla raspberry cakes with raspberries instead of ultra sweet frosting? Raspberries are 100% vegan. Are you afraid the cake would get soggy? This cake is made to order, so it doesn\u2019t sit in a fridge for days. I asked for extra raspberries on top of the cake, which was the only raspberry taste (I was charged 5$ extra for this).  I bake breads and vegan cakes myself, I know how hard it might be to get a light and fluffy spongey, perfectly moist cake, but it\u2019s possible. If you\u2019re not able to bake a good spongey cake, why don\u2019t you compensate with  amazing fruit filling? Clementine Bakery owner: I would suggest you order this cake for yourself and try it and see what can be improved.  My husband didn\u2019t like the cake at all and it ruined the bday vibe!",

The entire menu is amazing, so if they happen to run out of some things before the end of day, don\u2019t be afraid to try something else on their delicious menu! Keep in mind you may not get a seat right away, but you could just head right down the street to the next block and grab a seat at their sister cafe/bar called Izzy Rose. They have lots of plants inside both locations which makes them lovely places to hang out.",

Two times I\u2019ve ordered online and I\u2019ve waited over an hour and 45 minutes before my delivery person left because they stood there too long waiting for their order. I gave them a second try and the same thing happened again. They don\u2019t care about the people ordering online only the people that are in store. Both times the delivery person made a similar comment to me that they always have problems with this place and waiting for order(the delivery people are on the clock and working too!!!). The first time I went there I waited 45 minutes on site for my food. It was very good quality but the Service and lack of urgency left such a poor taste in my mouth I wouldn\u2019t want to give them any money again.",

My second trip to this bakery was a complete fail - the bagel was dense and stale I did not eat it and went to bagel world down the street instead (vegan options available). My latte was basically water with a bit of coffee and soy, I asked to have it remade and it was marginally better but not enough for me to drink and lastly, the jalapeno and cheese scone was bland until you eat a bit of the jalapeno which was so hot I could not eat the scone. I don't know who created the meals but this was disappointing and wasteful of food and money, I ate nothing of that days purchase. I would not recommend this restaurant. I wish I had read the reviews before going. The service was ok the first time I went but the second time I went and asked for my latte to be remade I was given some attitude.",

I want to love Clementine, I\u2019ve come here several times hoping for a better experience but I\u2019ve been disappointed almost every time. And it\u2019s not an experience that is just exclusive to me, my friends have experienced the same issue.  The kitchen staff is HORRIBLE. There is always an issue with my order. Sometimes they are out of an ingredient and don\u2019t even tell you, sometimes they will jus blatantly \u201cforget\u201d an  ingredient that is supposed to in the item, and then best of all is when you ask for a modification and they can\u2019t even keep up with that. It\u2019s sad because I want to love this place, but I cannot pay $12 for a burrito that has only tofu and six leaves of spinach. How do you consciously put a PILE air tofu on a wrap and just hand it off? I don\u2019t get it. Avoid this place if you don\u2019t want to be ripped off.",

The lunch options are extremely solid but the baked goods, and especially the cakes and muffins, are what makes this place worth a trek even from elsewhere in Brooklyn. The very best time to go is around 9-10am on a weekend, when the pastries are fresh out of the oven. It can be hard to get a table at busy times, but if the weather is cooperative it's lovely to sit outside and enjoy the passing foot traffic on Classon & Greene. My only real quibble is that they'll sometimes run out of danishes pretty early in the day, so getting there earlier is definitely better.",

The cauliflower curry was awesome and the portion huge. The flavours were really satisfying and it kept me full for hours on end - which doesn\u2019t always happen when I eat vegan food. They ran out of chutney, so they substituted with cranberry sauce. I really wanted to try one of their sandwiches but they ran out of gluten free bread - but I suppose it gives me an excuse to go back. The double Chocolate cupcake was good because the frosting itself was delicious! As for the cake part it was a little dry and rice-y but not bad. Definitely would go back to try more! For what it was, the prices are definitely very reasonable too :)",

I called today to find out how I could pay for said cake being that I never got the followup call after the confirmation email. No biggie.  I get a well worn sounding woman on the phone who seemed slightly annoyed prior to picking up the phone, only to be told that \"there is no more space\" for orders after explaining that I had placed an order online and wanted to pay. Okay? Don't call the people who placed orders and let them know their order isn't valid so they can go elsewhere for business instead of waiting for a call that wouldn't come, that makes sense. I think you should take the option down or put up a banner that says you are no longer taking orders, so people won't be ordering thinking they can do something nice for someone in their lives, when they obviously can't.  I didn't want to beg, but I explained my situation asking if there was anything we can do and she said \"come into the store\" right after I told her I'm placing the order from halfway across the world :[ womp womp womp. Guess that's how it is when you run your own business.  Just a heads up for people trying to get vegan goodies out to the loved ones in their lives; either order way in advance or don't order at all, that seems to be how things worked for my first experience.",

This place does a great job at being on the healthier side of vegan comfort food but doesn't sacrifice any of that warm, fuzzy, deliciousness that you crave when when you wanna pig out (get the jalapeno cheddar biscuits!!). The atmosphere is gorgeous with beautiful white walls and plants all around. When you walk into this place you walk out of Brooklyn and into a happy little world that you are only too glad to be a part of.",

I used to come here every day off when I lived in the neighborhood and now I commute every now and then, because I moved super far, for my favorite grilled cheese and blondies!
