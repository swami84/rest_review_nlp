It was acidic, well balanced buttery, white wine sauce with just the right amount of capers. So, I ordered two tonight to have leftovers for lunch for a few days. What I got was some sort of Frankenstein amalgamation of Chicken Piccata and spaghetti marinara. Either the cook had no freaking clue what he was doing in the kitchen, or decided this order came in too close to closing time ahead of their day off and wasn\u2019t worth investing the time to make a good white wine sauce. So, they pan fried a chicken breast in butter, lemon, and capers and then dumped it on top of a soaghetti marinara. The entire point of me ordering this was not wanting a tomato based entree. I\u2019ve requested a refund for both orders of the chicken piccata.",

There's a reason GM's is known as having the best mussels in DC, and the beer selection is fantastic as well. We went to GM's for Mussel's Monday, which offers $12 mussel servings. Here's what we had:  GM's offerings for their top pairing of food - mussels and frites - is supplemented with their creative sauces for each. We ordered the Mariniere, Spicy Thai Curry, and Chowder to get the full range of tastes. Our group was impressed by the creativity of the spicy thai curry, the hearty chowder, but the back-to-basics mariniere show's why this place is the best place to get mussels in dc.  Don't sleep on the delicious frites either, because they have their own set of creative sauces too. Truffle mayo, dijonnaise, chiptole mayo, SAMURAI SAUCE, horseradish, and curry mayo. They're the perfect compliment to the mountains of mussels you'll be consuming.  You can't go wrong with their beer selection, so here's my only recommendation: The DC Brau Doctor's Dubbel. It's the house beer and only available at Granville Moore's!",

She never checked back to see if we were enjoying our meals and if we wanted anything else. The restaurant was not busy,  so there was no valid excuse for her ignoring us - though there was an explanation.  She was so busy chatting up the bartender, she apparently didn't have time for the tables she was supposed to tend.  Mussels and fries were delicious. Steak was mediocre. Waffle dessert was inedible. It tasted rancid, and 3 of our party who tasted it spit it out in their napkin. Our server did not seem to notice or care that 5 people only touched 3 forkfuls of dessert. Given her demonstrated lack of interest in customer service, we didn't waste our breath complaining.",

I\u2019m going to post this review with a single issue related to the mussels that they tout as the best running for 10 years in DC. It should not stop you from visiting, in fact, it should only encourage you to visit with the pretense that they will read this review and do something about it so that they go for another decade.  Mussels are like the milk to my cereal. I love them, I feel nirvana when I eat good ones, I often daydream about harvesting them from mudflats. I recognize how they are as particular as grapes regarding the area that they cluster and, as such, can take on distinct characteristics. On one occasion I ordered the mariniere; it was a Saturday brunch where I brought a group of guys. I was the only mussel fan among them so I had them all to myself. Here\u2019s the thing, they were not worth talking about. They had a taste that I kept to myself, but I couldn\u2019t tell if they had passed by the handoff to be kitchen or simply beyond their prime. Either way it was not a good batch and it makes me hope that the QC for their mussels will step up.  Otherwise great beer, fantastic staff, and a phenomenal recipe for even the basic frites. They\u2019ve etched themselves into a, hopefully, permanent corner of the neighborhood",

The steak was perfectly prepared, the crab cakes were meaty, and the portions were generous. I didn't try the mussels, but I wish I had. I recommend making reservations if you want to sit at a table; most of the space is reserved for the downstairs and upstairs bars, both of which were filling up by 6:30pm.",

We thought the mussels were okay, but not as good as some other places we've been. We ordered the frites, and while they were good, they were not served with the sauces that we ordered (and they were supposed to come with). My mussels were supposed to have sausage in the sauce and there was none in the entire pot. Our waiter tried to point out the sausage to me, putting his finger close to my food (pointing out mushrooms not sausage) and poured beer all over my foot. Overall, we did not enjoy the experience and will stick with our favorite places for mussels.",

We are always in search for great mussels after having an awesome experience with mussels in Maine.  I looked up places to try in the DC area and of course Granville Moore\u2019s came up \u2014 so we made reservations for date night.  The food was delicious, the beer was awesome with an amazing selection to choose from.  We ordered the gnocchi Mac & cheese to start and shared two mussel bowls.  Both were very flavorful and amazing. As date night winded down \u2014 my boyfriend was signing the check when the LARGEST COCKROACH I\u2019ve ever seen came scurrying down where table met the wall and made a beeline for me. Me not a fan of bugs in general and definitely not in a restaurant setting \u2014 yelped out and jumped out of our booth.  My boyfriend just wanting to bring attention to it to the waiter \u2014 alerted him.  The waiter just batted it off the table onto the floor near my boyfriends feet.  On our way out I alerted the hostess \u2014more so that if she sat people there she was aware.  She immediately asked if \u201cthey took care of us\u201d upstairs and that the owner was in the kitchen. My telling them wasn\u2019t so that we could get comped... really just and FYI.  I\u2019m sad to say that this was our first and last time we will eat there. Even sadder as the mussels were so freaking good but makes me wonder where else those cockroaches have crawled around. Bittersweet experience :(",

I am from Belgium and I moved to H-Street DC just three weeks ago - back from Afghanistan and Nepal - but so this was my frequency over the past three weeks.] I am old and bald, but I still get asked for an ID to check my age when I order a Belgian beer. I mean: I am an old Belgian, right? You should recognize one when you see one ! Just awful ! And then when you order moules-frites, you just get a handful of moules and over-cooked and over-salted frites (the kitchen doesn't know you should just dip fries twice in the oil to give that golden color - instead, they just keep it in). Well.... In short, for a Belgian, it's just a disaster. I will just walk over to the Mexican place across the street and have great food and booze from another cultural zone for a fraction of the price. So... In short, don't go for the great Belgian/French/European moules-frites experience at Granville Moore's. There must be other places. Maybe I should start one. JL",

My friend is in the food service industry and speculated that the server did the bare minimum because he didn't think we would tip well because of our order. Idk if that is true but I do know that is not the way to get repeat business.  DC has too many great food choices and experiences to settle for luke warm food, a watered down drink and grudging politeness. I won't be back.",

My friend ordered \"THE GOOD DOCTOR scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, avocado, chipotle mayo on potato kaiser roll served with home frites\"  He ate the fries (with a lot of water) and left the rest. He had added the smoked salmon to his order which was cold and covered in the chipotle mayo. The eggs were flavorless.  He also ordered the cinnamon rolls which were cold.  I had ordered the \"CHICKEN & MUFFIN fried chicken breast, English muffin, sausage gravy, fried egg served with home frites\"  The fried chicken was flavorless, the eggs tasteless and the biscuit was cold and dry - like something store-bought.  The gravy did have an intriguing flavor that reminded me of Middle Eastern food - and I am still trying to think of what the flavor was but it wasn't enough to save the meal. I did take it home so not to waste food and was able to salvage it by adding my own spices and ingredients, but what was served to us was not worth the $40.",

It's a small restaurant tucked away on H Street. It's very small and only has a few tables. It's dark and grungy inside, but it somehow works and is not off putting.  They are known for their mussels. My wife gets the seasonal mussels and the sauce is what makes it. They give you a basket of bread to dip in the sauce and it's so good (I don't like mussels, but oh man, that sauce). The mac and cheese is good and the fries are excellent (get the garlic ranch and/or the chipotle mayo to go with it).  The beer list is amazing. Every server is a beer expert (or at least comes across like it) and they always have specials. My favorite is a sour ale Duchesse de Bourgogne. It's amazing!  I'd go back to Grandville Moore's for sure!",

Huge selection of Belgian beers and others. Staff is very knowledgeable about their beer list and ready to make recommendations which is great for adventurous drinkers.",

Upon arriving, we were whisked straight back to a closed-off closet without heat or insulation. There were four tables in this back \"room\" and every single person kept their coats on (and zipped) throughout the meal. With temps well below freezing outside it was brutal being forced to eat dinner in an ice cave. Everyone found it bizarre and irksome that the hostess didn't warn us of the space or give us the option to wait for a table in the main dining room at the bar. Where others found the space charming, we found it cramped and poorly managed. The only thing that lived up to expectation was the beer. GM's offers great seasonal variety, both by the bottle and on draught. Prices are a bit steep \u2014 $11 for a beer on H Street is borderline absurd. Mussels were salty, lacking true flavor, and all around unimpressive. One batch on our table reeked of gym socks \u2014 appetizing. Fries were fries, dipping sauces were dipping sauces (and far too salty). Again, what's so special about this place? Service was irritated, unhelpful, and downright rude. All of us left GM's dissatisfied and annoyed at how much we had to pay for the displeasure. It will be a long (if ever) time before we return.",

They can be pricey, but the price usually scales up with the alcohol content, if that matters to you.  Let's talk food, though.  There's really only one thing here that I ever eat but it's one of the best things I've ever eaten in DC.  It's their Frites...which for us normal folks means Fries, and they're OK if you order them that way.  These are grandmaw's fries.  Home fries.  Fries you'll fight a hobo for.  literally, they're that good.  We've made special stops here after nights ON H st just to make it in time before the kitchen closes just to get a taste of these babies.  So many sauces!  So much deliciousness!  You won't be left unhappy.  Oh, also come for the visuals.  This place is very rustic and very comfy to me.  It just feels...right.",
