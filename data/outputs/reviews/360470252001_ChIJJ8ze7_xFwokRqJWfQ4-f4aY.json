Its priced very generous in time like this, for me with 1 order, it really fills me up at first I thought they made a mistake and putting 2 orders in one, I ask the boss, she said that is 1 order. The texture is smooth and thin. It's a simple 2 pages menu with 1 listing all the drinks and second, provide all the Rice rolls and you can customize, also the choice for Hong Kong-style curry fish balls. Only wish they have one in Staten Island, even after the next day, just microwave with a wet napkin and it's damn Good again. For me they might need to improve the meat one.",
