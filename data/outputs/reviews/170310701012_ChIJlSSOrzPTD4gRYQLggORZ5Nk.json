We shared the super crispy spicy wings, sweet wings, fondue pork frittes, and popcorn chicken, mom had the Ganbeii salad and he had the Nomad burger. All of the food was AMAZING, the plum soju was great, and even though none of us like beer, we discovered that we actually kinda like the Korean mango beer and may play around with those some more. The music playing was a really cool mix, and Zuke (the manager) was very attentive, observed covid-19 protocols, and made the trip PERFECT!!! We will definitely be back to enjoy the patio as the weather gets better.",

The staff was so kind and served us drinks until they closed and by that time I had to order more ribs to go!!! If you are looking for great Asian BBQ Ganbeii is the place to go.

I had been interested in this place after hearing about their Mongolian dishes(I've been to Mongolia several times and loved it). It is a warm, comfortable place with a relaxing atmosphere for a good time. The servers are consistent and kind, with a lot of attention payed to detail. The food was delicious. It reminded me of my time overseas. I recommend the Mongolian BBQ. The servings are plentiful, and for the price you can't beat It. The \"icing on the cake\" is the imported beer from Asia. 10/10 I'm defiantly coming back.",

I had the Brisket, which was mouth watering good. Best I have had in the area. The bbq sauce is on the side, like all good BBQ places should be, and is a nice balance between sweet and spicy that is very smooth on the palette. The Brisket has such a nice smoked flavor though that I preferred eating it solo and letting it melt in the mouth.  Definitely coming back to try the ribs.",

We got the Fondue Pork Frites appetizer, featured in picture 2, and it was phenomenal! I then had their boulgogi while my partner had the BBQ pork sandwich, along with their homemade BBQ sauce , which were also both fantastic. The only critique I could say is that the menus didn't have what everything came with the meal listed, so we were pleasantly surprised when the sandwich came with fries and the beef came with rice and cabbage.  The staff are also super nice and very invested in their business, while doing a great job and providing fantastic food. If you get a chance, definitely recommend giving it a try!! They'll have their liquor license soon and will be going in full swing, and I know I'll be back to try it again Soon.",

For a few weeks, my boyfriend and I have casually spoken about visiting this restaurant \"very soon,\" And yesterday we were finally able to take some time Out of our busy schedules to walk over and sit down to experience it. I am extremely glad that we finally did, and after just one visit, we can gladly say that we will be back many, many times again!  We weren't sure if this place was BYOB or not, because no one had added it to Yelp yet, and we didn't see any alcohol on the menu online, but please know that if they weren't before, they are definitely BYOB now! We saw this displayed on their front window, and on a chalkboard outside while we were approaching. We live very close by so we figured we would just have a drink at home afterward since we forgot to bring alcohol, but if you are really looking to enjoy your dinner with a few sips of alcohol, there is a liquor store a few doors down where you can buy some. There's no corkage fee and no additional costs for bringing in your own drinks, and they have glasses and cups for whatever you bring in.  We stopped in yesterday, which was a Saturday around 6 o'clock or 6:30, and we were surprised because it wasn't very busy. We were cheerfully greeted by a woman behind the counter and were told that we could select where we wanted to sit. We chose a booth right by the front window, but I don't think there's a bad seat in the house. There was cheerful pop music playing over the speakers with some music videos on TVs behind the counter, and gorgeous wood lined the entire walls. The booth was comfortable and everything looked very clean.  We had perused the menu online before stopping in, so we both pretty much knew what we wanted: we ordered a hummus platter to start, and my boyfriend was very excited about the photo of the po'boy he saw online, so he got that. I went with a half rack of ribs which came with broccoli and rice, and was surprisingly only $15. I feel like that's a pretty low price for ribs!  Our food came out very quickly, and we were in awe of every last bit. The hummus plate featured cucumbers, celery, carrots and warm pita, and the hummus had spices that gave it extra flavor. My ribs fell right off the bone and are a STEAL at $15. I can't believe they're so inexpensive for how delicious, and they're smoked overnight! Amazing. We truly enjoyed Urban Nomads and will be bringing our friends and family when they want to go to dinner.  It's a no-brainer: be one of the first to experience Urban Nomads! You won't regret it.",

My favorite offerings of the evening were the chicken wings with a berry hot sauce and the flour-less chocolate cake.  Alexander told us he grows the berries for the sauce in his own garden and you can really tell the difference. This is a great community restaurant and I'm sure we'll be back soon.
