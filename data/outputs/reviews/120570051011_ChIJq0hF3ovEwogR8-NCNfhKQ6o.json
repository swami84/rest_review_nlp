While in line waiting to order a regular customer ( I'm assuming) jumped in front of me and the blonde cashier proceeded to take her order, without ever acknowledging that I was next. In fact, she only acknowledged me after seeing the look of disdain on my face. Small things such as this really tips the scales for me in relation to customer service. A little more effort can be employed !!",

When I arrived at this place my order was not even started and the manager just wanted to argue about the coupon.  The staff is rude.  I told them that they will be losing many customers over this and the Manager said that it was ok because they have plenty of other customers.  I have been to other Pita's since the first store opened and I know the founder.  He would be ashamed if he knew this.  Don't support these people!",
