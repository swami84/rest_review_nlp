My daughter's preschool is right near by so I'm planning to make this a regular stop.  Highlights are the chicken and lamb shawarmas, the made to order falafel, baba ghanoush and grape leaves.  The dinners are not cheap but the portions are enormous and really a great value and quality for the money.  It sounds strange to describe takeout as having excellent presentation, but in this case the description fits. They are always adding some fresh veggies or other burst of color to the plate to make it beautiful.  Will update with photos next time I go!",
