You can spend an afternoon schmoozing here with friends, relatives or business associates. One of my best meals was a lunch I had with my spouse and his brother.  We started off at 11 am and kept drinking and eating until it was 4:30 in the afternoon and lunch had been closed out!  Lunch ends at 3. They told us to take our time.  We had the entire place to ourselves, tipped mightily and were quite tipsy as we'd gone through at least three bottles of wine by the time we left. It was an event! It's a place where strangers will share their food with you!  Well, that's off limits for NOW, but the day shall return.  Filled with camaraderie and warmth.  Excellent servers and staff.",

The front house was very helpful got me the dessert menu and  said not to worry about dress codes. I order as appetizer the scallops. They were perfectly cook and the vegetables and sauce pairing zesty but not hot. I follow with a quail arugula salad.  the quail had a delicious smokiness with a perfect crunchy skin and juicy meat the vinaigrette dressing that blend the fruit and pecans making this a dish to remember and come back for more.  The salmon in the wine butter sauce with a pickle and wine sauerkraut was the perfect entre. The butter sauce on the perfect cook crust of the salmon  was accompany with fresh greens beans and potatoes making a light but well and full meal. To finish I couldn't leave dessert been Mardi Gra I went for the King cake. King cake is more of a bread dough texture that is pair with a beautiful creme with ice cream eam fresh strawberries and crumbs that give the perfect balance. Let's not forget the amaizing Carnival drink that I used to accompany this magical meal sweet but not to sweet eith a perfect hint of mint garnish and a delicious cherry at bottom. so Bon Appetit!!!.

Pretty much every guide said to come to Bayona, and, looking at the menu online, everything looked great.  The first huge issue was when we were trying to order wine. We asked for a recommendation of a drier white wine, to which our waitress went, \"Yuck. I only drink Bordeaux.\" Well, alright. It's pretty common for waitstaff to know the bottles on their menu. She then goes and points to every cheap bottle on the menu, saying things like, \"Well, since you're trying to save money...\" and \"Since you're on a budget...\"  Frankly, our waitress felt like we didn't belong at Bayona the entire time, going as far as saying, \"You sure? You might not like that,\" to what I ordered. While we were very taken aback by this, looking around the restaurant, we got an idea why she would assume we were too poor to be there. We are in our late 20s/early 30s as a couple, and everyone else in there was well into their 60s and 70s. The decor is what you'd imagine a fancy restaurant would look like in the 80s, with faded painted landscapes of classical Italy. If you're looking for a restaurant with a cool, inviting vibe, this is not it.  There is just too much good food in New Orleans to settle for rude service and dated atmosphere.",

I got the Fennel Crusted Lamb, which was average, there was an overwhelming taste of burnt soy sauce. My date got The Pacific Salmon and it was an outstanding. Very creative and refreshing. The dessert was well presented but extremely dry. We were quick to order but the dishes took an extremely long time to come out. By the end of the night my patience was spent and I was ready to leave immediately.",

I made reservations for a party of 11 for a birthday dinner hoping I\u2019d impress the group with my superior gastronomic knowledge of local fine establishments. Initially the staff was pleasant enough, but as the night wore on they became significantly less and less attentive and by the end of our meal I sensed they just wanted us to leave. The filet I ordered was tough, difficult to chew and probably both the worst and priciest cut of beef I've ever had. Because no one ever circled back to our table after our entr\u00e9es were served, I never had a chance to express my disappointment.  At a fine dining establishment I expected our waitress to show some concern after the busboy cleared my barely touched, inedible entr\u00e9e. Nope, she was totally unbothered and proceeded to serve us our bill + gratuity for a party of 11. I've received better service at Coop's Place. I chopped it up as a loss. Maybe those missed attempts at reservations were God's way of keeping me from having a rotten experience :(.",

Front of house staff were not that polished. Was not offered any drinks while we waited for our table. They also did not have any dedicated vegetarian entrees on their menu. They claimed they could make any of the entrees vegetarian but all they did was take the meat off the plate to make it vegetarian without substituting it with anything else. I felt bad for the two vegetarians in our party for basically having a tiny salad as a main. For a restaurant at this level- not having dedicated vegetarian dishes/ not being able to have the chef put a creative one together is horrible practice. Also the service is on the slower side which you start to notice. With so many good options in New Orleans- Bayona is a miss.",

We asked our servers to speed it up, because we had been sitting for so long.  After finishing the main dishes, desert was another 15 minutes later.

The wait staff was visibly upset with the kitchen and I witnessed a server almost crying as she apologized over and over to a unhappy table for something completely out of her hands. I think this place needs to not let the Zagat ratings get to their head and focus more on properly staffing, managing, and understanding what their kitchen can handle based on strength, wait staff, and kitchen staff available on those day.

Brought our wine and appetizers right away. After that, we literally waited an hour for our main course. With not one check in from Peyton. We travel all over the world and know fine dining. Unfortunately I would not rate this a high end restaurant mostly because of our service. Usually at finer restaurants the server cleans the crumbs in between courses and when there is a delay in the kitchen, the servers are attentive and apologetic. We got nothing and her attitude became snarky. Maybe she was stressed but when we come to a 5 star restaurant and drop over $600 we expect a polite server and timely delivery or at least a check in. I did see her glance a couple of times as she circled around but never once said \u201c hey there\u2019s a delay in the kitchen can I bring you anything\u2019. That would have been nice. And maybe scraping the bread crumbs off the table. I think this restaurant is over priced. Food was okay and service was bleak.",

I am very disappointed that such an reputable place could care less about such a horrible experience. As a manger myself, my intention was to get them some constructive feedback...but no one cares enough to even answer my email. I am sad to say, this restaurant has lost its way.

Another ran into the restaurant building.  THere were also loads of cockroaches on the wall next to our table.  The manager, when informed about the rats, cracked a joke about \"as long as they don't come into the building\".  When I called the next day to express my concern, she said they were trying to control it, but \"it's the French Quarter\".  When I said they need to shut down the courtyard until they have this under control, there was silence.  There was never an apology, or an attempt to make this right in any way.  It's not ok for a restaurant of Bayona's caliber and price point to have an unaddressed rate infestation.",

It was very pretty however there is a refrigerator that was very loud. The menu has a varied selection and I\u2019m sure most everyone will have a choice. Starters were generous. Mains equally so. I had a rabbit theme with p\u00e2t\u00e9 starter and stuffed rabbit for main. Both were amazing. I was surprised how tangy the rabbit p\u00e2t\u00e9 was. My partner had the shrimp and salmon. The salmon was cooked perfectly and very sweet. I can\u2019t comment on the shrimp due to allergy. This is an excellent experience and very different from many of the places in the area that feel tourist trap like. I feel I had great value and would recommend for all.",

The service was a little slow but it gave us time to digest than relax and have good conversations with each other so I appreciated it. We started with the cream garlic soup which was so good and I just wish they gave me more. I ordered smoked duck PB&J sandwich my mouth is watering as I'm remembering the experience. My girlfriend's ordered the barbecue shrimp with grits and the lamb. Everything was just so good I would like to go back and see what else to try on the menu. It's very unassuming and so it's surprising how delicious and complex the flavors are, you can tell a lot of thought and love went into the food. Wait staff was very friendly definitely a place to go back to when I come back to NOLA.",

And it was, indeed, fine dining.  Everything was really lovely. The courtyard was just beautiful, and the weather three weeks from now would make it the ideal lunch spot. It was a tad breezy and cool on Thursday (3/21), so they were very quick to accommodate our request to move inside.  We ordered a variety of dishes and sort of did our own tasting sample. Everything was delicious and came out beautifully plated. We also had some amazing desserts, and my sister claims the chocolate creme brule' was the best thing she had during our three-day visit. The Panna Cotta was also very nice with a very smooth texture and an unexpected herbaceous, almost savory quality. The fresh strawberries added just the right amount of sweet to the dish.  The service was also second to none, and the entire experience was just outstanding. NOLA has a frenetic energy, and when you walk into Bayona, all that slips away, and you are just surrounded by this comforting calm that comes with wonderful food. Over-all, this was a great final dining experience for us to top off our trip.",

I enjoyed the Stormy Monday cocktail, Bayona salad, and Pacific salmon, finishing it all off with the chocolate pecan tart. Everything was absolutely delicious to the point I can't imagine having a bad meal here. The patio was surprisingly (and refreshingly) quiet considering Bourbon Street is just one street over. Highly recommend Bayona.",

They had a lunch special for $30 per person on certain weekdays for the month of February so we thought we'd give it a shot. It was easy to make a reservation online, even for Valentine's day. We sat in the lovely courtyard under the banana tree. The lunch special includes an appetizer, an entr\u00e9e and a dessert, and champagne. Sounds like a pretty good deal right? Even better, to our surprise, they refilled our champagne throughout the meal. We added a starter (veal sweetbreads) on top of our specials. We spent two hours enjoying the food, the wine, and the good weather, and we didn't feel rushed for a single second. The staff are friendly and helpful. I'm quite happy that we stumbled upon this place as I would have never picked this spot if I were doing searches on Google maps and I'd be filtering out the $$$ places.",

Dessert finally arrived at 9:20, by which time our entire table had left and my wife and I joined another table within our group.  The manager's response was that the food was \"high prep\" so it takes awhile.  It doesn't take an experienced manager to understand that if your food takes so long to get to the table that your guests are leaving before receiving what they are paying for that there is a serious problem.   Unless you have nearly four hours to spend at dinner, you should not come here.  Surprisingly, the food was good if you could look past it being served cold because one poor waitress was trying to serve 25+ people by herself up a flight of stairs.  The operator of this restaurant will ruin it in a short time.  Make changes now.",

The place is really cozy/romantic/classic french quarter fancy restaurant.  Our server was pretty good, but a little too much after we had a few drinks if that makes any sense. We both ordered the cesar salad which was done not like the cesar I usually get everywhere else. The dressing tasted a little different. I really wanted to try te Garlic soup, our server was nice enough to bring out a tiny amount so I could try it. Totally regret not getting it lol. We also both ordered the salmon which was kind of a mistake but not.... The salmon was good, but it was on a bed of choucroute. It was tooo much for the fish. I should of read what it came with. It ruins the entire dish. I ate everything but that.  The veal sweetbreads was delicious. One of the best I tried on this trip. We had the sherry-mustard butter. It was bomb.  The drinks were weak though I will say that.  I really wanted to try the quail salad because I read it was the best there. Maybe next time.  Overall experience was pretty good. Expect the weird chourcrotue lol",

When we shared the concern about the entree's, the waiter appeared disinterested and brought our tab.",

I know this is standard for nice restaurants, but between the food, the server we had, and the atmosphere, I was happy.",
