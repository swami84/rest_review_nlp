I didn't enjoy the meal but I tried my best to enjoy and not try to be mean since we are all going through the hard time. Thr chefs didn't wear gloves and i also saw a chef writing (checking inventory or something) and touch the food after... I wasted $260 for stomachache all night.

Having been to many omakases before, I tried hard not to let the location or ambiance sway me and I really gave them a chance but...  We were completely mislead into thinking the $155 omakase would be worth it after seeing reviews on Google and Yelp, but this is THE MOST DISAPPOINTING we have ever had. The quality of the fish was not bad, but the presentation, pacing, service, portions, ratio, everything was TERRIBLE. We literally just received our miso soup and then were handed this pile of confusing fish in the picture and felt rushed to finish our soup. The texture and taste of the rice was so wrong - it crumbled and fell apart in every piece.  I really tried to give this place a chance, but every course was more disappointing than the last. The servers would repeatedly ask the same questions and though our chef was really nice, it was a disaster.  I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve left a meal this dissatisfied, almost angry, and cheated of money and time. SKIP THIS PLACE!",

Once inside, the place was reserved at capacity so was only able to get a 50-minute window. Service was attentive. Next time would grab a reservation to get the complete experience.  Ambience was that of an izakaya\u2014friendly, a bit of conversations flowing all around the restaurant, not at all pretentious.  Got the $75 set omakase (in place of the \u201copen ended\u201d option) at a table. IMHO, if you\u2019re used to \u201ctraditional\u201d Edo-mae sushi, this place feels very different. The pieces of sushi are gargantuan (many pieces benefit from being eaten swiftly before the seaweed gets soggy; this was a challenge). But if you\u2019ve ever gone to a sushi spot and worried you\u2019d need to eat after, that should be less of a concern here. There are some delicate touches with pretty generous portions to carry you through. The highlight for me was the isaki \u201cchicken grunt\u201d nigiri, which tasted like a light ono, or even a cross between yellowtail and mackerel\u2014rich while tasting of the sea.  Overall satisfied I tried this place. Would like to compare & contrast with Sushi ii since it\u2019s a block away.",

Not cheap, and if you want sushi rolls there are probably cheaper and still delicious options. If you want an experience and a ton of food, I recommend the Omakase.  Longer version: This place is surprisingly hard to find. It's on the third floor, not noticable from the street. Atmosphere is nice, somewhere between casual and dressed up. We sat at the bar and were entertained by the chef all night. The drinks were good, but the food was what we'd come back for. Like I said earlier, it's pricey. It's also worth it. The Omakase is 8-10 courses of small plates. It is almost too much for one person by the end. You get to try so many different types of fish. Everything tasted high quality. Some friends ordered a la cart and their dishes looked delicious. I definitely want to come back here, maybe as a special occasion place when we are craving raw fish.",

My husband I discovered this place on our second week in Honolulu - and we went there three times in one week (our last meal was there before heading over to the airport).  I would highly recommend sitting at the sushi bar and getting the omaskase. The way Chef Ryuji gets the flavours of the sushi - I'm still daydreaming about it.  I love Honolulu, and Sushi Murayama is definitely one of the top three reasons to why I want to go back sooner than later.  I would also recommend ordering the sake \"by glass\" - the way they pour the sake, you really get two glasses out of it... and it's a great way to try different type of sake.  If you are looking for a good sushi spot to taste some quality sushi - I would highly, highly, highly recommend this place.  Trust me - you won't regret it.",

Sushi is extremely fresh and sooooo tasty!! Everything what I tried was just top notch!!! People are complaining about size of the pieces for me it was a plus! The chef could be cheap and cut tiny pieces for the same price but he wants you to enjoy the fish to the fullest. This actually shows how good the quality of the fish is. You would not be able to eat big pieces if it was poor quality. That's one of the reasons many places cut there pieces very small so that rice and souse will take your attention away and you don't notice how bad the fish is. Prices are very reasonable too looking at the quality and the size. The chef is very friendly and made us feel very comfortable there. He also gave us very detailed info about every order he made, where the fish came from and all that. Great atmosphere. I would recommend this place to anyone who understands good sushi! If you want cheap average sushi that's not a place for you.",

The base Omakase coming at $75 is well worth its price, especially for its quality and quantity. I cannot accurately predict another customer's experience given another day, but I can say that in the menu, Chef Murayama demonstrates passion and drive to surprise the taster. While maintaining tradition of buying the freshest fish from Japan and locally, I can say every ingredient during the course was carefully picked and matched to the texture and flavor of the seafood. Not to mention, each slice (more like chunk) of fish was gargantuan, complemented by the colorful visual appeal of balanced level of marinade, dressing, and base.  On service, Chef Murayama and his staff are friendly and funny. You'll always hear some hearty laughter with customers. To get the best experience, take a seat at the bar, and you'll be both entertained and made well-informed of the art of seafood.  This is not an experience to be missed when visiting Honolulu. Don't expect to get sushi rolls with cream cheese here. This is for those who want not only an authentic sushi experience, but also take pleasure in seeing museum-quality culinary art and precision seafood engineering.",

If you're the person who understands, appreciates, and genuinely enjoys the skills of an exceptional sushi master, please honor yourself by requesting a seating here. Many selections are purposely brought in from Japan as well as the rice (which is wonderful)!  We chose the omakase, tempura moriawase, oyster shooters. Their menu represents a very good selection as well as their vast drinks list.  Parking is easy, and the atmosphere is welcoming. Service is wonderful! We will be back!",

The chef was friendly and prepared all of the dishes perfectly. The fish was incredible. My favorite was the hamachi and the chef informed me that he has his hamachi flown in from Tsukijis in Japan. He uses different seasonings for each sushi, including lime and orange zest, different shoyus, and Kewpie mayo. The different flavors are unique but they do not overpower the taste of the fish itself. The ahi was so smooth and the cuts of fish he gave me were humongous! The chef even offered us a free black sesame ice cream at the end of our meal which was so ono! We are definitely going to be getting that the next time we come.",

Because it's a chef's own course, you can try different menus that day. I liked the fresh and thick sashimi and the amount of rice underneath, so I liked it. Everyone ordered the Omakase course, but they ordered the bride and groom Chirashi. The menu that comes out is similar, but I think it's the difference between putting in one bowl at a time or separately. I think Chorashi is a good choice for a lunch menu. It's not a big restaurant, so it's better to make a reservation in advance~  (Original) \uac00\uc871 \uc2dd\uc0ac\ub85c \uc624\ub9c8\uce74\uc138 \ucf54\uc2a4\uc640 \uce58\ub77c\uc2dc \uba39\uc5c8\uc5b4\uc694. \uc77c\ub2e8 \uc624\ub9c8\uce74\uc138\ub294 \uc5b4\ub5a4\uac78 \uc2dc\ucf1c\uc57c\ub420\uc9c0 \uc798 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\uc744\ub54c \uc2dc\ud0b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc170\ud504 \ub9d8\ub300\ub85c \ub098\uc624\ub294 \ucf54\uc2a4\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uadf8\ub0a0\uadf8\ub0a0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uba54\ub274\ub97c \uba39\uc5b4\ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uac70\ub4e0\uc694. \uc2f1\uc2f1\ud558\uace0 \ub450\ud130\uc6b4 \ud68c\uc640 \ubc11\uc5d0\uc788\ub294 \ubc25 \uc591\uc774 \uc801\uc5b4\uc11c \uc804 \ub354 \uc88b\uc558\uc5b4\uc694. \ub2e4\ub4e4 \uc624\ub9c8\uce74\uc138 \ucf54\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dc\ucf30\ub294\ub370 \uc2e0\ub791\ud63c\uc790 \uce58\ub77c\uc2dc\ub97c \uc2dc\ucf30\ub124\uc694. \ub098\uc624\ub294 \uba54\ub274\ub294 \uc5bc\ucd94 \ube44\uc2b7\ud55c\ub370 \ud55c \uadf8\ub987\uc5d0 \ud55c\ubc88\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uc788\ub290\ub0d0, \ud558\ub098\uc529 \ub530\ub85c \ub098\uc624\ub290\ub0d0\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uc778\uac70\uac19\uc544\uc694.  \uce58\ub77c\uc2dc\ub294 \uc810\uc2ec\uba54\ub274\ub85c \uace0\ub974\ub294\uac8c \uc801\ub2f9\ud55c\uac83 \uac19\uc544\uc694.\u314e\uadf8\ub9ac \ud06c\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc2dd\ub2f9\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubbf8\ub9ac \uc608\uc57d\ud558\uace0 \uac00\ub294\uac8c \uc88b\uc544\uc694~",

I think next time we\u2019ll stick with nigiri sushi selections of their superb options, because the omakase portions were a bit too supersized for our tastes.  Almost too much of a good thing.

The quality of the food and personality of the chefs here brings back familiar regulars, and word of mouth seems to make overt marketing unnecessary.  You CAN order a la carte from the menu, but the most effective way to fully experience the tour de force from the chef Murayama is to put your fate in his hands and order the omakase menu AND sit at the sushi bar.  What a tour de force is.  The chef will ask you for your personal tastes, and tailor your experience accordingly. What you get as part of the omakase may be dramatically different from the person next to you. You can cut off the omakase when you can't take any more food. In the meantime, the stream of well executed kitchen items as well as the freshest sushi and sashimi will be presented to you.  The variety and freshness of his product is truly remarkable here. My 13 course omakase included fresh scallops from Hokkaido, sea urchin from both east coast Canada and Santa Barbara, jumbo prawns from Thailand, and wagyu beef sourced from various parts of Japan. I was blown away with every course.  Do be prepared to pay anywhere from $75 to a hundred or more. It's an expensive proposition, buy well worth searching for a nondescript restaurant and paying a reasonable price for some of the best execution in Japanese cuisine.",

His omakase isn't your typical run of the game omakase set. The chef here truly picks out fishes that he believes is the best of the day and serves that to you. I asked him why certain pieces or dishes aren't in his omakase when it's always in every other restaurants set, and his response was that he doesn't serve the same fish everyday because they're not always the best the day has to offer. I didn't get uni or otoro the day I went but that didn't mean my pieces were anything else than spectacular. Every fish that was laid in front of me was so fresh and I believe was the best of the best because I can't stop thinking about the fishes and how sweet they were. His portions are also generous. My favorite dish though would have to be his shrimp tempura. A dish I think is only mediocre everywhere else, I would have to rate his as a 20 out of 10. Seriously it was that good. I still dream of the p refectory coated shrimp that was so sweet and juicy and perfectly salted. I could eat dozens of those in one sitting. Make reservations ahead of time and try to get the omakase and don't be too picky about it. He knows what he's doing and if you can't eat that much, maybe just order Ala cart.",

We were so excited to check out their Omakase and experience that OMG factor that other people are raving about.  At first we were pretty excited as the sushi were fresh and delicious.  Here's what we had: - Marinated tuna w/nori - Sweet shrimp tempura - Flounder tail topped with seasalt - Saba belly - Tuna w/ fried garlic and green onions (by far our fave) - Big island abalone - Snow crab - Aji horse mackeral - Black throat snapper  A pretty solid roster you would think, right? Well, here's why this experience fell short to a 3-star review.  - The big island abalone nigiri was GROSS. It was extremely chewy to a point where it was crunchy.. exactly how you would imagine a raw abalone. I stuck the entire thing into my mouth and wanted it all to go away as quickly as possible. - I saw flies around the metal pan with the shrimp tempura. - A couple who came in after us ordered the omakase and was greeted to toro, sea scallops and a wider variety of tempura. We were only given one choice for the omakase, so I don't understand how and why this other couple would be given more premium pieces. - Lastly, part of why omakase is a fun experience is because the chefs are always friendly and knowledgeable. However, our chef prepped our omakase at the other end and never said more to us than what we were eating next.  I would definitely not recommend Sushi Murayama to any of my foodie friends.",
