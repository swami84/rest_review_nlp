I dont understand why they dont just charge a fix price and allow customers to have the all you can eat buffet experience like other places. Dont go there for the buffet it's super expensive!!

We ordered wraps and the kids were happy eating them which was also a plus. The last thing I want to write is that the little sauce containers of sides that restaurants usually send most often go in the trash for us after a few days sitting in the fridge, but the little sauce sides sent by this establishment were so nice and tasty that they are not the generic trashable sauce sides but really nice cac\u0131k and roast eggplant!",

One waiter (running around without a mask on...) was using his apron to smush them against the window. It was disgusting. Another man was insisting I place an order within 3 minutes of arriving. I feel disappointed because my precious 2 experiences were so good. But the fly situation is concerning. Something must be wrong in the kitchen. I shan\u2019t be returning here ever again. I hope that the owners deals with the flies and probably disgusting kitchen/rotting food situation. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 My original review: My first time at Anatolia was excellent. The service, waitresses and food were outstanding. Our waitress is originally from Turkey, she was a sweetheart. Definitely will be back and will be recommending this Brookline Village gem to my friends/family. Heads up that the rice pudding is the best I\u2019ve had outside of the UK. Go give Anatolia a try! Ask for extra Turkish lava bread (similar to naan) and try the Turkish tea!",

Each Doner came with a side and a small salad, and the restaurant even threw in DELICIOUS rice pudding. They definitely have earned themselves a new and returning customer.

Also really like the kunefe (made to order, so takes about 10-15 mins) and the kazandibi, burnt milk pudding. A couple of the waiters seem a bit clueless, but the others we encountered were efficient and nice. Never tried the buffet, but it seems like a popular option. They do breakfast until 3 pm on Sundays, not sure about other days.",

Most of the meats you see on the sandwiches was of course not in buffet. Only meats were some baked and fried chicken. The fried chicken tasted very old. In fact a lot of the food tasted very old sadly. There was some stew that tasted cold. The grape leaves also tasted too mushy. They had maybe 20 different foods and I tried a little of everything but nothing was fresh or that tasty. For dessert there was only 2 types of fruits. So if you are really hungry and desperate go for it. Otherwise just get something from menu or go elsewhere.",

While in Massachusetts recently however, I went twice and I was deeply disappointed. Service was horrible. The girl served us dessert while leaving all the dirty dishes. I had to call her many times to get her attention even we were the only guests. Furthermore, I feel that the hygiene is no longer a priority. I am not sure but I think there was change of ownership. I am going to attach a picture and I hope the owner is reading this review: your bathroom is disgusting and you're attaching the soap dispenser with rubber bands, you don't want to spend $10 to replace it, shame on you. I am sure you are loosing business because of that soap dispenser ( hundreds maybe). Get your act together and clean your place before you go out of business. I forgot to mention, lamb meat was microwaved because it was hard as a rock with no taste",

Yet, honestly speaking,  I wasn't expecting an utter disaster either. This was the worst Turkish food I have ever had abroad. My wife had lahmacun, the Turkish pizza made with grounded meat and I think it was not cooked at the restaurant, instead, it was re-heated and dry, and she did not like it at all! I did not want to touch it. I had mixed grill. Doner/gyro kabob was both overcooked outside and incredibly raw inside. Meat on my plate was greasy. The only edible thing was chicken breast. Not to mention lamb shish and adana kabobs, they were just awful! Again, lamb was chewy, overcooked, and even burnt. I would just say: we will never, ever go there again!",
