For appetizers, we ordered the spring rolls. It came with 3 pieces cut up in half.  The price was a little high at a little over $7, but they tasted great and is probably one of the better spring rolls I've ever eaten. For my main, I ordered the oxtail soup. Wow! The bowl was huge and was filled with 4 huge oxtails. The meat was really tender and flavorful. The broth was tasty and I like how the soup came with a lot of veggies. We came early so getting a table was fast but as soon as we were seated the place started to fill up. Great little restaurant with a friendly staff and good food!",

Don't stop there, try their crispy and flavorful spring rolls, rice vermicelli bowls, oxtail soup and pad thai, just to name a few. I appreciate how perfectly seasoned their pad thai always is, with just the right balance of ingredients. The sauce doesn't taste ketchup based. I like to order the chicken and tofu pad thai. Usually when you order this at other places, the chicken is dry, overcooked, flavorless and the tofu is pretty much the same. Here they manage to cook both chicken and tofu that is tender, juicy, and well-infused with flavor. Service is excellent, prices are reasonable. Try this place!",

Free parking is available on the side of the restaurant with a friendly lot attendant (not sure if he's an employee) to help maneuver the tight spots. The wait staff is very pleasant and attentive. I never once had to signal for more water. Favorite part about this place...the prices! The food is consistently delicious and fresh and I can spend less than $15. Large pho is $10.95, regular is $9.95",

When my assemble-yourself dinner arrived I had no idea what I was doing but this guy was SO KIND! He explained and quickly walked me through the technique. I absolutely loved my meal and had a great experience while my husband ate a half gallon of the house special pho. Great food, fair prices, and tremendous staff.",

That is exceptional service!  Pho Bistro is also an obvious local favorite as I was clearly the only tourist eating there at the time.  Get a regular size if you have never had pho before.
