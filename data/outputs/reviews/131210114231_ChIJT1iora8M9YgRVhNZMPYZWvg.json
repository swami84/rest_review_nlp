Since I absolutely HAD to share this horrible experience I guess this is sufficient. We had to pay before we received any food which was odd but we decided to give it a try. It felt like almost immediately after sitting down our \u201cwaitress\u201d (because she barley talked to us) brought out our food and at first glance the food looked pretty decent, I ordered a half rack of ribs, fries and coleslaw and my girlfriend ordered a turkey sandwich with fries and greens. From this moment on  everything went downhill. My girlfriends turkey sandwich was EXTREMELY dry. The turkey had no flavor at all and there was no toppings like cheese or anything except two straggly pickles. But even the pickles couldn\u2019t give any moisture to it. On the other hand the greens were practically drowning in the juice which consisted more juice than actual greens. Interestingly enough her food wasn\u2019t even the worst thing on the table. My $18 ribs were beyond disgusting, they were SO dry and had absolutely Zero flavor. I remember before we started eating we said a quick prayer over the food and I think that may be the only reason we survived the visit. After forcing myself to eat two of the $18 ribs I took one bite into the third and I couldn\u2019t take anymore. After barely enduring the atrocious ribs I tasted the coleslaw and not to my surprise, IT WAS DRY!! I have never in my life heard of dry coleslaw but somehow they pulled it off, and on top of that the coleslaw didn\u2019t even a decent flavor. The only thing on that plate that I could eat was the fries and even those weren\u2019t very good. By the time I stopped eating I looked at my girlfriend and said I have to ask for a refund because it was completely insane that I paid $30 (in total) for the food and it was that bad. After receiving my refund for the ribs( since they only wanted to give me my money back for one meal because my girlfriend ate the fries) we started getting up to leave and as we were walking out the door I said \u201chave a nice day!\u201d And not one said anything and we awkwardly walked out. Absolutely horrible customer service I wouldn\u2019t recommend \ud83e\udd2e",

Ordered pickup - full rack, corn souffle, hashbrown casserole, and Cole slaw. When we arrived, they were out of corn souffle. We were asked if we wanted another side but we did not because we figured the 2 other sides would suffice ( prior experiences my husband and I have always shared 2 sides and have had plenty between the two of us). When we got home, we saw the sides were small; one side was barely enough for one person. I then had to cook more sides on what was supposed to be an evening of not worrying about cooking. Thought the ribs would make up for that experience but they were the worst ribs I have ever had, maybe even worse than Dreamland up the road. The meat was so tough you could barely get it off the bone. Maybe it's a bad thing I have eaten here before and the ribs have always fell off the bone, but tonight, they were awful. Ended up having to make my family sandwiches after everything because we were still hungry after spending 40$ on our meal. In the past, I have always enjoyed Spiced Right. I even had them cater my son's 1st birthday and made sure to tell the guests about this \"hidden gem\" in Roswell. This experience, however, left a sour taste in my mouth. I do not think I would come back unless this experience was reconciled.",

The food was good and they give generous portions! We received our food quickly like within 5 minutes (seems like the food is already precooked and they just heat it up?). Parts of my ribs were a little hard/dry. But for the most part, it was tender and juicy.  My boyfriend loved the banana pudding. Said it was one of the best he's ever had. Will definitely return for some more bbq ribs!  Tip: parking it very limited",

Thanks Allison, Rob, Austin, and everyone else for putting this together for us and dealing with our constant changes in menu leading up to the day. You guys are rock-stars! Can't wait to book you guys again in the future - everyone thoroughly enjoyed the brisket, ribs, hashed potatoes and basically anything they could fill their plate with! Also - my husband, who is gluten-intolerant (and usually stays away from catered meals) knew exactly what was on the menu because Austin took the time to tell us all about the ingredients.

Ribs uninspiring!  Their saying \"If the Colonel had our recipe, he'd be a General\"  should be amended to \"he'd be dishonorably discharged.\" Called the restaurant & spoke with Rob, the manager.  He apologized profusely for how bad everything was.  Offered either another meal or my money back.  Took the meal because of other positive reviews.  Onion rings were better; not flavored to my liking, but that's a personal taste.  Brisket moist. Ribs were meaty.  Overall, a much better meal.  Unfortunately, it took my complaining for them to have better quality control.  I would recommend you try this place for yourselves. Flavor of everything not exactly to my liking, but then neither is the \"bloomin' onion.\"",

I will say that their cinnamon rolls are stellar! Staff is very nice and restaurant was clean.",

What really amazed me and set this place apart from other restaurants we visited during out time in Atlanta was that the customer service was spot on.  The staff was super friendly.  He gave me eye contact and was genuinely interested in what I wanted for my order and how my day was going. I told him that we drove here from Seattle and was looking at Atlanta cuz we may move here and he briefly told me about the area and his experience living here while I was waiting for my order.  Great service, food and staff.  Must try this place out,  AND DON'T FORGET THE FRIED OKRA! :)",

They make the amazing homemade doughnuts and cinnamon buns. I have a bit of a sweet tooth.  Their biscuits are to die for and they are reasonably priced . You can have breakfast here for the same price as any one of the crappy chain restaurants. This place makes real sweet tea . Not too sweet just right!! My go to is the brisket biscuit. It has an egg on it and comes with a very healthy portion of brisket. What can I say? I love this place",

So I ordered the BBQ sandwich plate which comes with two sides (I got the baked beans and fries) and a banana pudding. Everything came up to $16 and change. I expected some good tasting food for this price. EVERYTHING was under seasoned if not seasoned at all. The meat in the sandwich tasted like cardboard because again, they didn't season it. Also the baked beans I got as a side has pulled pork in it that is also not seasoned. THEN I open up my banana pudding and the first thing I see is a hair...I scoop the hair out and take a couple of bites and I then find a lemon seed (hoping that's what it was at least). I don't know if they make the pudding with lemon or what but that's what I got. A lemon seed. So all in all for $16 I got a hair, lemon seed and unseasoned food. Enjoy",

If you are going to complain you will lose a lot of business. If we were all dining in then yes a tip should be given. But take out? Little extreme if you ask me by getting upset about no tips when there was about $160 spent from individual orders. You are charging prices based on cost and labor. If that is not enough then raise your prices and stop complaining to paying customers, because that is how you lose them. *side note instead of complaining about our tips how about we make sure that our orders are right and we are not missing items that we paid for like Orange Juice.",

        "caption": "My ribs and and my husband brisket was so tender, that I could cut through with my fork. The greens were seasoned just right and I am picky about my greens. Potatoe salad was just like granny's. We really wanted to try the corn souffle, so we got a side of that and the banana pudding. The souffle was really good, but sweet and that banana pudding had to be scratch made. No instant pudding there. My husband and I kind of bickered over it. He got the most\ud83d\ude41. We went on a Saturday and the live music added to the atmosphere. Don't go here expecting it to be fancy, it's a hole in the wall in a really nice area, but the food makes up for it. Customer service was great too. Will definitely be going back. Also they support our troops past and present with a 20% discount.  If it's your first time here and you're on a date or with a friend, get the two meat and two sides combo. It's more than enough food two ppl.",
