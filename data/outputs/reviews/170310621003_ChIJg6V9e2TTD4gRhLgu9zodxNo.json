Though they could no longer claim that I was in the wrong they nonetheless refused to send a replacement. They did refund the cost of the item but not the cost of the delivery or tip which means that I paid a hefty charge for an appetizer and still had no dinner. I understand that mistakes happen and I do not demand perfection, But I do require that a business take responsibility for its mistakes and make a good-faith effort to correct the situation.

Would love to come back to try the other dishes as well as bring other people to try the hotpot. If you like spicy food this is the one for you but you can also ask them to make it less spicy.  When a restaurant is filled with the people of the same nationality, that's a good sign that the food must be authentic.",

Before the hot pot, we ordered some starter to fight for the long waiting. The red oil dumpling was made very sloppy. Most dumplings are over cooked and some of filling were out of the skins for boiling too long. I can image the cook throw the raw dumplings into the boiling pot and never remember to check if they were ready.  After we came to the hot pot table and tried our best to convince ourselves it was hard to mess up with hot pot, I was on the edge of the explosion.  The carb stick is totally made by flour but no sea food. It tasted more like low density rice cake.  The beef slices tasted better, however the full $8.99 plate only contains 6 slices of thin beef cut totally weighted less than 2oz! Amazing, that is only ordinary beef, but costed USDA PRIME!  The lamb slices were a disaster. Lamb slice is well know for its tenderness, however it comes with right cutting method orthogonal to the meat pattern. Otherwise it tastes like used Wrigley gums. Then they didn't it terribly wrong! Addition, it has 9 pieces less than 3oz and cost you around 7.99! Amazing!  Other dishes were way worse. The frozen tofu was really just come with ice and fresh tofu, the fired rice cakes was not evenly fried.  A day later, both my wife and I had some poising symptoms from it. We felt they also did a bad control of their cleanness.  Overall long complain, do not go!",

We got the hotpot 2, split in half one spicey w sezschwan WHICH ACTUALLY MADE MY MOUTH NUMB AS IT SHOULD. Most places claim to have it but the numbing is minimal, this was real.  My only gripe was the wait, we sat for about 1hr 20ish min for food to arrive but they were SLAMMED. Honestly the food more then made up for it. They even gave us free sesame balls to make up for it and they were next level.  Here is the secret. THEIR APPETIZERS MENU IS THE REAL MVP. not kidding we got dumplings, the GOLDEN BUNS GET THE GOLDEN BUNS, and the crab rangoons were clearly the best in the area.  Debating coming back this week and only focusing on the app menu it was that good",

Closest I've ever come was a Peter Chang (not P.F, big difference) place on the East Coast. Food is excellent, staff helped us through ordering for the hot pot.  For the uninitiated, Sichuan peppercorns are used, which add an amazing floral, peppery quality to some of the dishes, and also a numbing experience which is unique and fun. Do not pass up the chance too try it. Also, the staff recommend spice level one for me- I was skeptical, but it turned out to be perfect. It's actually spicy, the perfect amount to compliment the food without overpowering.  Those looking for something more traditional won't be disappointed either, there are plenty of really great familiar options such as orange chicken, crab rangoons, etc...  BYOB for now, take out is also speedy. If you're looking for something a little different and exotic or just a regular go to this should be your new best option.",
