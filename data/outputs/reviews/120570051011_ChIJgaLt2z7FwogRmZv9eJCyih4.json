It\u2019s an easy walk to campus, and on days when I\u2019m in a rush or it\u2019s raining I take the 220 shuttle or use the free bike service offered right outside the building. The apartments are modern and as a bonus it was nice to have the place fully furnished when moving in. The amenities are super nice, I use the gym and massage chair daily. Being in the middle of downtown I feel very safe in 220 with FOB locks on the lobby doors, elevator access, and locks on my apartment door and bedroom door. Christin is the property manager and she is awesome. She\u2019s always so accommodating for everything you need, sometimes I go to her office just to hangout and talk. The 220 team consistently offers covid-safe socials for its residents, my favorite is the free pizza almost every week. For anyone looking for a nice place to live in the heart of downtown Tampa, 220 Madison is the place to be!",

Rent includes all utilities ( Gym, Electricity, water, study rooms,etc)  3. Great amenities for a student housing  for the price and location.  4. Alot of restaurants within a .5 mile radius and is a 5-7 min walk to campus (U of Tampa) and is just off the riverwalk too. You will not need a car to commute and is the closest off-campus housing for a college student.  5. Maintenance requests have a quick turn around time.  6. Apartment/building bonding activities and events held every 1-2 months  7. Amazon hub lockers and free street bike access!  All in all, great experience, living there my senior year and could not have asked for a better place. Seems like they are still looking to upgrade further and great value for money.",

Over the course of construction both Omar and Christin reassured us that not only would the facility be top notch, but extremely safe and convenient. They didn't disappoint!  Since move in, we became very close to Christin who isn't only the building manager but is a friend and \"mom\" to the kids. She is genuine and sincere and definitely looks out for all of the kids' best interests. It'll be tough to find a follow-on landlord that will be as good once my daughter graduates.",

Now Christin is my favorite face to see coming out of the 3rd floor elevator when going to the gym, study rooms, to do my laundry, or to just talk things out with. She truly cares, is hands on, and will go above and beyond for the students living here. Because of her and those who have worked so hard in maintaining 220, it has really made me feel at home every single day.",
