We started with the Cesar Salad... and we couldn\u2019t stop raving. I can\u2019t imagine not ordering it whenever I visit.  The Buffalo wings with the bleu cheese, tender with great sauce offset nicely by the cheese.  Paul is a chicken pesto fan... to a fault.  A big thumbs up from Paul.  I recommend the house sangria... tasty and almost too easy going down.  Great beer selection.",

Food are reasonably prized. You can taste the freshness and healthiness of their food!  I always order margherita pizza and that's what i ordered there. It was phenomenal. Just so good. The cheese.. The pizza even had a tiny fresh tomatoe.. Like an actual tomatoe. \ud83c\udf45 lol that's how fresh. My boyfrien had the calzone and omg it was so chewy and garlicy and just purrfect. It was huge! And i was surprised my bf finished it. He said it was just so good.  They were also showing a movie on a projector.. A wholesome family movie lol my mom enjoyed it. It was silent so you just read the subtitles.  Their homemade sangria was good. It was more on the sweet side and i liked it. My bf didnt, he said it was too sweet  Their banana pudding was just okay.  But yea, SO GOODDDDDD PIZZA. The appetizers we ordered were pretty good too!

This is the cutest pizzeria, with very friendly service and the owner is often there making sure everything runs well, which it does. The food is really basic Little Italy cafe but it's really good, of course and it fits into the neighborhood so well. I really love the picture window in the front and the atmosphere. It has a variety of craft beers and some signature cocktails, as well as Italian sodas in the cooler. If you become a rewards member, you can get 10 or more point easily every time you go, and you get $10 off when you reach 100 points.",

It is not only fabulous food (Hippie Calzone, Fresconi, Veggie Angeli, Stolen Meatballs - just to name a few), but it is genuinely the most friendly place you will ever visit.  The gentlemen who operate this establishment are brothers and they're amazing - always smiling; warm, attentive, and kind to every single person who walks through their doors.  Don't worry if you're not into friendly people because there are a couple of spots you can snuggle into - to read your paper, check out your latest stocks, or stare out the window and watch passersby.  Plenty of street parking as well as a few parking lots/garages just a short distance away.  Very conveniently located.  Great for lunch.  Great for dinner.  Go check them out!  I promise you will enjoy thoroughly.",

For (sadly) lactose intolerant people like me - they even had vegan cheese, and they accommodated my request and customized my pizza according to what I needed. The ingredients were very high quality, and everything was very fresh.  The service was absolutely exceptional. The restaurant itself is cozy, but so well lit. They have bar seating, and a great cocktail menu. They also have a pretty unique selection of beers. They have a big glass window facing the street which floods the restaurant with light, and I definitely see myself spending time by this window through the upcoming winter.  I'll definitely be back - both because of the quality of food, and the excellent service!",

After trying literally every highly rated pizza/cheesesteak restaurant in Baltimore (Matthew\u2019s, Iggie\u2019s, Paulie Gee\u2019s, Maria D\u2019s) I decided that my Baltimorean friends don\u2019t understand good Italian flavor and to this day I still believe it! All the friends I\u2019ve made in Baltimore did not like pizza- blasphemy right!?- until I took them to Angeli\u2019s. They literally went crazy over the food and we had to order more to satisfy my friends. I\u2019m so glad I was finally able to show my friends real NY style Italian food in Baltimore and validate my palate. Thanks Angeli\u2019s you literally saved Baltimore from mediocre Italian food and you make the best pizza in the city!",

The hefty Italian accents behind the bar informed me that this place wasn't messing around. I'm pretty sure there was some Neopolitan dispute taking place when I arrived, which was great! Authentic food from authentic Italians! Just the way it should be. Do I need to describe the food? Okay, you twisted my arm. I ordered way too much. A salami salad, meatballs, and a slice of pepperoni pizza. Was this simultaneously the best and worst decision I made that day? Yes, yes, it was. I dominated that salad, scarfed the meatballs, and savored the pizza. The pepperonis appropriately (in my opinion) cupped up and pooled the grease into the center. The meatballs were tender, hot, and delicious, with ample marinara sauce. I will also say that the kind gentleman behind the bar who may have owned the place asked: \"How did you find us?\" I told him by searching \"reviews,\" which was true, but I also stumbled upon them, and I'm glad I did. He is also the first person who politely asked me to leave a review, so here I am \u2014 returning the favor of a beautiful experience in Little Italy, Baltimore style.",
