This was my first time getting something from here...but let me tell you, it WILL NOT be my last!!!! I had the beef and rice empanadas. Holy cow! Usually, I will take a picture to go along with a review but after bite #1, I demolished that thang!!! Soooo happy I stopped by. Will be back! I hope they have some of the other flavors I was interested in today on my next visit!! A plus plus guys!! And that mild sauce tho! I love that I can taste the heat but it still has flavor, I can taste the cilantro...which is one of my favorite flavors. I used the whole little cup on my 1 empanada. You have made me a whole fan today, Lito\u2019s. Also, I see reviews about poor service and wrong orders but the lady that I spoke with was real nice and helpful. No complaint on the service.",

My order was so simple and I wasn't even being difficult but it was almost closing time, 5:55pm. She also claimed they were all out of sauces which is fine but her bad attitude made me feel like she just didn't want to deal with me. On top of that, she charged me full price per empanada despite the daily deal of 3 for $11. The difference wasn't worth the trouble. I've worked in the service industry a long time and I get that everyone has bad days but it's not okay to treat customers like an inconvenience. Customers are why we put on our aprons everyday. There are so many other places to choose from in the French Market with kind-hearted people that work hard to keep customers coming back. I regret my decision and I won't be returning here.",
